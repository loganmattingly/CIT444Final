125,321,"Aug 30 2009	We enjoyed our experience and would return to the Desert Rose.	We wanted to explore Las Vegas with our two college-age children. We stayed 4 nights and the 2 bedroom-2 bath suite was perfect for our group. The rooms were nicely furnished, but not to the standard of the high-end strip hotels. WHO CARES? If you want extravagance, stay on the strip. If separate beds and baths, a kitchen and living area are more important, the Desert Rose works well. With different people going different places and keeping different hours, the 2 bed/2 bath set-up provided plenty of privacy for all. PROS: Proximity to the Strip; WIFI; good housekeeping; free parking; free continental breakfast; free beverages and snacks 5-7 pm during the week; grounds were secureSUGGESTIONS: Increase number of tables and chairs in the area adjacent to the pool;add a couple more items at the continental breakfast. With a group like ours, diverse in ages, interests and agendas, we would definitely reccommend and would return to the Desert Inn."
126,321,"Aug 30 2009 	Wow what a gem	This hotel is located right behind the Hooters Casino-Hotel, about 5 minutes from the MGM. I truly loved the service, the rooms, the location. I felt like I was in my condo (kitchen full equipped (even with microwave, blender, pots and pans.. I mean anything you need is there). Front desk is really helpful and the staff is really nice. Room are nice and spacious (with 2 tvs and plenty of room). Before booking this hotel, I read all the reviews because I really need to be comfortable in a hotel room and let me tell you that I was still surprised how nice it was. By the pool you have 2 huge bbq's for your convenience if you want to cook. I've read previous previous saying that they didn't get much for breakfast ! Well, I don't know where they went because at Desert Rose, the breakfast is enough to fill you up until dinner time (cold boiled egg that I heat up in microwave, ham, bread, cereals(3 choices), bananas, muffins, coffee, tea, soda, juice, cheese, yogourt) and it's self service so you eat as much as you need. Helped me save money by just eating out once a dayPlus : Parking is free, 5@7 from Monday to Thursdays with nachos and drinks for free, there a small store at the front desk for snacks etc and it's pretty cheap, there are laundry rooms (self-service I think), nice pool with jacuzziNow the downside : There's nobody holdings doors for you when you have luggage or anything (it's really like as if you were at home), cleaning lady just changes your towels and does bed (nothing like a deep cleaning) on your stay. Honestly I didn't mind at all. I don't like cleaning lady coming everyday in my room to clean especially when it's perfect when I arrive. I also didn't mind not having clerks helping with luggage because this was the only downlfall I saw and for me that's not important.Because MGM is so big and has 2 entry (one on the Strip and the other on Tropicana), you are 5 min from MGM but 7-10 to the Strip. Well, I love walking and when in Vegas, expect to walk alot. So the 10 min to the New York New York Hotel was really nothing. It's so safe in Vegas that we never took a cab (besides for the airport) even after clubbing. There's also Deuce bus on the Strip (3$ a way or 7$ for 24h)Honestly, I'm really please to have stayed at this hotel (it was my little retreat from all the action on the strip)"
127,321,"Aug 29 2009 	Good find	All in all the hotel lived up to our expectations. Friendly staff, good rooms ( although very worn carpet, but I understand they are being replaced--needs it). Very quiet at night--a relief from the hussle and bussle. I would go back to this place. My only critisizm is one that I read by another traveller--and I agree with him. There are not enough lounges for the pool area. Literally, there was a line forming at 8:00 am outside the pool area when it is unlocked in order to obtain one of the few. My wife and I lined up with other guests in order to snag enough for our family--Lets face it --its one of the reasons people go to Vegas to lounge in the sun. The place is great--so spend the bucks and get some more!!! How much can they be?? It would make such a difference"
128,321,"Aug 28 2009 	Truly a Rose in the desert!	Been there done that in Las Vegas and for what this property offers, you won't beat it! Save your money and save your time online.... book it!And that's before I mention the GREAT service. You are a guest and will be treated as such."
129,321,"Aug 26 2009 	A Vegas oasis	A great little resort 2 blocks from the strip, near MGM Grand. Great for families; we could go do something on the strip, then retreat to our little oasis of calm and cool off in the pool. Rooms are nicely equipped... we had a suite with separate bedroom and kitchenette. Not huge, but very functional for our family. Most evenings there is a happy hour (actually 2 hours) with free beer, wine and pop, plus snacks. Lots of parking, which seemed to be pretty secure. Staff were all friendly and helpful; not something I'm used to in Vegas. Will definitely stay there again and recommend to others."
130,321,"Aug 26 2009 	Breakfast is no option! Probably not coming back.	During our trip to the west coast we planned to stay 4 nights in Las Vegas. We're a familly of 5 (3 teenagers children), and had to choose between 2 rooms in one of the big casino hotels on the strip (with great discounted prices on Smartvegas.com) and a all suite hotel off strip. prices were the same. Desert rose had the best reviews on Trip advisor, so we choose the Desert Rose resort. I must say that we were dissapointed. Its not we thought it would be. The place was very crouded. breakfast is no option: small room, long lines (like an attraction in a theme park), noisy, no place to sit (to find a table is like to find a parking spot in midtown Manhattan), and if you find one - its dirty and you have to clean it yourself. poor selection in breakfast: after first morning - my kids didn't want to return. breakfast end at 9 am - not very convient, and from building 4 you have to drive!Rooms are nice and comfortable, no complaints about that, but public corridors are old, not renovated (like an old Motel 6), and open, so during hot summer days it is very unpleasant. The pool was not great either: old, and not so clean. many of the guests is like what you would find in a low grade motel.Business center - if you want to check something in the computer - the rate is &quot;only&quot; $4 for 15 minutes! unbelievable.Next time we probably wont come back. I read again all the reviews on Trip advisor, and I have my thoughts about that, I just say that it looks like the management is very aware to reviews on Trip advisor."
131,321,"Aug 26 2009 	Best thing about Las Vegas!	I searched long and hard to find a room when we were booking our trip to Vegas. After reading all the negative comments about the large resort/casino places I finally picked the Desert Rose. It was the best thing I did for our vacation. The one bedroom was plenty big for 2 people and having the kitchen was a life saver. We lived on water and could keep water and ice in the full size fridge along with juice and milk etc.. The staff was always friendly, holding doors and elevators for us and always said hello and asked how our visit was going. They were alway's smiling and very friendly in general. The breakfast was a great addition to the stay especially when we saw how expensive eating in the large hotels were. (1.25 for one krispy kreme donut!) While the temperatures soared we were very comfortable in the room and spent some time at the nice pool as well. They have grills there and we were able to grill some steaks the last night we were there and relax before leaving in early the next morning. I cannot say enough good about this place. I see some people have commented on how dirty the carpet was but if you saw the city and with the heat and grime they would have to replace the carpet every week to prevent that. I am not sure that would have been any better any place you stay in Vegas. While I would never recommend taking to any child to Vegas for any reason, the unit was comfortable for a small family and I am sure the 2 bedrooms would be even better. While I hesitate to leave this review because it is a well kept secret and I would love to enjoy it again, I feel like I need to give praise where praise is due. If it had not been for the Desert Rose we would have shortened our planned visit and gone home early!"
132,321,"Aug 26 2009 	A Great Place to stay!	This is one of nicest places to stay in La Vegas, it was a vacation. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed and more. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning too. The location is perfect, and we were close to everything. We can't wait to go back."
133,321,"Aug 25 2009 	Desert Rose Las Vegas is a pleasant relaxing vacation.	Our trip was an unexpexted one. It was a weekend to spend with our children before they started college. Desert Rose was very willing to accomodate us on the same day. We arrived late because of traffic and they had our room waiting for us and were more than willing to bring us any extra necessities we needed. For my husband and I it was plus that it was walking distance from Hooters,Tropicana, Luxor. It is very close to the strip,but also very quiet. It was nice that they offered a continental breakfast every day. They aalso have a happy hour on Monday- through Thursdays. To us it was a very relaxing weekend."
134,321,"Aug 25 2009 	Best Kept Secret in Las Vegas	We have been going to Las Vegas for the last 16 years and have always stayed at a hotel from (7 to 11days). This year we heard of the Desert Rose Resort from friends and I decided to check out the reviews from different sources.We decided to try it and boy did we hit a jackpot. We had a 1 bedroom condo and the staff could not serve us enough, as they were very friendly and always accomodating to our needs.The rooms were very clean and we always had extra towels in our room every day. Good variety for a continental breakfast items, ( breads, fresh fruit , cereals, cheese, and starbuck coffee available 24hrs, and Monday to Thursday was the Managers reception, beer, wine, juices, snacks and all of this was included. A 7 minute walk to MGM where you could get the monorail to go to the other end of the strip, and 10 minutes to the main strip. We certainly will be booking next year at the Desert Rose Resort.Good place for a family as it has a pool and the cost was very reasonable."
135,321,"Aug 25 2009	The price is right!!!	Surprised and happy with this choice. Staff is welcoming, courteous and helpful. Nice continental breakfast service. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Nice kitchen with appliances, dishware, etc. Not the Bellagio...but then you are NOT paying those prices!"
136,321,"Aug 23 2009 	A Pleasant Stay in Hot Las Vegas	We had a nice two bedroom apartment with two bathrooms and a kitchen. The place was spacious but showing wear and tear in the living room area. It was reasonably clean and the central air conditioning worked very well in this heat. The complex is part of a time share and filled with diverse groups of people. The front desk was pleasant and the breakfast was adequate, pastry,fruit, cold cuts, hard boiled eggs, toast, bagels, cereal, juice and Starbuck's coffee. The complex is located next to Hooter's and near MGM Grand, Tropicana and Luxor. We saw two shows, Ka at MGM Grand and Criss Angel -Believe at the Luxor. Ka was visually spectacular and recommended. Criss Angel's show was weird magic, dance and slight comedy . It was suppose to be Cirque Du Soleil too but it was not like &quot;O&quot; or Ka. Believe was disjointed and a disappointment.The Desert Rose was convenient to the Strip and parking was adequate. It is also close to the airport but we didn't hear any airport noise. I liked it because it is quiet and not overwhelmingly large and busy."
137,321,"Aug 23 2009 	Best and most relaxing haven on two week road trip	We spent 13 nights on the road, and the Desert Rose was the best place we stayed. After eating out day after day, it was great to have a place to spread out and cook something as simple as macaroni and cheese for a break. We didn't actually get out much to see Las Vegas and the sites since it was so relaxing. Our two teenagers were comfortable and they established their areas from the first moment...one in one room, and the other in the other room.It was also close enough to walk to the strip without too much trouble."
138,321,"Aug 21 2009 	Enjoyable stay with kids in Las Vegas!	We choose the Desert Rose based on the reviews in Tripadvisor. A great move! We travel with two boys aged 12 and 9 years. The rooms are great, comfortable beds, full kitchen and breakfast included. Do get in time for breakfast because it does get very busy. Between 5 and 7 you have managers drinks. Beer, wine and snacks. Really good value for money. The location is another big plus. Very close to the strip but not on the strip. The size of the resort is good. We have walked through the big mega hotels (with long long lines for check in) and were very glad to be at the Desert Rose. Our boys found their own way and went swimming, this would never have been the case in the big hotels.The service was quick, prompt and very friendly. The concierge we only saw once, so if you want something organised you better do it yourself."
139,321,"Aug 21 2009 	Surpassed my expectations again.	Returned to the Desert Rose for a third time this year, this time staying in a one bed condo. 2008 stayed in 2 bed condo's. condo was roomy with a well layed out kitchen area.The wholr resort was extremely clean and maid service came in every day while we were there to clean and replace towels. Free breakfast was just what I needed each day, plenty of variety, and good coffee. Pool was fantastic and never got to busy, my children 3 and 2 loved it. This is our favorite place to stay in Vegas. The prices for the weekend we went were fantastic $46/night. You cannot beat this place for the price and with the free breakfast and fully equipped kitchen you are not forced to go out and spend $$$ on eating out."
140,321,"Aug 21 2009 	Awesome location!!!	This is a beautiful resort and the price is Out of this world for the awesome location. We stayed for a week and the room had plenty of extras, so we declined daily maid service. It was our own little home away from home...we bought groceries to keep from having to spend money on fast food. It was nice for the kids to be able to grab some breakfast and watch tv in the mornings in their own room while we relaxed on the couch and drank our coffee. The location made it easy to take a break from the strip to stop back at the room for a snack or a little nap...especially with our 1 yr old...with the &quot;FULLY EQUIPT&quot; kitchen you have everything you need, even cleaning supplies ex. (broom, iron, board, dish soap, dishwasher detergent, sponges, paper towels, etc) they even have clothes baskets for you to use at their on site laundry facilities....we have found our yearly vacation spot!!!!!"
141,321,"Aug 20 2009 	Enjoyable Stay	My family of six stayed at this hotel recently. We booked a 2-bedroom and a 1-bedroom suite. My two teenage daughters loved the second bedroom of the 2-bedroom suite because of the two twin beds and that they did not have to share a bed. The beds were comfy and the linens were soft. We never experienced the pool but we had a view of it from our suite and it was constantly full (even at 7 in the morning). Only my husband experienced the free breakfast because he is an early riser and the breakfast is concluded by 9am during the week. However, he did say it was very crowded and hectic and not worth the hassle. Perhaps extending the service hours by one hour would help to ease the congestion. Another complaint that I had was there was no stationary or writing pens in the rooms. Each day, when leaving a tip for housekeeping, I would have to find scratch paper to write on to indicate the use for the money. My husband also noticed that while he waited for us in lobby that there are no televisions or magazines to occupy your time. I would also recommend that the hotel increase the number of TV channels they provide in the guest rooms. It should also be mentioned that the two interior parking areas were closed and it caused the remaining front lots to fill up quickly in the evening. On a few occasions we were required to park two buildings away from our unit and had to go through the building maze to get to our unit. We did notice that the hotel had security officers constantly walking the premise so we felt very safe. Overall, when you add the negatives against the positive, it was a very pleasant stay and we would definitely return when in Las Vegas."
142,321,"Aug 20 2009 	No Hassel living""	My husband and I went to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary. We also invited my sister and friend whose birthday's were also in 08/2009 along with their significant partners....We had a great time in Las Vegas and it was nice to return to our hotel which was clean, cool, and provided all the ammneties it had to offer such as &quot;free continental breakfast&quot; plus breakfast delivery to Shell Vacation Elite members....my guest loved the hotel, the cleanliness, the hotel staff especiall the housekeeping staff. I think anyone staying with the Desert Rose Resort will be treated to a great experience."
143,321,"Aug 19 2009 	Sanity in the middle of Sin City!	We love staying at the desert rose! It is so convenient to the strip but allows you to also &quot;escape&quot; the casino environment and come home to some peace and quiet. The staff is very friendly, the rooms are wonderful. Having a kitchen is a great help with all of the great leftovers you have in Vegas. We love the continental breakfast and the happy hours. Will definately stay again when I come back to Vegas!"
144,321,"Aug 17 2009 	We are always happy here!	My family and I travel to Las Vegas 3 or 4 times a year. When I travel with my husband alone, we always stay at a casino hotel, but when we have our 4 children(ages 3-14) we love the Desert Rose. With 4 kids we need lots of room and some privacy. It is nice to be in 1 suite and not 2 rooms that are joined with a double door. As a mom, I love the fact that I lock the front door and secure it and they are all in a room with me, not lock there door and then shut the door in the middle and hope they don't lock it and then I can't get in either door. The Desert Rose is at a great location, right behind Hooter's so you can walk to MGM, Mandalay Bay, Excalibur, Luxor, NYNY, Tropicana, Monte Carlo and a lot of shops like the M&amp;M store. If you don't want to wait for a taxi there you can walk to Hooter's less then a block away, there are always taxi's there waiting for customers. The pool is great, the continental breakfast is very good and saves you $, it actually has ham served along with the normal stuff you find at others. They also have a meet and greet thing in the evening, serving free beer, wine, soda &amp; snacks for kids. The service is always great, the people are always friendy and the rooms are always clean. The best thing about this place is it is not a casino, so you don't have all the busy activity and people to get around to get to your room. It is a place for anyone, wether on business or vacation, alone or with family. We highly recommend this resort. We will be back.The only thing I recommend is during hot months ask for 2nd or 3rd floor rooms. During hot month crikets and desert cockroaches push their way in to the room through any crack on the 1st floor. It's not a big issue cause they do it at homes there to. The hotel is clean and they spray for bugs. When we had a few they came right over and got rid of them and sprayed the room with a non toxic odorless spray. We love it there, and are sure you will too!!! Look for the specials link on the website, we got a 2 bedroom suite for $99 a night when we payed up front. nywhere else would have cost $150 with no breakfast offers."
145,321,"Aug 16 2009 	Best Stay in a Very Long Time !	This Resort is one of the Best I have stayed at in many years. I go back to some because I get used to them, but sometimes you just need to break away and make a change when things are not as they use to be. That's when I found your resort and It's AWESOME !!!!!!!!! The staff they have here really enjoy what they do and it shows.They all were a Big part in me making the decision to go back again. Great Resort and I will be back, with guest."
146,321,Aug 14 2009 	Excellent Place to stay	Just returned from a two-week stay at the Desert Rose Resort.No complaints at all. If you are looking for a great base with no casino and a few minutes to strip I would recommend this place. Read all the other positive reviews as I did and you will not be disappointed. We will be returning in the near future.
147,321,"Aug 14 2009 	Comfortable Friendly with a Great Price	This a comfortable apartment style hotel close to the strip. It is quiet, clean and friendly. Breakfast is offered every day and provides enough food to carry you through to dinner. The pool area is not large and there is a scramble every morning to grab a free lounger. Rooms are clean and well maintained and all of the appliances are new and work properly.The complimentary manager's reception during the week is a lovely perk. I would stay there again on my next trip to Las Vegas."
148,321,"Aug 13 2009 	great stay!!	stayed at desert rose from august 3rd to the 6th, 2 bedroom suite, everything went well!! for the price it is a good deal!! me &amp; wife &amp; 3 daughters stayed here, we will consider this again! everthing went well, good value for the $$ great location!! met our expectations, not bad at all!! probably will stay here again!!!"
149,321,"Aug 13 2009 	Relaxing and Fun	We own a timeshare in Las Vegas but was not able to reserve our room when we foundout our daughter and grandaughter were coming to visit. So we went on line and wantedsomething close to the airport and and nice in ammenities, that we were accustomed to.Desert Rose was that place! We could walk to the strip or catch the monorail. Our roomwas very comfortable and had everything we needed. The pool and grounds were cleanand staff was very friendly. I would stay again and recommend to friends and family."
150,321,Aug 11 2009 	What a nice surprise!	The room was so cute. It was also great that it was a suite. We had just come back from rafting in the Grand Canyon and it was nice to have space to spread out. You can't go wrong with the price. I wish there were warm meats for breakfast rather than deli meat...but the other offerings made up for it.Definitely something to consider when going to Vegas.
151,321,Aug 11 2009 	Good Location with amenities	We stayed a week visiting relatives and friends and sightseeing. The location is good as it is a short walk and you are on the Strip. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was clean but is getting tired and in need of some refurbishing of carpets etc. Great continental breakfast and every afternoon free wine and beer and snacks. We had followed a previous review and requested the second floor and it was quiet. Even the checkin clerk admitted that the compressors on the roof are loud for the 3rd floor. They gave away trips on the weekend during the &quot;social hour&quot;. Pool is nice and had small exercise room. It was great having a kitchen and livingroom etc.
152,321,Aug 10 2009 	GREAT PLACE GREAT PRICE!	I stayed at the Desert Rose Resort for one night but wish I stayed the whole vacation. After we checked in we had a welcoming courtesy call. They offer a complimentary breakfast and do a happy hour. The hotel is beautiful and a one bedroom hotel for the cost of 100 or less is Great! Would definitly stay there again. Was right across from Luxor and Tropicana so location is great also!!
153,321,"Aug 7 2009 	So nice	Nice location for roomy place to stayWould come again if visiting LV in the future. Have stayed at Planet Hollywood, Luxor, Paris and Flamingo but this is my favourite. Situated behind Hooters and Tropicana, this place is so comfortable. It is a Time Share location but stay there like any hotel. Security is hot there and you should be at ease."
154,321,"Aug 7 2009 	perfect	clean,quiet,comfortable,perfect location! stayed 2 nights after exploring zion,brryce.GC"
155,321,"Aug 7 2009 	Great value perfect place for families	We just spent a night at the Desert Rose. It was a great deal for a family with young kids. Well updated room. Good (unfortunately too crowded) breakfast. Walking distance to MGM Grand, New York New York and Excelsior. Comfortable beds, even the foldout couch. Great A/C. Quiet. Definitely stay here.Oh, and the security personnel was excellent. We got a call at night letting us know that there was an electornic device in the car that was turned on. My husband went to the car to check and the security guy was waiting for him to explain that it's best for us to take the portable DVD player inside, which we did. That's going beyond the call of duty in my book."
156,321,"Aug 6 2009 	Great for families and friends!	Stayed in a 1bdrm and 2bdrm during this stay with friends (i had been here before as a timeshare owner) - both families have toddlers. Very family friendly, great pool, incl. a small kid's pool... full kitchen is fantastic and a must-have with kids! nice little porch to hang out on.... Location is great - it is right behind tropicana. easy/short walk across the street to MGM Grand! Free breakfast is decent - coffee is starbucks! clean and pretty modern. had an awesome stay!"
157,321,"Aug 5 2009 	Awesome hotel!!	We stayed here for about 4 nights, it's a great hotel. We stayed in a two bedroom apartment and it was very nice. And we were very surprised about the price, I thought it was wrong at first.My husband and I stayed in the main bedroom which also fit a crib for our 18month old son. It had an extremely comfortable king size bed, a tv and a really nice ensuite.My sister-in-law and her son stayed in the other bedroom that had a queen bed and a tv.And my brother-in-law stayed on the lounge which had a pull-out sofa.The room had a small balcony, a full kitchen (which was so awesome) and a small dining table and a second bathroom. It had aircon and a really nice pool and spa. It also had a toddler pool which was fantastic for my son. The hotel also had elevators, a laundry room (not free) and internet access (I think it was free, check the website).All up, we stayed in America for 7 weeks and this was one of the best hotels we stayed at.The only down-falls were that a few times I called the desk for some things and they took a while to deliver them...... And the carpet is a bit dirty, so wear your shoes around the room otherwise your socks get disgusting. Didn't encounter any bugs.Highly recommended hotel."
158,321,"Aug 5 2009 	Ideal location family friendly clean and spacious close to Strip but quiet	We have just returned from a week in Las Vegas at the Desert Rose. As a family of four we found the Desert Rose to be a fabulous location and ideal for our needs. Buffet breakfast was fantastic, rooms were huge and contained every convenience. For mum, dad and two daughters of 15 and 21, two one-bedroomed apartments were ideal. Pool facilities are fantastic and manager's 'happy hour every Mon. to Fri. brings guests together. Just 5 minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip gives one the choice of stepping in and out of the full-on Vegas experience at will. Most highly recommended. Maureen and family (in Vegas for Robbie and Lindsay's wedding, July 29th 2009)"
159,321,"Aug 5 2009 	Home Away from Home	We booked our room online so we weren't sure if it would be a deal or a dud. We were very pleasantly surprised! There wasn't a day go by that we didn't at some point say how glad we were that we stayed at the DR instead of on the Strip. While we only stayed 3 nights, we felt completely at home.If you want a retreat from the fast pace of the Strip but want to be able to hop right back into the shows and casinos when you're ready, DR is the place for you!We're already talking about our next trip to Vegas and wouldn't stay anywhere else."
160,321,Aug 4 2009 	Excellent value clean 	We booked 2 two bedroom units for the 8 of us and would gladly stay at this venue again. The internet wasn't free back in Feb - that was the only downside. We booked it via expedia while home in Australia and everything went to plan. An excellent holiday.
161,321,"Aug 3 2009 	Wish I had found Desert Rose the First time around.	After staying at NY-NY Hotel and Casino, it was Such a Relief to finish our vacation up at Desert Rose. Upon entering our 2 room suite at Desert Rose, both of our teenagers (girl and boy, 16 &amp; 18) asked if we could extend our vacation. Unlike Casino hotels, the Desert Rose is there to serve you as an overnight guest...... you won't get the feeling (as we did at other hotels right on the strip) that the &quot;hotel&quot; is an afterthought of the casino. We were very pleased to say the least, and felt lucky that we had discovered this hotel."
162,321,Aug 3 2009 	Wonderful experience	We really enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful and always pleasant. The total vacation was very wonderful. Thank you very much for all the help.
163,321,"Jul 31 2009 	Everything Came Up Roses at DRR	I just stayed at Desert Rose Resort (DRR), from 27 to 30 July, and I'm happy to report that, once again, following the advice of Trip Advisor (TA) and booking accordingly paid off. I usually stay at one of the Strip hotels or South Point (see my review for that property; still my favorite hotel overall in Vegas), but when I read TA's reviews and noted its very high ranking (no. 4 when I booked last week) for DRR -- and then found a great rate on Expedia ($46/night for a prepaid booking) -- I decided to try something different. I'm glad I did. DRR lives up to the high praise from fellow TA reviewers: its location, suites, and amenities are all excellent; and if you can get anything close to the rate I paid (or close to, say, $100/night on weekends; I usually avoid Vegas on weekends, though), I highly recommend the property.I asked for -- and got -- a nice one-bedroom suite on the third floor of a building on the back side (i.e. closest to the Strip) of the property. (DRR is a garden-apartment style resort, with three-story buildings arranged in a square around the central pool and reception areas.) Checking in and parking couldn't be easier: the process took 2 minutes, and I was off with my room keys and map to park around back, right next to my building. All the gates to the buildings and main facilities are locked and accessible only with one's room key, which worked every time I used it. My suite was just fine: as promised, full kitchen, granite countertops, separate bedroom. The decor and furnishings are very similar to those at the South Point Hotel, so much so -- especially in the bathroom -- that I think DRR used the same company for its makeover. I had two TVs -- they were large CRT units, rather than the promised flatscreens, but that wasn't an issue, as I don't use TVs much in Vegas hotels. Both TVs worked and provided plenty of free channels, and it was handy having one in the living room and one in the bedroom. As some other reviewers have noted, the suites have good, strong A/C (70s/80s-style lever thermostat but works fine), but the temperature in my bedroom was always a few degrees warmer than that in the living area. No matter; I just kept the thermostat low, and the BR was sufficiently cool. I didn't partake of the free continental breakfast, but I appreciated the Starbucks coffee available throughout the day and early evening in the lobby, as well as the free beer and wine from 5 to 7 p.m. Again, a nice touch that sets the DRR apart from most other Vegas hotels.One of the best features of DRR is its location. Las Vegas, which is rarely free of traffic problems, has become particularly unfriendly to the automobile as of late, especially on the surface roads just east of the Strip. Many of the most heavily used roads, including Koval, Harmon, Flamingo, and Tropicana, are undergoing major, traffic jam-inducing reroutings and repairs. Fortunately, DRR is easy to get to, even with the upheaval taking place on Tropicana, and it's a very short drive or walk to the Strip. (The hotel is also accessible from Reno Rd., which is free of construction and leads right to the Strip.) Parking is a dream; you park right next to your building, and that's it. DRR is not very big, either, which adds to its human feel.While I'm a solo traveler, I noticed lots of families with kids at DRR, and I can see why: it's an outstanding value for families, and it really is an attractive, user-friendly property. The full kitchens, decent (though only adequate) pool, and other family-friendly facilities make DRR an excellent choice for most travelers. At night, the property is very quiet, and when in my room, I heard no noise from other guests. If you've been to Vegas before, you know what a rare treat that is. The free wireless internet, which I found to be fast and reliable, is also a great touch and one that you don't find in most Vegas hotels. Unlike some properties that give one limited free wifi in, say, their lobbies or pool areas, DRR's free wifi is available everywhere on the property, including in your suite.While I'll probably stay at one of my favorite regular hotels (S. Point or THEHotel) next time -- I do like the buzz of the bigger hotels -- I'm sure I'll stay again at DRR at some point in the future, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a great lodging value in Las Vegas."
164,321,"Jul 30 2009 	WAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Will start by saying that is the best to stay in Vegas. Desert Rose rooms are not typical hotels rooms, are small apartments. Full kitchen, nice bed, and even a dishwasher. What else: free breakfast, free internet and weekly happy hour with wine and beer. Superb customer service. Well located. Just 5 minutes walk to the Strip through a street between the Desert Rose and the Hooters hotel. No casino, so quiet. Ten minutes to the airport. Only minor complaint could be the small bathroom. But not an issue. I have stayed in the many Vegas hotels, including the Signature. But, after this recent stay in the Desert Rose, it will be my new home in Vegas. In summary: Desert Rose is the place to be in Vegas!"
165,321,Jul 30 2009 	Overall it was a wonderful hotel!!!	The hotel was awesome it was great having free breakfast in the morning. It was also nice being only two blocks away from the strip. Our room was also fantastic having a full kitchen was a big plus. The only thing that we didn't love was the pool. The area was nice but we were hoping for a bigger pool. But other than that the hotel was great!
166,321,Jul 30 2009 	Wonderful hotel reasonable rates	Stayed for three nights. The rooms are large and clean. Great air conditioning. Very nice pool. Enjoyed the breakfast and the happy hour that had beer and snacks. Located about a block from the Strip! Great hotel for a reasonable rate.
167,321,"Jul 29 2009 	Overall nice place except for the bugs!!!	The hotel is situated in a very convenient location and has a lot of perks. The rooms are cozy and the kitchen is new and great for families. I would have really liked to recommend this hotel, except for a couple of little things crawling around. Yes, the roaches were a huge downfall in our experience. Roaches in the bathroom, around the outside and unfortunately in the lobby where the breakfast is served. The only excuse we were given is the heat. I'm not too sure I buy the excuse, because this is a big chain and they should try to really get rid of the problem. I've stayed at other resorts that experience hot weather like Vegas, and guess what, no ROACHES."
168,321,"Jul 29 2009 	Great place to stay.	The Desert Rose is a great place to stay with your family, while in Vegas. It is just off the strip, great rooms and staff. There were 5 of us and the 2 bedroom suite was nice and large. The continental breakfast was well stocked with muffins, toast, fruit, bagels, hard boiled eggs, and cereal. Was nice not having to go out to eat for breakfast while staying there. Happy Hour from 5pm-7pm on the weeknights is a plus. They served beer, wine, pop, nacho's and pretzels. We paid $65.40 a night for our room, and there were no hidden fees. Small but nice pool for swimming, had bbq grills and picnic tables if you want to grill. This was our families first time in Vegas and we would definitely stay here again."
169,321,Jul 28 2009 	The Desert Rose Resort is absolutely wonderful!	Our stay at the Desert Rose Resort was absolutely wonderful. The rooms were excellent. The staff was excellent. Everything was excellent. I would recommend this resort to anyone.
170,321,"Jul 28 2009 	Nice Rooms	The rooms were very nice and I loved that they had kitchen supplies - it really cut down on our cost for eating out because we were able to prepare meals in the room. I was not a fan of the breakfast however, I would of preferred something hot instead of the selection they offered. All in all...nice place."
171,321,Jul 25 2009 	Great experience for the family	My family truly enjoyed the stay at Desert Rose Resort. The staff was very helpful and kind wiht any questions and help around the resort. WIll stay there again when going to Vegas.
172,321,"Jul 25 2009 	Like staying at a timeshare without the presentation	Booked based on reviews and price. Close to the south end of the strip ( 1 block from MGM, Tropicana, Luxor, Excalibur). Nice accomodations, full kitchen, quiet. Nice that you don't have to walk forever from your car to your room. (like the big casinos) Liked the complimentary happy hour (beer, wine, soft drinks, nuts, few snacks). Staff very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again."
173,321,"Jul 24 2009 	Perfect for a Girls Getaway	We had a two bedroom two bathroom suite, and it was ideal for three ladies. There were two twin size beds in one room and a king size bed in the other. There was even a queen size hide-a-bed in the living room. We could have easily had up to three more ladies in this suite for a VERY, VERY reasonable price. Our suite was very clean, though a little worn (the furniture and the carpet could stand to be replaced). The bathrooms were immaculate, the beds were sooo comfy, and the sheets were so nice that we were all trying to figure out what kind they were so we could get some for our beds back home. It was great having a full kitchen and a dining table with seating for 4. There is a Wal-mart 3 - 5 miles away, but be warned - if you don't have a car it will cost you $45 round trip by taxi to go there for supplies. There was a flat screen TV in the living room and 32 inch TV's in each bedroom. There was even a balcony with two chairs on it where our one smoker was able to sit just off of the living room and smoke. She visits Vegas often, and she said this was fantastic because she usually stays at one of the casinos and has to go all the way downstairs into the casino to smoke (she prefers a non-smoking room because of her non-smoking husband). The breakfast was very good, with lots of variety. The managers reception was really nice considering that drinks were costing us $7 - $12 EACH in the clubs and bars on the strip. This place is located just off of the south end of the strip, adjacent to the airport, about a 5 - 10 minute walk to MGM, Luxor, Excaliber. Even though it is so close to the airport that I think it shares a property line, we were never bothered by planes landing or taking off. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. This is definitely the place to stay if you have a family gathering or a group of friends that want to stay together but don't want to be crowded into a standard hotel room. Really, I can't say enough good things about this place."
174,321,Jul 23 2009 	Nice place	Check in was quick and easy. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a 1-bedroom suite. It was very spacious. The full kitchen came in handy. Overall it was a great stay.
175,321,"Jul 23 2009 	We had a great stay	We had a wonderful stay, the staff and Housekeeping were very helpful and friendly. The room we had was a 1 bedroom and it was beautiful. 1 block away from Hooters and 2 blocks from the vegas strip. We thought it was wonderful. We would definitely go back again."
176,321,"Jul 22 2009 	Very comfortable and quiet	First time here but it won't be the last. Quiet, and we loved the complimentary breakfast in the AM. The only complaint was the washing machines were not working."
177,321,"Jul 21 2009 	A nice spot near the strip for a family	The Desert Rose was easy to find as four tired travelers made our way in from the car rental station at the airport. Check-in was a breeze. Once we got to the suite, the kids instantly decided that they loved the room with the queen bed and the couch. My wife and I woke early the next morning and hit the limited breakfast (that was because service started a bit later on weekends). We made a trip down Tropicana to Vons in order to pick up some supplies for the rest of the week. I even had a little time after breakfast to walk down to the Strip with the two (under 10 minutes to get to the bridge between the Tropicana and Excalibur) before we had to head to the airport for our 3-day rafting trip. My wife was on her own for the next two nights, and the concierge (who was fantastic) helped her decide the best ways to hit the Strip and see some shows at night. The hotel is also very close to the airport (an easy cab ride) but we didnt hear any noise from the busy airport. One common question on the forums is whether it's safe to walk back to the hotel at night, and my wife (who doesn't like big cities) said that she never felt uncomfortable. What are some of the negatives about this hotel? The rooms will probably be a letdown for anyone that thinks they are going to a top-of-the-line resort thats just off the strip, based on the stellar rating on TA. That is not the case, and to the Desert Roses credit, they are only billed as a 3-star hotel on TA. Ive found that bathrooms say a lot about a hotel. The ones in our room left a lot to be desired, especially the one of the master bedroom, which was tiny. The resort also had a very crowded feeling at times, such as the peak times for the breakfasts/receptions, any time that the pool was in demand, or even when trying to find a parking space for the night. One other thing our teenagers commented on was the odor we were hit with when we walked down to the Strip through the Hooters lot. Thats nothing that the Desert Rose can control this, but it did make a lasting impression on our kids. Bottom line: would I stay here again? Maybe, if I were going on the same sort of trip where I needed a place for room our full family of four to stretch out for two nights, and one that was close enough to the strip that my wife could walk to some of the shows on the two nights that three of us were gone. But I'd probably pick somewhere else if walking to the strip was not a consideration, since it is very easy to drive from other parts of town to some of the casinos, if needed. And I also would suggest against the hotel for anyone who is interested in being in the hustle and bustle of some of the four or five star casino resorts in Vegas -- the Desert Rose would not fit their desires. I also think it's a bit of a stretch to call the hotel a &quot;Resort&quot;, since it is just a quality 3-star hotel a block off the strip. I knocked my overall rating down a notch because of that, since the hotel does seem to be a bit overrated on TA. I also rounded down because of the followup email that the Shell Hospitality group sent out with a link to the TA review, since that probably contributes to overrating problem on TA."
178,321,"Jul 21 2009	Great place - great value and location and family-friendly	This is a comfortable, clean, convenient no-casino hotel with a great free weekday happy hour with beer, wine and snacks and a nice lobby to hang out with friends. The pool was great and having all suites with kitchens was a big plus. Perfect home base for our Grand Canyon rafting trip!"
179,321,"Jul 19 2009 	Great Place Second Time even better than the First	The front desk was wonderful and even helped us switch rooms. We ended up being one of those groups that kept having to ask for help. They were wonderful every time.Great Location, easy walk but no casino crowds or noise."
180,321,Jul 18 2009 	Very nice front desk staff	The location was convenient and walking distance to the Strip. The complementary breakfast and coffee were nice to have. The front desk was very helpful during both check-in and check out.
181,321,"Jul 18 2009	great place great staff great service.	The staff was friendly, and helpful. The room was quiet and very comfortable, and CLEAN. The pool was great. We enjoyed our stay very much and we WILL return again."
182,321,"Jul 17 2009 	An Oasis in the City	This hotel exceeded all of our expectations. Our two bedroom apartment was not ready when we checked in, but we were given two, one-bedroom apartments which worked out great for us. The beds were extremely comfortable and the apartments were quite luxurious, spacious, and well-furnished. Coffee was provided in the room each day (Starbucks) and toiletries were always replenished. We had read complaints about the breakfast, so were pleasantly surprised by the abundance of food offered. There were bagels, packaged danish and muffins, bread, cheese, turkey or ham, boiled eggs, and fruit along with gourmet coffee, sodas, and juices. There were always lots of people there and no seats were available, so we always took the food back to the apartment and prepared it there. I was amazed that the staff was able to replenish the food so quickly, as people were taking it as fast as it could be put out. The hotel offers a happy hour for two hours each day (5-7), with complimentary wine, beer, sodas, and snacks. The pool was refreshing, but very busy during the weekend. The spa was nice and hot. There were plenty of chairs around the pool. The location was excellent....two blocks from Luxor and MGM. We had a car and usually drove to a hotel / casino and used the valet to park there ($3 tip). It was so hot that this worked out great (though the valet lots were sometimes full, in which case we self-parked in the lot). However, it is an easy walk from the hotel to Luxor, MGM, and Hooters from the hotel (10-15 minutes). I highly recommend this wonderful hotel. It was our home away from home for four nights and we would definitely stay here again if we return to Vegas."
183,321,"Jul 17 2009 	Totally recommended!	Great, clean, calm place and I agree with most of the positive comments already summarized by others. One thing I would like to add is: have you ever seen the check in/check out lines in the Luxor, MGM, Bellagio etc? A nightmare- they are miles long! You won't have this problem here because is a much smaller and more personal place! I certainly will come back here if I should visit Las Vegas again!"
184,321,Jul 17 2009 	short walk to strip	We had a great stay at the Desert Rose. We had breakfast in our room every day and free beer at happy hour in the lobby. It was a short walk to the MGM Grand and Luxor. Always plenty to do in Las Vegas. Fitness room and pool were available. We would definately return again. Also free internet.
185,321,"Jul 17 2009 	Family friendly without all the dingdingding	We were in Vegas for a karate tournament that my husband and young daughters competed in. It was also the weekend for UFC 100, so it was quite busy. Desert Rose Resort was close enough to the strip to be where we wanted when we wanted, but it was far enough away to be away from all the slot machines and noise of the strip. The rooms were beautiful and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was quick and easy enough to get us going in the morning. The staff was friendly and helpful."
186,321,Jul 17 2009 	What a great hotel !	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 2 weeks in June after seeing it on our last visit in Vegas in September (when we stayed elsewhere) and we were not disappointed.The room was lovely and spacious and cleaned daily to a high standard. We had only one problem with our hairdryer and that was replaced within 10 minutes of my enquiry.The pool was lovely with whirlpool and free towels.Could maybe do with a few more chairs/loungers but seeing as people are coming and going from the pool all day it's no great problem to get one.The free breakfast and managers reception was an added bonus.The staff are all very friendly and helpful whatever your request.It is very quiet and as we are not gamblers it is great not to have the bustle of a casino.Only 15 or so minutes to the MGM Grand for the monorail and about the same to the strip for the deuce.All in all a brilliatnt place to stay and we have already booked for 2 weeks end of June next year.
187,321,"Jul 17 2009 	So glad we chose the Desert Rose Resort!	We traveled to Las Vegas in early April. At the time, our son was 20 months old, so we wanted a quiet place to stay that had a separate spot for him to sleep. The Desert Rose Resort was perfect! It was off the strip, but not too far. It was quiet and very spacious. The staff were very helpful and friendly.This place is perfect for families with young children, or for someone who wants a quiet non-flashy place to stay. If you're looking for a hotel with a casino, this is not for you. Otherwise, stay here! You won't be disappointed."
188,321,"Jul 16 2009 	great family hotel	A wonderful, low-key break from the casinos. Easy access to the Strip, but far enough away to escape for a quiet evening. Particularly good for family travel with teenage or younger children. Resort was well maintained. Only downsides included very slow wireless internet connection and noise from air conditioning unit."
189,321,"Jul 15 2009 	Best Place for family near the strip	We stayed at Desert Rose for 4 nights on our trip to Las Vegas recently. This is a family-friendly establishment with nice rooms, balcony, high-speed wireless, free breakfast, evening reception on weekdays, exceptional pool facility and fitness center, and within walking distance to the strip. To top it off, their prices are amazingly low. Our kids stayed in the pool most of the time because it was extremely hot in Vegas. They also made lots of friends in the pool and left us alone to enjoy. None of us like gambling, but we took a stroll along the strip in the nights to enjoy people and architecture. Kids loved the Adventuredome at circus-circus and hiking in the nearby red rock canyon. Highly recommended for families."
190,321,"Jul 15 2009 	Great Hotel 	I just loved this hotel. For the value and the location. Its right by the airport and by the strip which is nice. The rooms were awesome! The moment you step into the lobby they were the friendliest group of workers in the the whole state of nevada. They took care of everything and promptly as well. Even security was deligjhtful I believe her name was Lisa she helped me with directions.In the words of Aronld, &quot; I WILL BE BACK&quot;."
191,321,"Jul 15 2009 	Great Alternative to LV Hotels with great value	Friendly and efficient reservations and onsite staff. A little slow at check in when groups arrive. Size of registration desk is fairly small and number of employees to process registrations is limited. Managers specials, breakfast and happy hours are backlogged because of poor traffic flow and limited space to accommodate the guests trying to be served. Minor nuisance waiting in line but it's offset by the nice facilities, friendly staff and value when compared to the typical LV hotel. I would recommend to others traveling to LV. Have fun!"
192,321,"Jul 15 2009 	great	the hotel couldn't have been more convenient, clean or comfortable. will definitely stay here again!"
193,321,"Jul 14 2009 	Hotel halls not clean but room was big.	I was not impressed when I walked down the hall to my room and the carpet in the hall was dirty. When I complained about the carpet being dirty I was told by the front desk I was told that they sometimes clean the carpet. No management was offered to speak with me. Also, I thought the pool was cloudy and there was no towels when I went to the pool at the end of the day. I did not care for the outside appearance of the facility. I thought it looked a lot better on line. The daily breakfast was great and a big savings. The 2 bedroom unit met my family of five needs and was big enough for us to be very comfortable. Overall I was not impressed. I felt that for 150.00 per night I could have stayed in a nicer place on the strip."
194,321,"Jul 14 2009 	very comfortablegood size rooms clean would recommend.	We were very pleased with this hotel, we had a two bed apartment that was well equipped (although no hotel in America seems to supply kettle and t-bags!!) only coffee maker, it was clean and tidy. There is a short walk to the strip - not far and its really nice to have somewhere quieter to come away from the strip to.Complimentary breakfast,very good but be early to get a seat. Good pool and seating, we were traveling three teenagers, this was the best hotel we stayed in for space/value."
195,321,"Jul 14 2009 	Great alternative from a casino hotel...simple but close to everything.	We caught a rafting trip from here...it was clean, large rooms, surprisingly quiet and only a block from the MGM. A cab ride to the airport was only $8-10. Breakfast was ok, the staff very friendly/helpful and a mini-store was next to the front desk. Compared to the monster casino hotels, it was nice to walk in right to the front desk and get to your room within a couple minutes. It is larger than it seems, eat breakfast early or stake our your pool chair before the crowd wakes up."
196,321,"Jul 14 2009 	Fantastic hotel - would highly recommennd	Just returned (13th July 2009) from a 2 week stay at the Desert Rose Resort, great place to stay, located about 5 mins, (slow walk), from the strip, friendly staff, nice well equiped kitchen. Only drawback is the pool area, it's not big enough for the amount of guests, getting a sun lounger after 8am is near impossible."
197,321,Jul 13 2009 	Relaxing and Reliable	Stayed here for the third time in Vegas. Great getaway from the Strip even though it's right behind it! 5 minute walk to MGM and the Strip. Very clean quiet and relaxing resort. Bonus free breakfast and free drinks from 5-7pm to relax by the pool with. Free wi-fi unlike the Strip resorts that charge.Great for families wanting to get away from the casino's. Front desk staff is very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
198,321,"Jul 13 2009 	Wonderful facility ~ absolutely loved it!	I just returned yesterday from a four-night stay. My friend and I wanted personal privacy and yet an area to socialize and relax upon our return to our room. The two-bedroom, two-bath suite was perfect for our needs. I was impressed from the first moment of my arrival: everyone was courteous, efficient, and helpful. Our rooms were exceptionally clean and well-appointed. It was such a pleasure to have a full kitchen with all necessary items readily available. I have already started to plan my next trip with my daughter, her husband, and our two granddaughters. My only regret is that it looks as if we will have to wait until the spring. Thank you to everyone there for a great time!"
199,321,"Jul 13 2009 	Great trip.	Location is one block off the strip away from some of the hustle and bustle. Easy walk to all the casinos on the southern strip. Staff was great, concierge was very helpful. Room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. Free continental breakfast was great to help save a few dollars in Vegas."
200,321,"Jul 13 2009 	great price better stay	the staff was friendly, service was great, i will be back and would recommend this place to all my family and friends. It is close to the strip to walk to, but far enough to enjoy peace and quiet."
201,321,Jul 10 2009 	Great place to stay	We was very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of this resort. There was a great pool and the breakfast was very enjoyable. The hotel staff was very accomodating and the service was great. We was only a short distance from all the action of the srtip but was still very quiet. I would definately recommend this resort to anyone. Sincerely Mrs Angie Lewis
202,321,"Jul 9 2009 	best value in las vegas	This is a great place to stay, close to the strip but away from the madness. The only problem I had with them is that they were out of milk on Sunday and some breakfast items on Monday. The staff is very friendly and helpful, particularly the concierge. Other than that I would recommend them to anyone coming to Las Vegas."
203,321,"Jul 9 2009 	BEST Family Friendly Resort	We are SVC owners and loved our first stay with our points!! This place is unlike the Vegas hotels that are not family friendly in terms of smoking, gambling, night life but has all the amenities of a Vegas hotel on the strip and more: pool, spa, fitness center, free breakfast, laundry, BBQ grills (we grilled), full kitchens (we cooked), comfortable beds, nice furniture, great view from our unit, free wine/cheese evenings, nice/helpful staff, clean unit, well kept grounds, and is walking distance to all the glitz of Vegas if that's what you're into. As a mother of two teens I was impressed I could have it ALL in Vegas at this hotel, on a busy holiday weekend!!"
204,321,Jul 9 2009 	Great room for the price	We stay at the Desert Rose on the 17th of June for a week and I really can't say a bad thing about the place. a full kitchen and living room and nice bedroom with a comfortable bed. The only down side we found were. The bathroom was a bit small and the view of outside. we got a room on the ground floor facing what looked like a laundry room. We did try the breakfast on the first day and weren't impressed. It is free but unless you just fancy cereal and a tea/coffee its not really worth a visit. For the price and what you get i doubt you can do better that close to the strip.
205,321,"Jul 9 2009 	Excellent	Just returned,Hotel was excellent from fast check in,arrived just after 1pm and started to unpack in our room within 10 mins,breakfast was free and excellent,bagels,toast,ham egg and cheese,with plenty of fresh juice.Did tend to get busy round about 8am ish.However did not seem to be a big problem, Plenty of towels and beds available arounf the pool most days,there were odd days when most of the beds,were gone by 10am. Felt safe going and returning from strip at night,always turned right from the front door heading towards hooters/mgm,crossing at the end of the road to MGM front lobby.Happy hour 5-7 Monday to Friday,free beer and wine with small nibblesStaff were friendly and always greeted you with a hello and a smile.taxi from airport $13 no tunnel !, $10.50 return?taxi from Freemont $21taxi from Stratosphere hotel $19Why go anywhere else?"
206,321,"Jul 8 2009 	Perfect	This place was perfect for the 5 of us. We had 3 children with us; ages 12, 14, and 18. We had lots of space. It was really nice to have the full kitchen. The kids enjoyed swimming every day. The free breakfast was a good start to the day. We had 3 tvs so when relaxing in the hotel, we could have 3 different channels on. My husband and I checked our work email every day from our room using the free Internet access. The location was convenient to all the places we went to. Our room was clean and the staff was friendly. The parking was close to our room. This was our first stay at Desert Rose and we would definitely stay there again if we go back to Las Vegas."
207,321,"Jul 8 2009 	Surprisingly Affordable for First Class Quality	I was impressed first of all, by the appearance of the resort - very clean and well taken care of. Following that, every step of the way, we were more and more impressed. Check in was a breeze, no waiting and friendly, cheerful reservation clerks.Parking excellent and close to our room. The room was top class - furniture was comfortable and fashionable. The pool was awesome. Always had plenty of towels at the pool side, plenty of lounge chairs and tables.The continental breakfast was on time - just what you needed in the morning if you didnt feel like cooking or heading out to a gi-normous buffet.The entire staff we came into contact with were outstanding from the front receptionist, the maintenance staff to the housekeeping staff.The walking distance to the strip seemed like a &quot;hop, skip and a jump&quot; and we were very very happy that it was so close.The price of the room was phenomenal! I could go on and on. Needless to say, we will be telling everyone about the Desert Rose and we definitely plan to come back in the future."
208,321,"Jul 6 2009 	Gem in the Desert	Desert Rose Inn &amp; Resort - was by far the nicest hotel I've every stayed in! It's about 2 blocks off the strip and they are like mini apartments. They have a fully stocked kitchen, dining room, bedroom, bathroom, private balcony, pool, hot tub. The maid even does your dishes. The staff is very friendly and the grounds &amp; rooms are clean. You can hit the strip in the morning and go to the pool in the afternoon and then go out on the town at night. Very nice hotel - would recommend to my friends."
209,321,"Jul 6 2009 	Quiet clean good value  off strip	Desert Rose is an excellent value Shell Vacations Club hotel resort. Have stayed there twice in the last few years. This trip was even better than the first. Rooms clean and quiet. However, the breakfast was boring - same food everyday for 8 days. The pool was nice but people tended to set up camp in the lounge chairs early and never leave all day. But convenient walking distance location next to Hooters and MGM and monorail."
210,321,Jul 6 2009 	loved it!!!	ive just got back from a weeks stay at the desert rose las vegas and i loved it. the rooms were big and had everything u needed in there plus more. good location within minutes walk to the strip. it is nice to get out of the madness of the strip this is perfect!! done a trip through the hotel which was very good. hotel staff were very happy to help with everything.very good vale for money would stay here again
211,321,"Jul 6 2009 	A winner!	A perfect way to &quot;win&quot; in Las Vegas! No gaming on site, but close enough that you can play a little to popular casinos. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were clean- loved the individual balcony."
212,321,"Jul 6 2009 	This place was the best hotel we styed in during our entirre month long trip! Extremely impressive!	Desert Rose is a 5 minute walk from MGM Grand which means you get the advantage of being close to the strip and avoid the disadvantages of staying on it. The entire resort is spotless and the room cleaning staff even did our dishes for us. The room was massive, with a double room, dining area,open plan living room, fully fitted modern kitchen, walk in wardrobe, dress area, bathroom and balcony. It also had free wi-fi throughout the whole complex.The staff were extremely friendly and the free breakfast was the most comprehensive continental breakfast we had during our trip - (bagels, ham, eggs, muffins, bananas, toast, yoghurt and cerals). On the weekdays they provided free, yes completely free, wine and beer between 5-7pm along with snacks, like nachos, tacos etc. The pool was a good size and very clean. Although we didn't use the fitness studio it was very well equipped and as with everything on the complex, spotlessly clean. I really don't have enough superlatives at hand to describe how great we thought this hotel was and for the price it is a real find ($370 for 5 nights).We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and were disappointed we had to leave to go to another hotel (Riviera) to meet up with family - we spent the entire time at the Riviera reminiscing about the Desert Rose, especially since the Riviera was more expensive than the Desert Rose but not even half the quality. If you get the chance to book here do it, you will most definitely not regret it!"
213,321,"Jul 5 2009 	A wonderful week in Las Vegas/Desert Rose Resort	The Desert Rose Resort is part of the Shell Vacation Club of which we are owners and the management and staff of the resort made our weeks stay absolutely very comfertable relaxing and certainly felt like home away from home.The Resort is well situated within walking distance of the Strip and also handy to the MGM Studios Resort where the Monorail begins.The staff were very friendly and always willing to assist when necessary.We would recommend this resort to all ages and families. Thank you The Desert Rose, we will be back. John and Gail Sobota, Queensland Australia."
214,321,"Jul 5 2009 	Great Value	The room I booked was a 1 bd room. Living room was quite specious with a pull out sofa bed, the kitchen was well equipped, and the bed room had a nice king bed with good matress. Only thing is that the bathroom was very small. They do not do a very good job cleaning the rooms. I stayed a whole week and I had to call the front desk twice as they did not clean the room or they did not leave any towels. Over all experience of the hotel was good. Except for the issue with house keeping. Also, hot water was a problem. Great Value for your money! Loved the Happy Hour!"
215,321,"Jul 5 2009 	Family Friendly	Non gaming resort - good if you need to visit Vegas for reasons other than everybody else. Felt like Phoenix instead. No slot machines, no long lines at check in. Parked the car near our room. Super friendly and efficient staff. Even the cleaning folks have smiles and say hello when you pass them in the hall. We had a family reunion in Vegas - my father's 75th birthday. We appreciated the weekday happy hour because all fifteen of us could sit in the lobby and chat. Beer, chardonnay, merlot, and white zin - and plenty of it, along with snacks that ranged from peanuts and pretzels to lasagna. Their daily breakfast was good - bagels, toast, cereal, ham, hard boiled eggs - enough to fill your tummy. Convenient location. Can't say anything bad. Good job DRR."
216,321,Jul 4 2009 	Would return	Great place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast and evening drinks reception are good. Nice to get away from hustle and bustle of the strip.
217,321,"Jul 2 2009 	A Wonderful Stay	We would not stay anywhere eles but Desert Rose, it's a home away from home.Thanks to the staff and the wonderful services they provide."
218,321,"Jun 30 2009 	Very clean comfortable spacious hotel!	As a family of 5 we found this hotel to be very easy to settle into. We stayed in the two bedroom, 2 bathroom suite and it was very spacious. The bedrooms were very clean, and the beds comfortable! The bathrooms as well were very clean. There was a small kitchen with microwave, and refrigerator which were both very handy. The complimentary breakfast was always well stocked throughout the morning. It was nice to be about an easy two block walk to the strip, and be away from all the noise at night.. It was our first visit to Vegas from Pennsylvania, and I would definetly recommend this hotel to family and friends!"
219,321,"Jun 29 2009 	An Oasis	I enjoyed my stay at the Desert Rose. This was my first visit. I usually stay at a casino hotel but this was so much nicer...breakfast every morning, a wonderful suite, very quiet. Truly an oasis right off the strip!"
220,321,"Jun 29 2009	Great place to stay	I stayed here for medical reasons for two weeks, it was close to my doctors office. The rooms are large and spacious and clean. Maid service was good, except they only vacumed when i asked and they never mopped, although when i asked the front desk they said they vacuum daily, which they did not! We had an issue with our garbage disposal, and for some reason they wanted to be cheap and not hire a plumber so it kept breaking and it was an inconvienience, it never was fixed which was a pain, esp since we cooked most days to save money. If you are traveling for pleasure this place is close enough to the strip you can enjoy the Vegas Strip life, but far enough away to have peace and quiet. The pool is nice, but small and the chairs fill up quickly. The morning breakfast is nice, and so is the afternoon receptions. They have two really nice grills (natural gas) by the pool you can use too, they were popular when i was there...got lots of use. The balcony makes a nice touch, nice to sit outside and enjoy some fresh air, can't really do that with the big strip rooms.Overall great place to stay, would recommend and would return if needed...The one complaint, i wish they had a door on the bathroom sink area, it was a pain if you needed to do something and someone was sleeping."
221,321,"Jun 29 2009 	Perfect - would definitely go back	This is the second year in a row that I have chosen to stay at this resort. My father lives in Vegas and so the visit is necessary. Last year, I ended up spending a lot of time in the hotel as I had pneumonia most of the holiday and can attest to the comfort of the room. This year was less dramatic, but the room was clean, well-appointed and the customer service was excellent. Staff were very helpful in assisting me with a family emergency. This will continue to be my home away from home on any future visits to Vegas."
222,321,"Jun 27 2009 	Disappointing in the little things	Room was great: clean, large and comfortable. I stayed for four nights and the maid service was good. Now for the less pleasant bits: there were multiple exterior doors whose locks did not regularly work with the room key. It was a pain to have to walk longer distances late at night to find an exterior door that worked. Same problem with the laundry room. This problem was worse because parking lots were chained off at night, limiting the ways in to the facility after 10 pm. The morning breakfast service was always quite crowded but they did at least spread out the serving tables so the crowded were dispersed."
223,321,"Jun 26 2009 	Very good hotel	We stayed 4 nights at the hotel. It was really comfortable and we were fully satisfied with all our needs. If we ever come back to Vegas, we will definitely stay there again!"
224,321,"Jun 26 2009 	Great Resort for families with small kids	Great hotel with a condo feel. Perfect for families with kids - just off the strip and NO casino. We loved that we were close to everything but did not have to constantly walk our kids through a casino to get to our room. Our room was great, bed very comfortable and loved having a full kitchen. Continental Breakfast was good and Manager's Reception a nice break before dinner. Kids loved the pool and also the small kiddie pool."
225,321,Jun 24 2009 	What More Could You Ask For! Comfortable and Close to Everything!	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 3 nights while at a wedding in Vegas. We SAVED so much money because of the kitchen and the place was so comfortable. The breakfast was very nice. The staff was exceptional. Do not think twice about this resort. If you have the opportunity to stay here than do it. It was the best stay I ever had in Vegas. Will definitely book here again.
226,321,"Jun 24 2009 	Comfortable 	Resort is close to the strip yet far enough to be peaceful. The room felt very clean and modern. The layout of the one bedroom we stayed in was less than ideal with children along (a teen and a 20 year old); in order to access the bathroom, one had to go through the bedroom. Not a major concern, but privacy may be an issue."
227,321,"Jun 24 2009 	The least sparkling hotel in Las Vegas but the best gem!	The reception desk was OK, there was no one to help us with our bags and show us to our room, but I can live with that. The location of this hotel is absolutely fantastic - a 10 minute drive from the airport, and a short walk to MGM Grand, Tropicana and the main hotels on the strip. The room itself was large, with a living room with TV, bedroom, bath/shower, fully equipped kitchen, and a dining room and balcony. Totally excellent, as I'm sure all the other guests and comments on here will agree!The hotel is great. We didn't have much to do with the staff but they seemed OK and friendly. The only two critisisms I can find are the rather chaotic breakfast area and the rather small pool where it was difficult to find a sun lounger after 9am. But then you don't come to Vegas for bland muffins and a small pool do you?!"
228,321,"Jun 23 2009	Comfortable convenient good value	This non-gambling, family friendly, hotel was a pleasure to stay at. The hotel suite apartment was a plus. The more than adequate breakfast was very appreciated since we had an early departure. Our group enjoyed the happy hour, pool and hot tub after a log day of traveling. The location was close enough to the strip that we could have dinner and walk down Las Vegas Blvd. When we return to Las Vegas we will certainly give the Desert Rose serious consideration."
229,321,"Jun 23 2009 	Awesome Stay	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Desert Rose Resort and had a wonderful time. Its only a block of the strip, so you get to enjoy the lights without the noise. It perfect for saving money on meals (dining on the strip can be expensive) with the kitchen thats included in every suite; plus there's a continental breakfast and happy hour. The bed was super comfortable and very private. I will be staying here again."
230,321,"Jun 23 2009 	Loved it!	Everyone that was working was friendly.We LOVED cocktail hour.The pool was always at a satisfactory temperature.There was not a bus stop on/near our road. We had to walk to Excalibur, Luxor, or MGM. About a 10 min walk.We will definitely stay there every time we go back!"
231,321,"Jun 22 2009 	Perfect family environment!!	This was our second time staying at the Desert Rose in Las Vegas. It is a perfect wonderful resort for families. As long as you aren't concerned about staying in a casino, this is the place to be. You just walk across the street right into the MGM. I really enjoy it here because it is off the beaten path, yet walking distance onto the strip. I would recommend this resort to anyone. I do have one question though, where do you get those WONDERFUL white down like comforters with the white trim around them?? I would really like to find out to see if I could get one."
232,321,Jun 20 2009 	The Desert Rose Resort was perfect for us.	The Desert Rose has a friendly efficient staff. It is a nice place within walking/bus distance of major gambling establishments. In addition it serves a good continental breakfast and has a nice wine/appetizers reception in the early evening. I will definitely stay here again.
233,321,"Jun 19 2009 	spacious condos	We have stayed at the Desert Rose quite a few times and it is great value for money - love the breakfast, its plentiful for anyone. The rooms are spacious and there is everything a family/couple could need and more besides - fridge/freezer microwave etc, its home from home...perhaps if you were to look for something to moan about then it would be that the carpets need cleaning, and possibly up-grade the settees now, but i think they are starting to do that already....if you have a family and need a clean homely place to stay, then this is it..accessable for the strip and anything else you may wish to do in the fun city."
234,321,Jun 18 2009 	Great place to stay!	It's a home away from home. Quiet &amp; relaxing. Staff was very helpful. Comfortable beds. Worth every penny. Will definitely go back when visiting Vegas.
235,321,"Jun 18 2009 	totally fabolous!	This was my second time staying at the Desert Rose in Las Vegas and just like the first stay it was absolutely fabolous! I love that it's off the strip but within walking distance of some of the major casinos. I love that they have happy hour (mon-friday), and breakfast at the resort. I love that the rooms are always clean and comfy and quiet. The staff is very friendly and wanted to make sure our stay was enjoyable. I can't say too many nice things about the resort. I actually just booked another reservation at this resort for a group of friends of mine at the end of the summer and I can't wait to return to the Desert Rose!"
236,321,"Jun 18 2009 	What a Nice Resort	Not your typical casino resort...clean, friendly staff, nicely laid out and decorated...quite a bit different than typical hotels in Las Vegas...no bar or casino, which I appreciated very much...convient parking"
237,321,"Jun 18 2009 	Desert Rose Resort	We stayed Jun.6th,2009 for two nights the resort was very nice. Grounds well keep. Pool clean. Rooms were very nice and clean.No need to go out and eat stove, dishes, pots, pans,refrigerator, a mini suite, dishwasher, microwave just like home. Breakfast had a lot to choose from as well .Would recommend this resort as a &quot;A&quot; for the staff and the reasons above."
238,321,"Jun 18 2009 	Nothing but nice things to say	We stayed at the Desert Rose last week for 4 nights. I have nothing but nice things to say about it. We were in a one bedroom and had our two 18 year old daughters with us. The pool was nice (we were there right when it opened so no problems finding chairs), my husband used the exercise facility, breakfast was good (we were up early so not that crowded), attended the afternoon &quot;happy hour&quot; drinks and snacks (nice), used the concierge service to get tickets to tPhantom of the Opera and she was GREAT help! Rooms were nice and one daughter kept asking if we could just stay. Even with walking to Hooters to catch a taxi, my feet said we had to go home. Thanks for making it a special week."
239,321,"Jun 18 2009 	A quiet comfortable complex only 10-15minutes walk from the strip	My partner and I had a very comfortable 6 night stay at the Desert Rose Resort back in March 09. We had a one bedroom self -contained apartment which was very clean, quiet , well equipped and maintained by management. It was only a 10-15 minute walk to the MGM Grand where you could easily pick up the Deuce (consider at least 24 hr bus ticket if not a 3 day ticket as works out a lot cheaper) and begin your day hopping on and off the bus and exploring the strip at your leisure. There is a Vonns Supermarket just a few blocks east along Tropicana Av and we were able to use our Deuce bus ticket to travel there and stock up on groceries as the kitchen in the apartment was excellent and a great way on saving money on eating out all the time. The resort offered a complimentary breakfast every morning which had a good choice of breakfast items and their free wine hour during the week was a welcome relief for tired feet. We would definitely stay there again."
240,321,"Jun 17 2009 	Wonderful Stay	The room was great, the staff very helpful, the location was great! We drove so the free parking was a bonus! We took advantage of the continental breakfast and the pool."
241,321,"Jun 16 2009 	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 5 nights	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 5 nights. The location is great, a short walk to the MGM Grand and monorail station and a 3-block walk to hotels on the Strip. Parking is free and conveniently located right in front of the building. It has fast check-in without the crowds at other hotels. The rooms are big: separate living room with sofa, TV, kitchen table, kitchen with everything you need (microwave, oven, cooktop, toaster, blender, coffee maker, large refridgerator and all the silverware and china you need), bedroom with another TV, bathroom with separate bathtub and toilet. Also every room has a balcony with 2 chairs.Our room on the second floor was quiet. The AC is noisy when it comes on but it is located in the living room and does not make as much noise in the bedroom. The staff is very friendly, hard-working, and they are trying their best during the busy breakfast time. Breakfast includes bread, bagels, packaged pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, cold cuts, boiled eggs, oatmeal, juices, milk, coffee and tea. Breakfast is very crowded. One suggestion would be to expand breakfast hours until 10 am for the late night gamblers and to ease the congestion in the morning. One negative point, the birds have learned about breakfast too and sitting outside means watching your food very carefully.On weekdays evening there is a reception with free wine and beer, various snacks like chips and salsa and something warm, like eggrolls, tacos, etc. In the lobby area there is always free Starbucks coffee.The staff is very friendly, the rooms and grounds are clean, all non-smoking, the area feels secure and quiet. WIreless internet worked great, fast and reliable. There is a small fitness center which is sufficiently equipped. The pool area has a BBQ for grilling your own food. The pool is on the smaller site and often crowded. There is also a mini convenience store onsite and directions to nearby grocery stores."
242,321,"Jun 15 2009 	Made for the perfect vacation	There are no words to express how wonderful our experience at this hotel was. We had a hard time finding a hotel that could accomodate our large family in Vegas, when we came across the web site for this hotel we were thrilled to find a suite that would accomodate our needs. Everything from making the reservation, to finding it, to check in was easy and pleasant. The staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful during our entire stay. For a large family on a tight budget there truly could not be a better place in Vegas to stay. We were pleased with the location- it makes getting around Vegas quite simple. While we did not take part in the activities (due to other family obligations) we were pleased to see the number of things this hotel offers. We feel that your web site does not due this hotel justice!! We have family that lives in Vegas so we will be back and we will definately be staying at The Desert Rose Resort!!!"
243,321,"Jun 14 2009 	Best suite on strip for the cost	Stayed here this past week after reading such good reviews on this site- we were very pleased with the room, location, comfy bed, fully stocked kitchen, nice hot tub, free beer on wk days, view of the strip, walking distance to Hooter's pool, and easy access to and from everywhere else. It has so many positives... we will stay here again if given the chance.However it is true that this property is a long walk to the main strip- you can see MGM from here but walking to it is a LONG stroll. And there's lots of traffic so it's better to walk to Hooters, then Tropicana.. and so on. It's also true that the air conditioners are loud but they work incredibly well... so didn't bother us. The last and only other non-positive thing is that because it's not on the strip some clubs will not offer you the complimentary pickup. And taxis seem to like to take the long way back here... so rent a car for heaven's sake. This place is awesome and the only place to stay if you're not wanting to buy a timeshare or pay waaaay too much. Enjoy it!"
244,321,"Jun 10 2009 	Great stay with variety of family	We picked this facility due to the proximity of wedding and convenience to strip - no previous knowledge of what to expect, though I was impressed with reviews I read on this site. We had 5 rooms and they were all nice, clean and comfortable. We had folks from their 70's down to teens and eveyone enjoyed it. Staff very friendly. Very, very easy to get to strip and monorail. Complimentary breakfast was nice with variety. We were glad we got to pool early on nice sunny day as and chairs and lounges filled up quickly. Overall rooms very much quieter than at higher end hotels - very little noise, though our nephew was next to an outside entrance and he did say he could hear the door close as it &quot;slammed&quot; with spring action to make sure it latched. We were in room right next to him and never heard a thing. We will stay here again on future visits to Vegas and look for Shell Hospitality Resorts during future travel"
245,321,"Jun 9 2009 	Still waiting for charges to be reversed on card.	Stayed for one night at the Desert Rose. The room was spacious, although the carpet was filthy. Beyond dirty to filthy. Beds were comfortable and clean. We booked a two bedroom, two bath suite. I did not realize one bathroom had a shower only; no tub. Wi-fi was spotty. Fairly short walk to strip, but very dark and unlit at night. We had prepaid for our room through a travel site and had no problem giving them a credit card on check in for &quot;incidentals&quot; (which we knew we would have none), but four days after checkout I'm still waiting for the deposit to be reversed on my card. The deposit was almost as much as our room charge (within a few dollars). Really? For a prepaid room for one night's reservation? Perhaps they could have mentioned the amount they would be holding up front. Did not realize they had a concierge..... all we ever saw was one woman working the front desk. As a side note, if you are looking for peace and quiet, keep looking. I think a lot of families with small children stay at this resort, and you can hear EVERYTHING through the walls and ceilings. At least, we certainly could. It even kept my teenage son awake!"
246,321,"Jun 8 2009 	Would have paid alot more for such a fine place to stay	Me and my husband stayed here for 5 nights and I was just floored when we walked into the room for the first time. I had booked this hotel based on other travelers reviews I had read but the room surpassed everything I had expected. Wonderful, CLEAN, two room suite with a full kitchen tastefully decorated, everything in working order. Patio area. granite countertops. Bed was comfy and our room was cleaned daily. Even the day we didn't leave our room until late I was phoned by housekeeping to see if there was anything we needed. Wonderful service. Two blocks behind the strip. Located behind Hooters and Tropicana. Wonderful location."
247,321,"Jun 5 2009 	Great location and service - Loud AC	The DR was a great place. The rooms were clean and spacious, the breakfast great, the staff very helpful. My only complaint was a crazy loud AC, which was a bit disturbing at night while sleeping...but still, I have a great time and it was close to everything."
248,321,"Jun 4 2009 	Best Place Close to the Strip	If you are looking for a quiet place to enjoy your time in fabulous Vegas look no further. We stayed in a roomy one bedroom with full kitchen (all cooking necessities included). Staff were curteous and friendly. Room was clean, although it could use a couple of paint touch ups. Free continental breakfast. Free weekday social in lobby from 5:00 to 6:00 (included wine, beer and snacks). Short walk to Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Tropicana, MGM and New York New York. Found great deal online at hotel website. Desert Rose is truly that, a rose in the desert."
249,321,"Jun 4 2009 	Great...BUT...light sleepers beware!	I would have given the Desert Rose Resort a 5 star rating except for the fact that we had to be re-roomed because of the noisey compressors on the roof. Warning....the 3rd floor is noisy. Every time the AC cycled on, it sounded like a freight train was passing thru our room! Luckily, the staff at the DR is soooo accommodating, that they moved us right away.Other than that, I have nothing but praise for the DR. Great rooms, great value, great location. Breakfast is wonderful, but CROWDED! I agree with other reviewers...rent a car, we did and were soooo glad we did. Also, if you plan to win, visit the downtown casinos. The odds there are much better. (Video poker)"
250,321,"Jun 4 2009 	Why stay anywhere else in Las Vegas?	Brilliant place this - with a vast suite (not just a hotel room and bathroom - a large lounge /diner, next to the well equipped kitchen, large bedroom with wash basin off and bathroom), great pool (with free beds and towels at the pool side), breakfast and (from Mon - Fri) free beer and wine served for a couple of hours in the evening. This together with :-- friendly, efficient, staff- good location (very close to the MGM Grand)- great ratesmakes this a fantastic bargain - it could not be recommended more highlyThank you Desert Rose."
251,321,"Jun 4 2009 	You can't go wrong for the convenience and value	Spent a long R&amp;R weekend and was soooooo pleased with the room, staff, appointments in the room, pool. I recommend you rent a car to get around the Strip unless you are athletic and a glutton for punishment. The convenience of stocking your kitchen for easy eats was a great plus. Fridge makes Ice. Wi-FI in room free. It is a class act with a great bang for your buck."
252,321,"Jun 3 2009	Better than the Casinos	Two bedrooms, two baths, and a large living area, a full kitchen and dining area for $102/night. Six or more people could have slept in our apartment.. There was free wifi. The wifi service was a bit spotty though, it would drop then reacquire the signal several times per session. The free continental breakfast, was more than adequate, cold cuts,fresh fruit, bread, bagels, boiled eggs, milk, cold, and cereal. The choices vary from day to day. Good service and clean. It is in a good location near the strip but out of the hustle and bustle, an easy walk to the strip near Hooters,The Tropicana and MGM. It is a good base for &quot;doing Vegas&quot;. Parking is free, well lit, and convenient. The only two negatives. You should get to the pool early to get a deck chair and the equipment in the fitness room is not in good condition. We had stayed at several of the Casinos in the past but never again."
253,321,Jun 3 2009 	A Sweet Suite!	Everything from the room to the service was fantastic. The concierge were very polite and outstanding. We stayed in a 2-bedroom 2-bathroom suite and were amazed at how much space there was. I fell in love with it! The suite was filled with gorgeous decor and the kitchen was stocked with everything you could think of! The beds were also extremely comfortable. This resort is a rare gem as it is one of the most affordable suites to stay in that is extremely close to the strip. It's only a block away from the strip! It's right across from the MGM Grand within close range of New York New York and Excalibur. Staying at the Desert Rose Resort was very affordable and convenient. We didn't want to leave! We will definitely be back this year and for our other future trips. You can't go wrong with this one!
254,321,"Jun 3 2009 	great place to stay	this was our first time in las vegas and we were very lucky on finding a nice place like this 2 stay, it's clean comfortable, very affordable, staff are very welcoming and helpful, the managments free drink reception every evening was great and the breakfast had something for everyone, i will be stayin here on our next visit without a doubt."
255,321,"Jun 3 2009 	a true gem of a hotel amongst the chaos of las vegas	we stayed here for 4 nights and chose it as the main strip hotels were much more expensive. you would need a satnav to find your way from your rooom to reception in some strip hotels, they are more like little cities. the desert rose is only a 5 minute walk from the south end of the strip, we could see the luxor pyramid from our room. the room was more a self-catering apartment rather than a hotel room, with full kitchen facilities, a balcony area, and a separate living room. the breakfast was help yourself continental style, plenty of choice. the desert rose is smaller than most vegas hotels, this only added to its charm. all the staff were friendly and the room was spotless. i would recommend it to anyone who wants more than a basic hotel room and is happy to walk 5 minutes to the strip to join in all that vegas has on offer. if we return to vegas, i would not stay anywhere else."
256,321,Jun 2 2009 	Perfect location...great stay	We just returned today from the Desert Rose. I would stay there again in a minute. We booked a room through their website for a 2 bedroom for $101.00 per night for a Fri/Sat/Sun night. The location was great. Use the back roads to get to Mandalay Bay in 2 minutes. The managers reception on Friday night was great. Unlimited wine and beer. Nothing better than sitting by the pool drinking drinking for free. The free breakfast offered quite a few options for a contintenal breakfast. Something for everyone.Couple of odd things...there were no trash cans in the bedrooms and no clock in the 2nd bedroom. Obviously not a big deal. The other thing I would suggest is to stay in a building not directly next to Hooters. On Friday night they have live music outside and it was loud in the bedrooms. It was a great stay and I would highly recommend it.
257,321,Jun 1 2009 	Would not stay anywhere else when in Las Vegas.	The staff was courteous. The room was very clean with all of the amenities of home. The location was easy to get in and out of. Was close to the airport and the Las Vegas Strip. What I did like the best was it being quiet and a non-smoking resort. I can honestly say it was a pleasure to stay there.
258,321,"Jun 1 2009 	Great Experience	The Desert Rose Resort was everything that was promised. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas including MGM, Venetian, Luxor and Mandalay Bay, and those are great, but if you want a place with a good location, plus all the amenities for an extended stay the Desert Rose it is!!! The king bed was comfortable and the kitchen had everything you will need to cook and eat. You don't really need to plan on breakfast though because they have a nice light buffett every morning. Nice pool and workout facility too.I had a great experience and would highly recommend it."
259,321,Jun 1 2009 	home away from home	me and my family had stayed in LA and san diego hotels before we ended up in desert rose which we found very decent and good place to stay especially if you are travelling with little kids.its almost like my own home we had a wonderful time and whenever we go to vegas we definitely stay there.we loved it loved it and loved it
260,321,"May 31 2009 	Amazing!!!! Dont think you would find better unless you are prepared to spend $500.00 per night	We booked this resort on the advice given by other posts on tripadvisor, and I would have to agree with them all. This is a little gem amongst a pile of rubble. Do yourself a favour and stay here. It is at the south end of the strip, within walking distance to the entire strip. The rooms are well furnished and very clean, beds very comfortable and a nice free breakfast to start your day. Check in, and out, was hassle free and we would stay here again without hesitation. Well done to all staff and management you are a credit to this establishment.Steve MathewsAustralia"
261,321,"May 29 2009 	An oasis in Vegas--excellent!	We stayed at the Desert Rose during Memorial Day weekend. All of Vegas was packed with people, so we were happy to have found a great deal on the price. When we go there we were told that we were upgraded to a 2 BR suite for no extra charge! (we had reserved a 1 BR) That was great news because we had some friends joining us for one night &amp; now they didn't have to stay on the pull out! The room was incredible. It was facing the pool which allowed us to check how crowded it was before we went down there. The sitting area was large &amp; spacious, there was a separate area for dining, a large kitchenette and both rooms had their own bathrooms. We were very excited to have found this place.  The other great news: free breakfast. Not only was their breakfast free, it was quite a lot of food: boiled eggs, ham/turkey cold cuts, breads, fruit, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, juice, and more. It does get pretty crowed, so we went early &amp; carried some back to our room. We also saved some in our fridge to make sandwiches later. It was a great deal.  I suppose one of our favorite things about the Desert Rose was that it was quiet and had no gambling. After walking through all the smokey, loud casinos all day with tons of people it was so relaxing to return to a place that was removed from all of that commotion. That's why we call it the oasis of Vegas. If you like staying amidst all the commotion, this may not be the place for you, but it is very close to MGM grand--an easy 5 or 10 minute walk--so you can get all the glitz and return to the stress-free Desert Rose. Also, from what my friends at the MGM told us, they had to wait about 30 minutes to check in &amp; check out and using the elevators was always a chore. They had to go to the top floor just to get on an elevator to go down! We never had any trouble with the crowds or getting what we needed from the staff.  We had great service from the concierge, front desk and all the staff. I would definitely recommend this to people with kids or anyone who likes to relax while on vacation. A true find!"
262,321,"May 26 2009 	Cozy Clean Quiet Friendly right at the start of the STRIP!	This was our second stay at the Desert Rose and it was just as pleasant as the first time. Ideally located right across from the MGM Grand, the start of the Mono Rail and the start of the strip, so you are right where you want to be, but it is nice to come &quot;home&quot; to since it has no casino and is small scale. People are friendly and actually recognize you when you walk in and ever so helpful with everything. Although no luxury hotel, the 1 and 2 bedroom units are nicely decorated, everything you need is there (full kitchen), even free internet service and the beds are actually very comfortable. In the morning there is a nice complementary continental breakfast in the lobby area with Starbucks coffee (yep, free too), perfect to start your day and if you don't want to sit there, you just bring it to your room. Great value, will stay there again next time."
263,321,"May 26 2009 	What a find!	I am so glad I found this place! Thanks, TripAdvisor. We spent a week hiking in Zion and decided to spend 2 nights at the end of the trip in Vegas. My husband had never been to Vegas and wanted to explore the strip but I knew the big glitzy hotels were not for us. The Desert Rose Resort was perfect! I know a lot of people complained about the walking but I don't know how you can see Vegas without a lot of walking. To go into the Venetian and walk up and down the &quot;Grand Canal&quot; takes longer than it does to walk from the Desert Rose to the MGM. We had to return our rental car at the airport and didn't want to deal with our luggage so we arrived at the Desert Rose at 11:30am. Our room wasn't ready but they happily stored our luggage. We measured the distance to the car rental return (3.3 miles) and decided to walk back. (I told you we were hikers!) By the time we got back (after a stop at Mandalay Bay), the Desert Rose had called our cell phone to let us know that a room was ready. Great service!Our two room suite was spotless, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. There is a manager's reception during the week with beer, wine, soft drinks and snacks. The &quot;continental plus&quot; breakfast is decent and includes hard boiled eggs, which made me happy. There is Starbucks coffee available in the lobby 24 hours, I guess to keep you awake if you are out late gambling. :-)My only complaint is that the pool seemed very crowded but it was hot and all of the pools at the big hotels were crowded too. I don't think you can avoid that in Vegas in May. It was so nice to come back to the quiet of the Desert Rose after spending a day on the noisey, busy strip. We couldn't believe how long the lines were at check-in at some of the big hotels on the strip and how people had to walk through the casino with their luggage to find their rooms! No thank you! Give me the nice, personable Desert Rose any day.We plan to go hiking in Utah again and will probably fly in and out of Vegas again. When we do, we will definitely stay at the Desert Rose Resort."
264,321,"May 26 2009 	Large Nice Rooms for a fraction of the price	I am never staying on the strip again. I've been to Vegas several times and really enjoyed my stay at the Desert Rose. You are secluded from the loud obnoxious crowd on the strip for sleeping and relaxing at the pool, but can be right in the middle of it within a short walk. Huge rooms for a fraction of the price."
265,321,"May 24 2009 	great place great location great value	We arrived around 12PM the 1 week before Memorial day. I realized that Check in was at 4pm, but the friendly staff at the front desk got me a room that was ready. We stayed at Building 4, 3rd floor in a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the side of Hooters Hotel. The suite was spacious with a kitchenette and a nice balcony. We used the kitchen a lot to reheat food and snacks. There are 2 TVs - good, although not flat screen. Everything, including the kitchen worked. The staff was friendly and they even printed out my boarding pass for me. I would recommend this place to my family and friends."
266,321,"May 24 2009 	Great place to stay for 2-5 people-- right on strip but comforts of home	My 2 adult friends and I were visiting Vegas for a leisure weekend and found this resort as an alternative to 3 separate hotel rooms. We had a 2 bedroom (plus sleeper-sofa that was comfortable) suite for a good price, incluging well equipped full kitchen and two full baths. The location is virtually across the street from MGM Resort and walkable to the strip including tram. My friend used and enjoyed the on-site gym and while we did not use the pool it looked inviting. The staff was friendly and eager to please and when we requested additional linen it arrived in minutes.Definitely would stay here again. I have a family of 5 and this would have been perfect for my wife and 3 kids last time we visited. Seems family friendly and certainly safe location. Room was well equipped, beds were comfortable and everything seemed new."
267,321,"May 23 2009 	A very nice place to stay.	My husband and two children (ages 19 &amp; 21) and I stayed at this resort for 2 nights. I purchased the rooms from expedia for about $100 a night. It was worth it. It was clean. Nice rooms, actually we had two bedrooms, two baths, small living room/dining room and small kitchen. It suited our needs well. We could go to Walmart about 2 miles away and get food to eat in. To get to Walmart go out to Tropicana Blvd and make a right then go about 2 miles. The only negative thing was our room was right beside a locked gate and people were coming and going at all hours. The gate was noisy when it shut. I was glad that they had them though. You need your room key to open the gate. It was nice...it was clean....liked the kitchen... it had basic needs. The pull out couch was not comfortable but that was to be expected. Also, I read on here about the blocks out there being to long or big and they were right. Expect to do alot of walking."
268,321,"May 23 2009 	great place especially for family	My brothers and sister and I stayed here for 4 days and it was great-I would like to find more places like this in California and Hawaii,etc. Selma Gonzales"
269,321,"May 23 2009 	For wildlife lovers everywhere - if you like brown decor and noise.	I am actually staying at the Desert Rose at the moment, have been here for 6 nights as I am unable to shorten my stay without being charged for the full week.Not enjoying it one little bit so it's difficult to know where to start with my comments. Firstly I would like to warn anyone staying here of the telephone charges. I made three calls to the UK on the room phone for 3 mins 20 seconds, 3 mins 59 seconds and 4 mins 35 seconds - the charges for these calls were $53, $46 and $53 respectively. Obviously I'd expect a call from a hotel phone to be something like $10 for a few minutes but that is ridiculous. When I complained to the manager they simply had no explanation but agreed that their charges are 'extortionate'. Thanks guys.Secondly, the place is infested with moths. To a massive extent. I have just killed three of these in the last hour and they have plagued the week I have spent here. I have had them crawling on me, flapping in my ear while I was asleep, everywhere. Disgusting.Thirdly, there is a roach problem, although I have only caught 2 or 3 in my actual room, the corridors and outdoors are really bad and other guests have complained about their rooms being worse. And they're big ones too.Fourthly, although the place looks close to the big hotels when you look on a map or Google Earth, the walk is really terrible - the sewers in this block smell absolutely disgusting - to the extent that I wretched repeatedly, and there is no proper lighting. My girlfriend was approached in a car during the late afternoon and since there is virtually no one around the area and it backs onto the testosterone-fueled-moronic-whoop-fest which is Hooters Hotel it was a worry.Fifthly, forget about the pool. There are 144 large condos in this development. with I suppose an average of 3 people staying in each. There are approx 35 sunbeds. You do the maths, but even in Vegas people do like to use the pool and this one is woefully inadequate. It's not that great either. For the last four days we have been walking the mile or so to the Luxor to pay $10 to use their pool - didn't expect to have to do that but there is literally no choice.Sixthly, it's the noisiest place I've stayed since I last went to Ibiza aged 18.I didn't come to Vegas for the peace and quiet but when I put the do-not-disturb sign on the door (that incidentally says &quot;Shhhh... I'm sleeping&quot;) I don't really expect housekeeping to slam their trolleys relentlessly against the walls and constantly SHOUT at each other. That was really bad. Other guests were loud idiots too, but I'm not blaming that on the hotel (oh, okay, go on then I will).Finally, far be it for me to be a snob but the clientele that this place attracts are very hit and miss. The breakfast buffet is like feeding time at the zoo. I't's held right in the middle of the lobby, the food is shocking and in order to reduce costs (I guess) the management provide nowhere to eat properly, no trays and flimsy plastic plates. I saw someone with a bowl of bran flakes with a hard boiled egg balanced in the middle while they poured milk on them. Another elderly lady was perched on an easy chair in her nightdress, she had clearly walked directly from bed to the buffet bypassing every sink, hairbrush and item of everyday clothing. A pink nightie with no underwear, shoes or socks was just the ticket for her mealtime - and just the thing to put me off eating. I only went to the buffet once although I did get some jam on my clothes when I sat down in the lobby another day (does that count?).I'm a well travelled chap and I'm very reasonable and give credit where it's due. The hotel was good about calling taxis to get us from A to B. The concierge booked a nice restaurant for my birthday and generally the place is spacious. The staff were on the whole functional but not particularly friendly or exceptional.I'm quite reluctant to say this is a bad hotel, because I did a lot of homework before I booked this trip and virtually everywhere I looked said this place was great. But in all honestly it's not. It's pretty damn bad. And I hate to admit I picked the wrong place but I did.But please don't stay here unless you get a knock-out cheap rate. There are way better places to stay in Vegas and some hotels have real bargain rates at the moment. If you do stay here don't make any phone calls, don't expect to use the pool, enjoy your breakfast, have any peace and quiet or a pleasant stroll to the strip. And bring a nose clip unless you like the smell of sewage. Oh, and ear plugs to drown out the noise of the outdated air-con.Do bring a microscope because the bugs and crawlies could make excellent study projects for the kids."
270,321,"May 22 2009 	Hey I'm not easy to impress. This was a wonderful place to stay!	My daughter and I stayed 05/17 thru 05/21 of '09. Total for 4 nights (plus tax) was $533.96. Hey, I'm not easy to impress and am the first to complain if something isn't just right. But, for our time there at least, I have to say this was a wonderful place to stay. Maybe I didn't get a bargain basement price but I've paid a lot more for a lot less at other places. The top 10 reasons for staying at the Desert Rose ... or ... What we got for the money:1) A very clean 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, kitchen, dining area, living room and balcony. (Kitchen has fridge, microwave, dishes, utensils, blender, coffee pot, toaster, etc). The bed was possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. They even provided pillows of different sizes and fill just so you'd have a choice of what you'd like best to sleep with. I've never seen anyone else do that.  2) The baths had the deepest tubs I'd ever seen in a hotel. The shower had instant (and I mean INSTANT) hot water. I don't even get that at home!3) There were TV's in the living room and in each bedroom.4) The air conditioning was wonderful and there was no AC or 'hotel smell' (i.e. people or chemicals). The air was very clean. 4) Pool (we were too busy to ever use but saw others did and never heard a complaint)5) Very friendly and helpful staff. The only time I was ever 'bothered' was when the cleaning staff actually called on the phone once to ask if I was sure I didn't want the room cleaned even though I had posted a 'do not disturb' sign on the door so I could grab a nap. I wondered then if they would have ignored the posted note if I hadn't answered the phone. Hmmmm. 6) Continental breakfast (served until 9 AM) that was more than adequate (cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, deli ham, fruit, etc.) No, not the very best I've ever had but close and still nicer than what most places term a 'Continental breakfast' . Besides, do you really want to 'load up' or weigh yourself down before hitting the Vegas strip? Even if you have a car or are just going to use the monorail, there is still a lot of walking around involved with your seeing Vegas. 7) There was some sort of free drinks (cocktails?) and snacks thing in the afternoon (A Complimentary Manager's Reception was the official name) that we never attended but thought you should know about. 8) Free Wi-Fi. We never used it but mention it here anyway. 9) We never had a problem with noise at the hotel even though our room was one story above the parking lot. I never heard the people in the hall or in the rooms next to us - no voices, no footsteps, nothing.10) There is no gambling at the Desert Rose. Whew! Returning 'home' to the hotel each night after being inundated with the noises of machines and people, I really appreciated there not being a hint of it waiting for me when I was ready to rest up for the next day.Final note: I'm not a world traveler but have stayed in a lot of nice hotels the last half century. Some of them thought a lot better of themselves than I did. This one, though, was a real find. The hotel claims &quot;...this three-story, all-suites hotel is just one block from the Las Vegas Strip, yet miles away in ambience&quot;. That statement of what to expect is spot on. I regret not taking photos of the rooms to share. I meant to as the one's supplied by the hotel don't do it justice - don't even come close.Also, if you are staying in Vegas for a few days without a car, consider getting a multi-day pass for the monorail (around $25). We had 102 and 103 degree days during our stay, the monorail helped avoid a lot of walking in the heat (and I don't care who starts in about it being a 'dry heat'. A hair dryer is a dry heat. It doesn't help when you turn the setting on high and stick it in your face. It is still HOT, people!"
271,321,"May 21 2009 	REALLY GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!!!!	We Stayed AT The Desert Rose Resort For my husbans 40TH birthday. It was amazing, the staff was very helpful. The rooms were beyond anything we expected based on the price. We are planning another trip and we willstayiing at another DESERT ROSE RESORT. Cannot say enough about this place.! It is also wthin walking distance from the vagas strip and mintues from the airport. Perfect spot!"
272,321,"May 21 2009 	Best Place for Families	We've just returned from staying at the Desert Rose - May 13 - 19/09. We were travelling to Las Vegas for a wedding. Got a great rate by booking directly with the resort - $100/night for the large 2 bedroom suite.We travelled with 4 teenagers and stayed in a 2 bedroom with pull out sofa in Building 4. Size of the suite was fantastic and more than enough room for the 6 of us. Large master bedroom with full ensuite was great and having a well stocked kitchen helped keep our food costs down.After walking through many of the casinos on the strip, I was very happy to be staying at the Desert Rose. I can't imagine staying in one of the large hotels and having to trek your belongings 20 minutes to find your room.The pool was very nice and a good size. My husband had breakfast and his coffee poolside every morning and found it very relaxing. The teenagers loved jumping into the water after a long day of walking in the sun. And yes the pool is not heated, but being Canadian we didn't mind! A cool pool after walking in 37C temperatures is nice.Staff were ever helpful. The only complaint we had was every week day morning we could hear the either a delivery truck or garbage truck backing up. The beeping was very annoying. Other than that we had a very enjoyable time and would definite stay here again."
273,321,"May 21 2009 	Spacious and convenient great for longer stays	We chose this hotel rather than a Casino resort as it offered a 1 one bedroom suite and more space for 3 at a good price. 1 friend cancelled, so we were 2 women to the suite which turned out even better spacewise. It gave us more room for the large amount of clothing/shoes we brought. Also, the bathroom is rather small and off the Master bedroom, so people sleeping in the living room will have to walk through the bedroom. Luckily, sink and mirror are separate from the shower/toilet. Kitchen is really nicely equipped but the free (cold) breakfast was sufficient for us in the morning. It is nice to have a fridge to store leftovers and drinks, etc. The Pool area is clean and rather large but on most days there were not enough chairs and towels for all guests. The cocktail reception at 5pm is nice and filled us up until we got out for the night. The fitness room is smallish but has nice equipment. All staff is very helpful at all times. Generous parking for guests available if you rent a car (recommended if you want to go back to the hotel during the day to change or relax before nightlife, as commuting takes up a lot of time and its hot out there!). Walking distance to the Luxor is 8 minutes. From there you can catch a train (5 USD/trip). From the hotel, taxi cab to the airport is approx. 10 USD, so for 2 it is cheaper than the shuttle bus which has to be reserved 24 hours in advance. Supermarkets are approx. 2 miles away from the hotel in each direction - the nicer option here is a nicely designed strip mall (Town Square) with Whole Foods, upscale shopping and some good clubs/restaurants (Claim Jumper). Desert Rose is a nice, quite place if you dont need to be in the middle of constant party and action. Really good choice for longer stays. The guests are a mixed crowd, all ages, also some kids. The free WIFI in the room is also a nice bonus and allows to catch some good ticket deals for shows or other things do do in Las Vegas."
274,321,"May 21 2009 	Gave all that was promised.	First time to Vegas so had no expectations butt WOW!!!!!!! The Desert Rose was everything it had prmised it would be.Rooms enourmous, fully equipped for all your possible needs including spare bedding and towels. Breakfast was a bit caotic but items replaced as soon as they run out.Really good location and once you learn how to get into the MGM acroos from Hooters car park it does not take long to hit the other hotels on the strip.Execellent value for money compared to the bigger hotels. Didn't really attend many of the managers free drinks as usually not around at these times (free drinks and snacks Monday -Friday 5pm-7pm) but it would have been nice to have a bar within the hotel for a quiet drink before bed, but a short car journey down Tropicana ave takes you to Vans supermarket where we discovered some lovely Califorian wines to drink in our room.Would definaltly stay again and recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Vegas"
275,321,"May 18 2009 	Great place to stay a few days!	This was a really nice place to stay, just off the strip, with family."
276,321,"May 18 2009 	Desert it at all costs!	We booked into the Desert Rose for 4 nights from 18 April 2009 based on its reviews, proximity to the strip, kitchen and price. We were advised upon arrival at 9.40pm (I had emailed twice in advance advising of this) that the hotel had had a major plumbing problem that morning and many rooms were out of service and we would have to go to the Bluegreen resort just around the corner for the night. Interestingly we phoned from LA airport at 6.30pm just before our flight to check someone would be there when we arrived and no one mentioned anything then. Suspecting a rat, but too tired to keep arguing (following a 21 hour flight the day before from our home with a 7 and 9 year old in tow), we hopped in the taxi paid for by the hotel and off it drove and drove and drove. When we asked where we were going the taxi driver (bless this gorgeous man) pointed to some far away lights and indicated that the hotel was about half an hour walk from the strip past a huge and dangerous vacant lot. So he took us back to the Desert Rose. We said we were happy to shift to another hotel but it had to be equal or better (ie with 2 young children strip proximity was paramount). Nup, they couldnt do it. Their denial of my request to see the rooms with the plumbing problems confirmed what I suspected. After an hour of arguing - they picked the wrong jetlagged woman on the wrong night and I was ready to set up the lobby as our hotel room and put the kids to sleep on the couches  abracadabra there was suddenly a room available. Amazing. So when they try this low life trick on you I hope this story helps. Obviously we looked like total suckers  ie we paid a non-refundable rate in advance and being a busy weekend could there have been better offers on the table? We even handed back the $40 Hooters voucher we were given as I just felt sick looking at it.My advice to the hotel  lift your game in the choice of front desk managers  I doubt that the guy working on the night of the 18 April was what any hotel would want representing them. You can do far better than this. The room was nice, but we didnt use the kitchen as we couldnt figure out where a grocery store was (we didnt have a car) and didnt want to go near the front desk to ask during our stay. Vegas was great and the West Rim was fabulous."
277,321,"May 17 2009 	The best time ever!!	If you have a choice, stay at this hotel! The breakfast is fanatasic, the cocktail reception is wonderful, the staff is friendly!!! Hardly spent money on food - just snacks and dinner. Easy access to and from the hotel from the airport - Airport shuttle is only $6 each way (buy both tokens at once - makes it much easier) It's a block away from the strip - MGM is across the street so there's easy access to the monorail. I'm not much of a gambler, so not having a casino at the hotel worked out great from me. You dont have to worry about smelling like smoke all the time and the noise levels are low. The 1-bedroom suite I had was spacious and clean! The private balcony was great too! Full size kitchen with appliances (blender, toaster, full-size microwave, frig &amp; stove). A nice dinner table and chaise lounge. The bed was comfortable and big. The bathroom is a little small, but makes up for it by having a deep tub. I have been telling everyone since I've been back - this is the place to stay! I will never stay at a casino hotel again. The rooms are much cheaper for a better quality room! I have no complaints at all when it comes to the Desert Rose Resort"
278,321,"May 16 2009	Quiet relaxing place to stay close to strip	My boyfriend and I recently spent a week here. I recommend booking through them directly, as you might get a good deal (I checked other travel sites and felt booking through them was best and ended up paying almost half price for my room thanks to a special). There is a pool, free continental breakfast, free WiFi and Mon-Fri they have a little get together for guests and invite people to come down for drinks and snacks. I found employees to be helpful, although to help find the place quicker, it's good to note that this place is directly behind Hooters on a side street.We had a one bedroom with a fully equipped kitchen. How equipped? Go to a store nearby, buy some food and you can make meals right in your room. There's a dining area and living room area. The bedroom was nice with a big comfy bed, and the bathroom was nice too. Everything was wellstocked, clean and it made us feel like we were at home. I would stay here again in a heartbeat next time we take a trip to Las Vegas.And if you feel like gambling, shopping, eating out, clubbing, etc, you may not be able to do it here but you're close enough to the strip that you only need to go about 5 min to get to all the big casino resorts."
279,321,"May 15 2009 	An oasis amongst the madness of Vegas	If you want to stay close to the Vegas Strip but also want a sanctuary away from the noise and madness of the big casino hotels, the Desert Rose is a real find. Just one block away from New York New York it's quiet and peaceful, has large, very clean apartment style suites and a pleasant outdoor swimming pool and fitness room. Friendly staff too. And very god value for money. No restaurant (rooms have kitchens) but continental breakfast included. Highly recommended."
280,321,May 15 2009 	Truly a rose ----in a Sea of cactus	A place we have no problem recommending to our friends. All of are needs and desires were meet with a friendly staff waiting to please.
281,321,"May 15 2009 	Rose in the Desert	We just retuned from a week long trip to Las Vegas and stayed at the Desert Rose. We are owners of SVC in Barie, Canada, therefore exchnaged our week.Arrived late at night 11:30pm, but in our rooms by 11:45pm. Complimentary Bfast, Internet, happy hour in the evening are pleasant surprises. Room matched most of the SVC properties we stayed, well appointed. We did not have any problems staying at this resort. Will stay here if we go again to Las Vegas.Perfect location so close to the strip yet you could have your own peace and quiet if you choose."
282,321,"May 15 2009 	Great spot away from the glitz	We had a lovely time at the Desert Rose Resort in Vegas. It was fabulous for a family with youngish children, like us. It was clean, rooms nice but no wow factor, handy to the Strip and main attractions, had a lovely pool, good breakfast and nibbles at night and staff helpful (except concierge - she gave us poor information more than once). Would recommend this as a great place for families who want to experience Vegas without being amongst the glitz and hype."
283,321,"May 13 2009 	Good value for the money	Ceck-in, Check-out, services are fast and prompt. Continental breakfast, manager's snacks in the evening, room service, cleanliness of the property and pool side are excellent. Apartment is with fully equiped kitchen. Laundry services are cheap and good.Though the facility is just off the 'Strip' it has all the convenience of staying on the 'Strip'. However the atmosphere is serene and pleasant."
284,321,"May 13 2009 	Great resort wonderful experience	Accommodations are very nice, their complimentary breakfast and cockail hour are first class. Their complimentary internet access is an unusual treat as well. Location is great, within walking distance of the Strip."
285,321,"May 12 2009 	Quiet nice cheap friendly people centrally located. What more do you want!	We didn't expect much from this hotel, since we stayed in the Venetian at the start of our vacation. But everything exceeded our expectations: rooms were HUGE, you had your own kitchen, everything was nice and clean, everybody friendly, breakfast complementary, nice pool, very quiet and just off the strip. It was a pity we only had one night here before flying back home!"
286,321,"May 12 2009 	Great Value	We picked the Desert Rose after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed. The staff were friendly; the rooms were very clean, well equipped and had plenty of space; the location was ideal - just a couple of minutes walk from the strip; and it was excellent value for money. We didn't feel that we missed out by not being in a gambling hotel - in fact it was nice to come back to the peace and quiet. I would definitely go back again!"
287,321,"May 11 2009 	Good value just off the strip with a kitchen.	Got the room on the day of my stay from a travel site. I did not know what I was getting. I was pleased by everything, from check in on. Great space, just off the strip. Instead of a little room which screams &quot;go gamble&quot; they offer a comfortable space with a kitchen and living room you can be comfortable in. Good value too. I'll use them again."
288,321,"May 10 2009 	Excellent service and stay	Room allocated spotlessly clean but we were put next to a carpark access gate which slammed constantly when guests arrived back at resort.A quick call to the front desk and we were relocated within 15 minutes.Decent breakfast, large 2 bedroom unit clean and well serviced by staff.Tip - ask for room on top floor to avoid noise from occupants above."
289,321,May 10 2009 	Quiet and Comfortable	Exactly what I wanted - something peaceful slightly off the strip. The rooms are really nice and it was priced reasonably.
290,321,"May 10 2009 	Excellent value and a quiet oasis not far off the Strip.	After reading the reviews we tried the Desert Rose and were not disappointed. Excellent value, very courteous and plentiful staff, and very quiet. If you want to be close to the action, this is not the place, but you are within walking distance of the 4 corners of the Strip. To avoid the crowds at breakfast, go early (6am weekdays, 7am weekends). No complaints, nice pool, generous poolside chairs/tables, etc, more than adequate continental breakfast, Starbuck's coffee, nice excercise room, very nice one bedroom condo, well equipped, in-room wireless internet, and all for &lt;$50 per night (using a travel site w/discount code). Very pleased and will go back. Thank you Desert Rose."
291,321,"May 9 2009 	Best room off the strip	The Desert Rose is a nice hotel w/ all the amenities of home. There is a full service kitchen which is so nice to have! The prices of the food at the restaurants are outrageous I would rather go to the grocery store &amp; cook my own meals. The rooms were comfortable &amp; spacious. I didn't need anything as it was all there for me. We had a nice balcony which is great for friends who smoke. The Desert Rose is in walking distance from a Casino &amp; groceries tucked away behind Hooters it's nice, no need to pay for parking. Quiet &amp; relaxing!"
292,321,"May 9 2009 	Even more than I expected	I found this hotel using Tripadvisor, and am usually satisfied - although sometimes the &quot;best value&quot; isn't the same as &quot;best&quot;. In this case we found both. We booked a 2 bedroom suite (these are timeshare condo's, actually) because there were no one bedrooms available on the nights we wanted. No matter - only $108/night didn't break the bank. After travelling for several weeks in Holiday Inns, Hiltons, etc we expected a nice but standard box. However this was indeed a complete 2 bedroom apartment, each bedroom ensuite, a full kitchen with utensils, wine glasses etc. Our unit must have been upgraded in the last couple of years so everything was modern and worked well. Other reviews indicate some plumbing problems so perhaps our unit was special - the 5 nozzle massage shower was really nice, for example. Also, the three TV's seemed a bit much, but it didn't stop there. The breakfast was reasonable but not extravagant. However the free wine and cheese (and a veggie platter) at 5pm was certainly an unexpected perk. It was really nice to have a chance to socialize around the pool in the central courtyard with other guests. Furthermore, my misgivings about security of our vehicle were allayed by the rather obvious 24 hour security guard in the lot. The Vegas strip is about a block and a half away, and the airport closer still. One would expect a lot of noise, but somehow the whole resort seems to be very quiet - as if its floating in its own bubble of silence. The friendly desk staff and concierge were very good at answering all our questions. If I go back to Vegas I would certainly recommend this resort to a friend - but there was so much space in that suite that my wife and I rattled around. I imagine it would be completely adequate for up to 4 people without any element of crowding."
293,321,"May 9 2009 	Desert Rose with Thomas Cook	Travelled direct from Manchester with Thomas Cook in economy, dreadful outgoing flight people crossing the aisle in extra leg room seats in row 9 even after being asked not to on four occassions by cabin crew. Gave up in the end but changed seats for return alot better. Desert Rose is a lovely resort next to Hooters and MGM Grand. A short walk to the strip short cutting through car parks. Small problem but quickly resolved by Judy the manager and Thomas Cook rep. Room space great and comfortable, could live there. Breakfast a bit of a mess, the food is good and varied but not many places to sit and eat, it is best to get there early. Now I know why people bring trays and baking tins down from their rooms and fill them up and take them back simply not enough room to sit. Will return without a doubt in the near future. Cocos restaurant to the right of Duke Ellington, just past the motel 6 sign."
294,321,"May 8 2009 	Great location and staff	I looked at many resorts through RCI for my visit to Vegas. Most had construction going on, were not in good locations, or had bad reviews. My first choice was the Desert Rose and I was thrilled when a room opened up. Our stay was great. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. There were nice robes for us to use and a continental breakfast every morning. The location was perfect just a block of the strip near the MGM and Tropicana - we walked to everything. The bathrooms were small, but there were just two of us so not an issue. I would definitely stay there again."
295,321,"May 8 2009 	CAN'T THINK OF ONE BAD THING	It's not very often in this day and age you can say absolutely nothing bad about a hotel that you've just left, but I can! Eight women made a Las Vegas adventure for 3 nights and 4 days and we all had the trip of a lifetime! The hotel is a big expense when you get away and I can honestly say that Desert Rose compares to those top-named hotels that most people with families can't afford. We ALL felt comfortable, well taken care of, safe and assured that we got a heck of a deal for the money. The hotel is just two city blocks away from the strip. Continental breakfast is free with your stay and we managed to drag ourselves out of bed to make sure we didn't miss the array of cheeses, eggs, breads, juices and fruit each morning. We even managed to arrive during their Friday happy hour and had our first buzz on them! The pool was clean, the grounds were clean, and the room was clean and neat. Security was seen in the parking lot and we were constantly met with employees that offered smiles - from the guy in the suit (making sure everything was done correctly) to the room cleaning staff and those other dedicated folks with very repetitious jobs. Again, we're talking eight women... How many places out there could have satisfied ALL of us? Thank you Desert Rose... We will be back!"
296,321,"May 8 2009 	Review a bit late but felt guilty not sharing how good the resort is!!	We stayed at the Desert Rose in Nov 2008, the review is so late but I always intended to give a great review of this resort and better late than never!! We were in Vegas to get married. We arrived 4 days before family arrived and couldn't wait for them to see the place. All the staff were amazingly friendly especially the cleaners and the lady who serves the drinks at the Manager's Special nights. The room was lovely and spacious and we were lucky enough to have a view over looking the gardens. If you do decide to stay here always ask for one of these rooms!! The rooms were very very clean and kitchen full with everything you need even a dish washer. The laundry facilities on site were a great help as well. On the day of the wedding the staff were very good bringing up flowers etc... The walk to the strip takes minutes, I bet less time then walking from your room to the entrance in one of the bigger hotels, and we felt really safe even wandering back at 3am! And the comp breakfast was very welcome every morning. This resort honestly cannot do enough for its guests which is very welcome and I hope it may always continue like this. The only probs we had were problems with flush in toilet (that was sorted within the hour by maintenance) and the key cards wouldn't work a couple of times (again sorted out very quickly). I will end by thanking all the staff from the Manager to the cleaners to the security guards and reception staff you made a very special time for us fabulous, and anyone considering this resort just go ahead and book it, its fab!!!"
297,321,May 7 2009 	Well pleased with all features of this resort... as billed	We read about 3 full pages of reviews before making reservation. All positive pretty much. Probably the strongest rating we have given any resort that we have reviewed.Suited us perfectly. Location is great to the strip and monorail. Great atmosphere. Nice little pool to relax by if you want to do that. We would recommend to anyone and will stay here again hopefully.
298,321,"May 7 2009 	Quiet little Gem and best value for the money hands down!!!!	Our family of 4 stayed at the desert rose May 1-6th 2009. I found the Desert Rose to be an excellent value for the price. I loved how it was only a 5 min walk to the strip, located in a quiet area. The FREE continental breakfast was FABULOUS, alot of excellent choices to eat.......one less meal to have to worry about especially dealing with trying to feed hungry kids first thing in the morning. The staff was always very friendly and accomodating, eager to help and always took the time to say &quot;hello&quot; The hotel was remarkably well kept, and they spent alot of time keeping the grounds neat and tidy. The pool is not large, but perfect for the kids to cool off in. Its nice to walk back into the hotel and NOT see a slot machine after walking the strip and seeing them everywhere - it was great to get back to the peace and quiet of the Desert Rose.The only downside, and no fault of the hotel is the ocasional wafting odor off the street, and a quite a few moths flying around outside and down the halls.......it was just the time of the year........we would stay there again in a moment, and are already planning our next vacation. We recommend this hotel to our family and friends - best value for the money, HANDS DOWN!!!!"
299,321,"May 7 2009 	I would definitly stay here again	spacious room, very friendly staff, loved the social time in afternoon, very quiet, but still close to strip"
300,321,"May 7 2009 	Can't wait to go back!	Having stayed here last year for a convention, I chose to come back this year without hesitation. The renovations going on last year are pretty much complete and they've done a great job. I used to stay in one of the large four star hotels on the strip, until I discovered this place. It's a short and safe walk to the monorail station which quickly takes you right to the convention center, avoiding the overcrowded shuttles and parking problems they have up there. It's like coming home to your own comfy condo at the end of the day. My wife joins me here for a few days now, enjoying a workout or some reading on the private patio and time by the pool during the day. We walk to the strip in the evening to get our fill of noise and bright lights, after all this is Vegas! We always say this would be a great place to bring our 7 year old, there are always a few kids around, but for now we're happy to keep this little hideaway to ourselves. It's squeaky clean, comfortable and has everything we need. Unthinkably quiet, considering the airport is nearby and huge casino hotels are literally around the corner. Think about a competitive nightly rate with free wifi and parking and you realize what a great value this is. They even have a simple breakfast and some late afternoon snacks put out. Just got back and already planning for our return!"
301,321,"May 6 2009 	Great Place to Stay	On my way to an outdoor adventure, I stayed for one night at the Desert Rose Hotel, recommended by the group I was to meet up with. I found the hotel to be very inviting, friendly front desk staff. It was quiet and peaceful, not slot machines - yeah!! . I found the room spacious and very comfortable. Because of time contraints I didn't have the chance to visit the inviting pool or Rec Room. Upon returning from the outdoor adventure, some of our group stayed another night at the hotel, some of us just spend a few hours with them at the hotel rather than waiting at the airport. The concierge helped me with my e-check in and printed out the boarding pass for me. I would definitely recommed the Desert Rose Resort."
302,321,"May 6 2009 	brilliant place	what a great place to stay off strip. We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the desert rose. We have been to las vegas 7 times (we are from UK) but was our first stay here. Includes full continental (and a bit more).There is a managers happy hour 5-7pm for beer, wine and soft drinks with nibbles like spring rolls or chicken nuggets and some other stuff. This is available mon - fri.The pool is good but can be abit cold but when you are hot from the desert sunshine, its nice and refreshing. Beds (sun loungers) and towels are provided free of charge.The roon was fantastic, separate bedroom with en suite, lounge and dining area with a very well stocked kitchen for those that like to cook. Our room was at the side so not much to see (just the top of the tropicana hotel) but was very quiet. Other rooms can be nearer the main road so could be a bit noisier.The only downside if there is one would be that its a 15 -10 minute stroll to the strip near mandalay bay, which is a the very beginning of the strip. This does not put us off staying here again next year. A suggestion would for the desert rose to have a free shuttle to the strip or other hotels on the strip. I highly recommend the desert rose to my friends who also has repeat visits to LV."
303,321,May 6 2009 	HOME AWAY FROM HOME	The Desert Rose Resort made our stay there so free and easy it was like being home.My spouse and I have stayed there many times. We have deceided that the Desert Rose will be the only place stay when we are in Las Vegas.
304,321,"May 5 2009 	Simple but perfect just what you need spacious and comfortable.	We needed a hotel for 5 days in vegas at the later end of our 2 week trip, wasn't sure what we wanted to do while we were there so we picked something that was not so in your face and themed, it was perfect. So glad we picked this hotel, there are no slot machines in site, they can get on your nerves, it was nice to escape from them. Walking distance for the strip and mono rail and very close to the airport. Breakfast can get very busy some days, we found it easier to take a plate down and get what you need and take it back to the room, you've got all you need in the room even a toaster for bagels that toasts one side. Nice touch to put out snacks in the evening just before you venture out onto the strip. I only spent one day by the pool, but it was very comfortable, loved to see young kids having fun. If I had to fly to Las Vegas again I would stay at the Desert Rose Resort"
305,321,May 5 2009 	I will not stay any where else in Vagas	We really injoyed the room and the people in Vagas. It was quite pleaseing to get there early and there was a room ready for us. Very clean and right next to the strip.
306,321,"May 4 2009 	Great Location - Great Stay	We had a great stay at this hotel. The location was great, just off the strip. Very quiet, smoke free and no casino. So if that is what you are looking for this is the place. The staff were very friendly, the room was great and the bed was very comfortable. Having a kitchen was really nice and it had everything a basic kitchen should have. The pool and the hot tub were so nice to have, we were able to take a break mid day and rejuvenate by the pool then hit the hot tub after a long day of walking. The breakfast was an extra bonus. Don't expect too much it is very basic. Cereal, bagels, bread, fruit, coffee, tea and juice. What was unusual was they had hard boiled eggs and ham. A lot a people brought a pan from their kitchen down and filled it up to eat in their rooms.To top it off the rooms had a free safe and free internet. Bring your laptop or Itouch and you will have all kinds of info at your finger tips. This hotel had everything we wanted and we would definitely recommend it and we would stay again if we are back in Vegas"
307,321,"May 4 2009 	Nothing better in Vegas	We were over in Las Vegas from New Zealand in a large group of 23 all of whom were staying at different casinos and resorts up and down the strip. During our stay at the Desert Rose many of our friends and family visited us at the Desert Rose and were extremely impressed at the venue, the facilities, the fantastic breakfast and the size of the rooms. Many expressed that if they travelled to Vegas again they would stay at the Desert Rose. My fiance and I stayed here for a total of 11 nights and ended up extending our stay as we enjoyed it so much. The rooms are huge for Vegas and you get a full kitchen which is so handy when you are staying somewhere for so long. I used the room to get ready for my wedding with my two bridesmaids, two hairdressers/makeup artists and my Dad and we still had plenty of seating in the room. We would recommend this hotel to everyone and will not consider anywhere else when staying in Vegas!!!"
308,321,"May 4 2009 	The best kept secret in Vegas	The Desert Rose is far and away the best value in Las Vegas. Just one block from the strip, it is convenient to all area attractions. But what makes it great are the rooms and the staff. The rooms are terrifically appointed and the staff is attentive to your every need.I will visit the Desert Rose on my next stay and recommend my colleagues and friends do the same.Terry BlackFairborn, Ohio"
309,321,"May 4 2009 	Wonderful quiet gem	We visited for a family birthday with 12 people and 2 babies and can't say enough good things about the Desert Rose. As one who is not a Vegas fan, this was perfect. Unless you wanted to walk the one block to the 'strip' you would never have known you were in the heart of the Vegas hustle and bustle. The pool is very nice and is kid friendly for families. They continental breakfast and weekday cocktail parties were very nice. The suites were nicely appointed, although the carpeting and some of the furniture needed upgrading, this was minor. The kitchens were fully equipped, and it was very nice to have a private balcony. The staff was friendly and helpful....Walter in particular was terrific when we needed a late checkout. I would definitely stay there again. It was a fabulous value."
310,321,"May 2 2009 	Awesome hotel!	Stayed here per Trip Advisor ratings, wasn't disappointed. Near enough to the Strip to walk, but far enough away (about 3 blocks) that it's much quieter. We asked for a quiet room and they gave us room 4305 (building 4, 3rd floor). We could see the pool from our balcony, but weren't right over it. The free high-speed wireless was priceless as I still had some homework to finish. The cold breakfast in the morning is very nice. There's a soda and wine reception every evening, though we never made it to that. Overall, one of the best stays I've had in Vegas. Would definitely go back again!"
311,321,May 2 2009 	We love Condo's	First visit to Las Vegas and we stayed for 5 nights- condo was uber clean (even the patio door)! Maid service daily was a step above. A short walk to the &quot;Strip&quot; or a short walk to the MGM Grand to catch the monorail. No car needed. Breakfast and Happy Hour were a Bonus. We would definitely choose a condo at Desert Rose over ANY hotel room on the Strip!
312,321,"Apr 30 2009 	Thank you Trip Advisor	I found this little gem thanks to T.A. We were there just one night (last night) but were so happy. Booked our one-bedroom suite about two months ago for $101 through Expedia and then checked a couple of days ago and rebooked it for a special $75 - what a deal! The suite was great, the pool and jaccuzi were great, the free breakfast buffet was good (cold only, nothing hot) and the location was great. The only flaw, and it's a serious one in my opinion, is that there are loads of aggressive pigeons everywhere. The resort definitely needs to import a couple of cats and/or have spray bottles handy at the outdoor tables. And there's cold beer free during 5-7 happy hour (wine, not too good) along with a couple of appetizers. By the way, if you love Mexican food, go to T &amp; T's at the Luxor. Prettybar/restaurant and I've never seen Mexican food (which was delicious and I've eaten lots all over the country) presented so wonderfully. Comfy tooled leather bar seats and great lighting."
313,321,"Apr 30 2009 	A very clean and quiet hotel.	This was our fourth time staying at the Desert Rose Resort and we enjoyed our stay as always. The rooms were clean and the service was great. The staff was very helpful and helped me retrieve my lost wallet. We liked the rooms, the quiet nights without traffic noise, and the pool. The breakfasts were just OK. We plan to return."
314,321,"Apr 29 2009 	Re review - goofed on 1st review	This was one of the best stays in Las Vegas in many years. It i close to the strip and all the hotels. The rooms are well decorated, frnished and equipped. Thye staff was very7 friendly and treated you like royalty. We will be going back next month.Lonewolf"
315,321,"Apr 29 2009 	Beautiful facility well located close to strip excellent value	great place , beautiful rooms... love the resort feel.Has all the amenities- kitchen, living room, 2 baths."
316,321,"Apr 27 2009 	Great stay	This a great hotel if you want to have some quiet place to stay after walking the Las Vegas Strip. Great value for your money, clean rooms, excelent service and perfect location. We just needed a place to relax and crash and this hotel exceeded our expectations. A great 800 square feet suite with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, dining &amp; living room. We only used the master bedroom for the two of us, we did not use the kitchen either but it has everything you need if you would like to save some bucks on food."
317,321,"Apr 25 2009 	Yep this is what they say it is...	The Desert Rose Resort pays attention to the details. We were in town for a conference and we needed a quiet place to work and relax. The Desert Rose delivered. Our suite was completely equipped with everthing we needed; the free internet was a huge bonus, the fully equipped kitchen (with dishwasher, oven, plates, silverware, and even a toaster), and the spacious suites allowed us to live and work comfortably while we were in town. It's not the Ritz, but it's one of the strongest values we know of in LV. The staff was friendly and efficient, making sure every detail was taken care of. We travel for a living and this resort stands out."
318,321,"Apr 24 2009 	Desert Rose Good Value For The Money	We just returned from an 8 day stay at Desert Rose Resort. Good location just a short walk to the strip and monorail. Nice looking property, comfortable accomodations, priced right. We encountered a few problems.... over flowing toilet, jammed safe, malfunctioning air conditioner. All problems were corrected in an acceptable time frame with a call to the front desk. Free continental breakfast was only adequate. It consisted of bread, cereal, bagels, hard boiled eggs, lunch meat turkey, and beverages. Not enough seating on all days we went. Many of the guests bring pans and &quot;load up&quot; with massive quantities of food and bring it back to their rooms. Do yourself a favor and skip the breakfast. Coco's Restaurant is a quick walk away. The food there is absolutely delicious, the service exceptional, free refills on all beverages and great bfast menu. Personally I would definately skip the continental bfast at Desert Rose. All in all; if you are looking for a non casino property this is a good value for the money. Something to keep in mind before booking is maid service is only every 3 days. We did call several times to request clean towels and they were quickly brought to our room, no questions asked, but daily clean towels and maid service would have been nice. I would reccommend this property to anyone who wants a non casino property close to the strip. It is a 3 star accomodation; not alot of frills; but clean and basic. I will close by mentioning that on our last day at the Desert Rose we found one cockroach in the kitchen. Management apologized profusely and told us that is common in desert properties to see roaches. We were told exterminators come weekly. ;-D"
319,321,"Apr 23 2009 	Great overall package/value/location	I come to conventions in Vegas all the time and really try to avoid staying at the Strip hotels (when I'm footing the bill). I've stayed Downtown and off-Strip and have found good values there, but this place has a great ambiance, is a safe 5-10 min. walk to the Strip, and having the complimentary breakfast is great. We had 3 people share a 2Br suite and it worked out great!The security staff is very conscientious too; I got a phone call at 1:30am that a window on our car was rolled down; something that we had overlooked when parking it. Sure, I didn't like having to get up to take care of it, but I'm glad they were out there doing their job!"
320,321,"Apr 22 2009 	5 out of 5 truely exceptional	pros-all of the above really, truely excellent.-apartment style rooms with fully equipped kitchen and lounge area, 2 tvs, large bathroom.cons-complementary breakfast is like feeding time at a zoo, not hotels fault at all, give out free food, they come running., days we utilised we were in and out. Not hotels fault but possibly a different approach to breakfast could be thought of."
321,321,Apr 21 2009 	still a great place	We stayed here last year and loved it. It is indeed an oasis with friendly people. Clean and quiet. I loved the kitchen and the ability to have coffee and toast before I got dressed.We are older people who don't drive in a lot of traffic so this is a great place to get to and find our way around town without hitting a lot oftraffic. There is the Monarail for the strip. Even a church close by.
322,321,Apr 21 2009 	Great - clean non-smoking well-located convenient and economical	I would not hesitate to recommend the Desert Rose. Excellent value.
323,321,"Apr 20 2009 	Perfect place for a non-party type stay in L. V.	My friend and I chose the Desert Rose for our trip to the World Cup Grand Prix and couldn't have been happier. It was quiet, comfortable and only a 10 minute drive (or less) from the Thomas and Mack Center. It was also convenient to the strip to which we walked for dinner our last night. Our two bedroom suite was perfect for two women with different sleep habits. My friend is a nurse who works nights and is, therefore, accustomed to staying up late. I, however, am an early to bed type but who likes fall asleep to the soothing drone of TV news talking heads. With TVs in each of out rooms, there was no problem.Because each of us had tickets to the evening competition on different nights , we didn't get to the managers reception more thantwice, but found it to be friendly and a real plus for the resort. The breakfast was only OK, in my opinion, especially since they ran out of yogurt almost every morning and it was totally absent on the weekends. The good side of that, however, was that it was quite easy to keep some in our own refrigerator.The other negative was that since it is a family friendly resort, there were many families with many small children and the pool was a bit unfriendly from a senior's point of view, but that's nit picking. All in all, I can't think of a place I'd rather stay in LV.I would definitely stay here the next time I visit LV"
324,321,"Apr 20 2009 	Great for families and a good value	We just got back from 2 nights at the Desert Pearl. What a great value! If you want fancy landscaping and pool valets who spray Evian on you, go somewhere else. But stay at the Desert Peral if you want a 1BR condo that has everything you need. Full kitchen, king size bed, adequate pool with free pool towels, sofa-bed for the kids, FREE breakfast, evening reception and NO gambling. Other than the fact that it's next to the Hooters hotel -- it's very kid friendly. Some of the reviews indicate that the furnishings were old and dated but it looked like our room was recently updated. New utensils, new fridge, new easy-clean electric range and dishwasher. It even has measuring spoons so it's very well furnished. The beds were older so if you don't like the old style sofa-beds, you might want to skip this place. The walls were also thin so when someone showers or flushes, you can hear it. This condo is a step above the typical kitchenette room -- normally part of the Shell Vacations Club time-share so has nice touches. The staff was friendly and left voice mail with the daily weather report. Breakfast buffet was hectic and not enough tables/chairs so we just brought a pan from our room down and brought food back to eat. The breakfast included cold-cuts -- which was strange. We just assumed they provided it for us to use for packing a picnic lunch. Only one compliant. They were doing some landscaping and seemed like &quot;natural&quot; fertilizer was used. But the smell just lasted for a couple of hours and didn't bother us unless we were outside."
325,321,"Apr 18 2009 	Beautiful little place right behind the strip	What a pleasant surprise! This place is right behind the Tripicanna which (coincidentally) was where our good friends were staying. Easy access to everything! Pretty one beadroom condo, great free breakfast and happy hour. We couldn't have been happier."
1,326,Nov 8 2009 	Nice Clean Comfortable and Quiet	The Element was a very comfortable and quiet hotel. Be prepared for a long ride to the Strip. It's about 30 minutes from the strip by taxi/shuttle. A great location if your visiting for a conference at the Red Rocks Resort and Spa. The bedroom was quiet and the room was very clean. Overall a very nice stay.
2,326,"Oct 28 2009 	Great the business traveler	My wife and I booked this hotel because of the relatively high rating at tripadvisor. We visit Vegas twice a year for leisure and decided to give this &quot;green&quot; hotel a try. I can say that this hotel is best suited for some types of travelers, but not every type. It is new, clean, and modern in appearance. I have no complaints in regards to the quality of the hotel. Although our one bedroom was quite cramped. The &quot;studio&quot; gives you a more wide open feel.I would highly recommend it for the business traveler since it has every accommodation and facility to support the business man/woman. Wireless internet is free and they have free fax and printing services. Very nice free breakfast buffet before heading out to the meetings.I would also recommend this for a family traveling to Vegas for some specific event (wedding, convention,etc.). Because it has a full kitchen in every room, it will suit families with children to the tee. I would also recommend this hotel for the buddies on a golf trip. There are so many exceptional golf courses within minutes (Red Rock Arroyo, Bear's Best, Siena). Golf buddies don't need posh accommodations, just a place to relax after 36 holes. I would NOT recommend this hotel for the romantic getaway. Sorry to say that we couldn't find any redeeming &quot;romantic&quot; qualities about this hotel. It's modern appearance, makes it slightly cold. There are no restaurants in the hotel, you would need to take the 15 to 20 minute trip to the strip. But then, coming back to the element after dinner just doesn't give you that &quot;romantic feeling&quot;. I would likely not return to this hotel unless I was on business, going golfing only, or with my kids. Romantic getaway with the wife, No way."
3,326,"Oct 19 2009 	Must stay here again.......	Great location for my golfing needs (TPC Summerlin) 10min away.Strip an easy drive 15min.Great contemporary &quot;W&quot; style/feel to the place, rooms with full fridge/kitchen...newDoes always smell nice, any part of the hotel.Great beds/bathGreat gymGreat DIY washing room.Great morning breakfast's/after noon snack/sFree internet/nice TV/DVDOutside BBQ &amp; pool if you don't want to smole out your room.5 min to Red Rock Resort Casino + some restaurants.I had a room well away from the elevators (by luck) but they do seem to make a loud noise when the door opens, so ask to be away from them.I'll be back next year (used STARWOOD points) for this trip"
4,326,"Oct 13 2009 	Amazing Experience!!!!	Hotel is located in beautiful Summerlin. We stayed here for a friends wedding that was in LV. It is about 10-12min from the strip, located right off the 215fwy. When you walk in the hotel it smells refreshing like green tea. Very modern decor. The rooms was AMAZING!!! We stayed in the one bedroom suite. Had a full kitchen, two TVs one in the living room and one in the bedroom. I don't care to stay in hotels, but this hotel totally different! It's CLEAN, the staff is friendly, the bed is COZY!!! LOVED IT!!!I can't rave enough. I have stayed in 5 star hotels and this by far has been the best!!!! The hotel is non smoking and there isnt a casino. However, there is a great casino about 2min away in Summerlin called the Red Rock- upscale casino from what I saw in the inside. If you have kids there is a great park just one street from the hotel. They offered free hot breakfast. Eggs, sausage, pancakes, breakfast sandwhichs, burritos, toast, muffins, ceral, yougut, smoothies, juice, milk, fruit. I give this hotel ***** 5 STARS!!! Thank you Element for the wonderful experience!!!! I know we will be back soon to visit! ITs been amazing!"
5,326,"Oct 9 2009 	Environmental Consciousness and Healthy Living-- In Las Vegas?	Element is a different kind of hotel, but different in a good way. It's the first hotel I've stayed at that seems to give serious attention to environmental consciousness and healthy living. The execution is not perfect, but it's a great start.The hotel is easily accessible off of the freeway and has plenty of free parking. The lobby is comfortable and inviting (as opposed to ostentatious or intimidating). The front desk service is genuinely helpful. And there are nice amenities even there, too, like a service to print out your airline boarding passes.The rooms are spacious and thoughtfully designed. There's a fully equipped kitchen and a comfortable desk. The bathroom has a &quot;rain shower&quot; but no tub. if you like to collect the little bottles of bathroom amenities, you'll be disappointed; the bath is equipped with environmentally sensible soap and shampoo dispensers. The beds are VERY comfortable and the rooms are quiet, making for a good night's sleep.There is a complimentary breakfast and an afternoon snack served in the lobby. You can also sit in the small but pleasant garden behind the lobby and eat. There is also a small pantry just off the main lobby that sells snacks and light meal ingredients at very reasonable prices.The hotel's service orientation and standards are first rate; they show through in the housekeeping, engineering and food service departments, all of which gave me excellent attention.If you want the glitz and glamor and excitement of the Strip, this place is not for you. But if you want some peace and quiet in a very pleasant setting, it's difficult to find fault with this property."
6,326,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Spot	I was a little concerned about the location when I booked but I needn't have been. Yes it's a travel to the Strip but if your not planning on gambling all day every day the location works well. We went to a show one night and took our boys for a walk down the strip another night and just parked in the casino carpark with no problems. The rooms are very spacious, clean and modern, we could easily have the four of us in there for an evening without sitting on top of eachother which is what we would have had, had we stayed on the Strip. Only negative comment would be the air conditioner is quite loud in the bedroom and language issues caused some problems at checkout. Will definitely stay here again!"
7,326,"Oct 4 2009 	Like a hotel should be	I think people like me were in the focus group when they planned this hotel concept. When I have to be in Vegas I like to stay as far from the strip as possible and this was a good choice. While it was a great room at a great value, it would be better if rooms weren't directly facing the highway."
8,326,"Sep 24 2009 	Enjoyable stay good facilities	Stayed for one week. Enjoyed the stay. Nice design. Kitchenette was handy, and room was clean. Breakfast, the pool, and the food store (always open) were all good. Nice, quiet, location in Summerlin. Free wireless internet was reliable and fast (12 mbit speed).The only negatives were that the kitchen dishes were a little unclean (I was going to wash them before using them anyway), the shower leaked onto the bathroom floor a little, and the fire alarm went off on my floor one morning (false alarm).Otherwise, would stay again!"
9,326,"Sep 20 2009 	perfect off-strip hotel	if you have a car, and wouldnt mind driving 20-25minutes to/from the strip, then this hotel is for you. because other than its off strip location, this hotel is perfect.great staff - check in takes 3 minutes. yes, only 3 minutes! took me an hour to get my rent a car. took me more at luxor the last time i stayed there.modern looking - boutique hotel styled room - heavenly bed, rain shower, lcd tv, fridge and microwavefree internet - great for those people who need to be online everytimebusiness center - 2 desktops that nobody uses. printed the tickets to &quot;love - cirque de soleil&quot; there. pet friendly - i saw pets all over the hotel free breakfast - weekday selections are slim - 2 kinds of sandwhiches, 3 kinds of cereal, 3 kinds of juices, a couple of pastries and thats it. weekend selections add pancakes, sausages and scrambled eggs to the choices mentioned above"
10,326,"Aug 14 2009 	Wonderful hotel!!!	We came to Las Vegas for a family event from Massachusetts and stayed here at the recommendation of my cousin. I'm so glad he steered us here. It's relatively new and has a modern urban decor. The space (general hotel and rooms) are upscale and very comfortable. We got an upgrade to a studio suite and we're very happy with the room. The bed is super comfortable, as is the couch. We have a very functional kitchen which has been very useful. Good shower and bathroom has more than adequate counter space.The staff has been very courteous and helpful. Well stocked workout room and common areas. The breakfast is more substantial than continental but not by much but that suits us just fine. While our room overlooks the highway (215), behind it are mountains. We also love the fact that it's quiet (even with the highway)...no casino and excessive lights and noise. If we want the Strip experience, it's an easy shot down Flamingo Road, but we don't have to be in the center of all of that chaos.If you're coming to LV for the Strip experience, you'd be better off staying there. But if you want to be able to take or leave that aspect of LV, this is a wonderful oasis."
11,326,"Aug 13 2009 	Love it	We loved the hotel, the hotel is great and clean. When we arrived, the room type we had requested was not available so they upgraded us to a suite at no extra charge.The suite was large and well kept.Great room for money!"
12,326,Aug 7 2009 	Overly Exceeded My Expectations!!!	I was looking for rooms &quot;on the strip&quot; and found prices for the weekend to be a bit much. I looked on TripAdvisor and stumbled upon this off the strip hotel. BEST hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas. Away from the smoke of the strip but close enough to drive to the strip. Recommended for people with a car to get to the strip. For those looking for a retreat hotel -- THE BEST!!! It's remotely located enough to have a secluded feel but close enough to shops and restaurants.
13,326,"Aug 6 2009 	Wonderful hotel at a great price!	Traveling through and needed somewhere to stay for one night that was &quot;dog friendly&quot;. Had never heard of Element, a new chain in the Westin Brand but they allowed pets so we booked.WOW! For less than $100 we got a mini-suite, queen bed room with FULL kitchen. Extremely clean and nicely furnished! Breakfast was free and lncluded the usual fare along with hot items (eggs and pancakes), yogurt &quot;smoothies&quot;, and their &quot;signature&quot; english muffin sandwiches of egg whites, tomato and cheese. My husband usually runs in the mornings, rarely using fitness rooms as their equipment is usually so bad. Surprise...the equipment was new and of good quality!I also liked that they had hanging, locked shampoo and soap dispensers in the shower, instead of the plastic, one use bottles.The only issue we had was that their street wasn't in our GPS, so I called the hotel. The hotel is on Discovery Drive, a cross street of Town Center Drive, but the woman working couldn't tell us what &quot;hundred block&quot; of Town Center they were at, or which way we should turn from the road we were on, so we ended up turning the wrong way. I had to call the hotel again, and another woman tried to use MapQuest to help us find the hotel as she didn't know where we were on Town Center even after I gave her cross streets! FYI - they are near 3800 South Town Center."
14,326,"Jul 25 2009 	WOW!! What a suprise!!	I was travelling with my 16 year old son and didn't know our schedule on the road trip home so my son suggested that we try Hotwire.com... We found this hotel under a three and a half stars for a great price so thought we would give it a try...Now location was nowhere near the strip that we could see, however after walking into our room this evening...Who cares?!! We checked in only 10 minutes after we booked at 11pm looking like something a cat dragged in.. The staff was welcoming and NOT snooty, a great start...And the room...wow... big, immaculate, brand new, bedding is nothing less than what I expect from a Starwood Hotel which means down filled duvets, feathery mattress pads and so many pillows!! Heavan! Shower is huge with rain shower head! And a large flat screen TV topped it off for my son! Nice touch guys!Thank you so much for making our stay wonderful!Will be posting photos soon :-)"
15,326,"Jul 21 2009 	Excellent Alternative to Extended Stay/Residence Inn	I stayed in a studio king for Friday and Saturday nights. The staff was wonderful, very welcoming and helpful, but not intrusive. The lobby is spacious and comfortable. I was impressed with the materials and finishes the room. They were quality metals, wool, wood, etc. not like the office furniture-like stuff at places like Residence Inn. The room was super-clean and I had no qualms about using the dishes and other kitchen equipment. The free Wifi was one of fastest I've used.Keep in mind the hotel is located in the &quot;big box store land&quot; suburbia part of Las Vegas. I picked this hotel because I was traveling with a pet. I could have stayed at the Westin right off the Strip, but the rates here (~$75/night) were too good to pass up. I also second the reviewer below about the highway noise, you can hear it but it isn't loud enough to be disruptive. My only two complaints are the volume of the A/C and the water pressure. I gave the A/C a pass because it was one of the hottest days of the year."
16,326,"Jun 29 2009 	ELEMENT Hotel by Westin in Summerlin NV ~ F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!	This high-tech, super contemporary hotel has it all ! Newly built in Dec. 2008 it features everything one would want in your own home. And CLEAN. Located in Summerlin on the northwest side of Las Vegas next to the red rock hills, hiking and 12 golf courses.WOW! Our room with a King Size Bed was a full 400 square feet. It featured: full kitchen with dark bamboo laminate, non-skid, non-scratch flooring, aqua-green/taupe horizontal glass tile backsplash, under cabinet lighting, quartz countertop, under-mount stainless sink, digital dishwasher and IKEA inspired MTF white cabs-(inside were very contemporary square plates and the new &quot;stemless&quot; bubble wine glasses..) toaster, full stainless steel fridge (and ice cubes) paper towels...and ORGANIC cleaning agents-Seventh Generation.Bath was a &quot;WOW&quot; also: large and super clean it featured, full wall glass shower doors + Landscape shower head + chrome handheld bar shower all set into a surround of combination brown/aqua/teal bamboo tile and and contemp square 'pool' bowl on glass counter. They provide thick white, WESTIN brand towels and a hair dryer. Bedding was all Westin - even featuring a double duvet system. If you like to sleep cold, you can turn up the AC and sleep under a lightweight TOG summer duvet, or toasty with the added heavyweight winter duvet on top. All sheets are organic cotton-and are for sale in the room's Westin catalog of soft furnishings inside the glass topped desk. Bed was large and very, very comfortable. Grandchild loved the L-shaped taupe tweed couch that faced the swiveling, HI-DEF TV. This is a great stay for the internet special of $103 per room per night. Pool was ok for lolling about-only 4 feet deep. We used the outdoor commercial sized, outdoor stainless grill and invited family over for dinner. They allow pets 40 lbs and under on the first floor.Quiet cement floor and wall construction with absolutely no noise between rooms or floors. Quiet and 30 minutes away from noisy Las Vegas gambling city centre. Price includes cooked breakfast of healthy foods: egg-white &amp; tomato english muffin sandwiches (bacon added if you prefer)- strawberry &amp; yoghurt smoothies- banana nut muffins and Danishes and great coffee!FINALLY..a Spa-like hotel that is affordable !!"
17,326,"Jun 21 2009 	We'd stay at Element any time any where. A great hotel experience.	Element is a new hotel concept from W Hotels and they got it all right. Well designed, comfortable modern rooms with everything you need right at hand. Internet access. Refrigerator and oven. Well thought out desk area. Fabulous beds. Great bathrooms with spa shower. Free parking. Free breakfast with style and fresh juices. Location is away from the noise and congestion of Las Vegas which is a good thing for us. Nice restaurants and shopping in Summerlin.We were so glad to find Element. The best new concept in hotels today. Only thing I would change is towels could be bigger and fluffier."
18,326,"May 15 2009 	Terrific hotel great staff amazing value	I stayed here for two nights for several business meetings occuring outside of Summerlin. It's a bit of a drive to get to most places in Vegas, particularly the Strip, but this hotel is so worth the drive. The rooms are huge, with new appliances, kitchens, free business center services, and free breakfast. All for reasonable rates. I highly recommend this hotel. Plus, the staff is excellent. I can't say enough good things about it. It's now my hotel of choice whenever I go to Vegas for meetings."
19,326,"May 14 2009 	Our First Element. Wish there were more.	Love this new chain of hotels from Starwood Preferred. Very stylish large rooms, well laid out. Bathrooms are terrific. Full kitchens include burners and oven, full size fridge, microwave and sink. All in stainless. Great desk space, LTV hi-def, iPod docking stationm, bathroom with great shower and vessel sink. I've never seen a room like this, modern and functional. Wonderful W beds. Free internet and breakfast. This is our new first choice when we're traveling. I heartily recommend Element to all."
20,326,"Apr 30 2009 	Best Extended Stay Concept	This is the best extended stay hotel chain I have stayed in yet. Hands down beats the competition. Problem is there arent that many around. I like the overall design and function of the Element better than their new sister chain Aloft. Element exudes quality Aloft exudes cheap. Hotel is generally quiet on the week days and really busy with families on weekends. Try to get a room (with an even number?) that does not face the highway- some road noise seeps in. Not enough to keep you up at night but noticeable. Location: Easy access off of 215 on the West side of Las Vegas, this is not a place to stay if you want to walk the Las Vegas strip. There is a gas/convenience store across the street, an Albertsons grocery store 15 min walk and by car there is plenty of shopping and restaurants one and two miles away. Outside the hotel there are long stretches of wide side walks good for running/joggingStaff: Friendly and courteous. The staff appeared to like working here which translates. Facilities: Modern minimalist. Pictures on their website are accurate. The social area has a large screen TV and a Nintendo Wii. There are two desktop computers for personal use and a kiosk for airline check in. Exercise facility had duplicate machines. Amenities: DVD Player, Flat Panel TV, Full Kitchen Frig/Dishwasher/Stovetop- no oven, plenty of dishware/flatware/pots and pans. They even supply sea salt and pepper corn grinders. Breakfast bar was well maintained and usually had one or two unique main course items a day. Evening appetizers were different each night and interesting not the usual fare you might find at a concierge lounge. Neither was a grand experience but enough to satisfy.Security: Room has hotel safe. The outside was well lit at night. Newly built up area felt safe."
21,326,"Apr 7 2009 	Loved this place!	April 4 - April 6This hotel was first opened on December 18, 2008, so everything is brand new and clean. Hotel came with everything, HD tv with HD programming, Westin bed, full kitchen with all GE appliances (full-size fridge, cooktop, microwave), plates, utensiles, etc. The bathroom was extremely bright and pleasant, with a huge shower, large mirrors and natural shampoos and soaps. In the morning, we would go downstairs for free breakfast, inluding pancakes, eggs, sausage, bagels, pastries, breakfast sandwiches, multiple juices, you name it. We found the hotel extremely comfortable and stayed in a whole day after breakfast without leaving. I completely disagree with the other reviewer about noise. We stayed on the second floor and the hotel is almost soundproof from outside noise. The hotel is about 10-15 minutes from the Strip, which isn't too far away. The area was quiet and relaxing, and less than 10 minutes from Red Rocks National Conservation Area. If you feel like going grocery shopping or grabbing a cup of joe elsewhere, there are plenty of shopping centers nearby. Overall, highly recommended!"
22,326,"Apr 5 2009 	Westin's Element Great Deal in Vegas	$99 on a Saturday night! All non smoking. 1 mile from Red Rock Casino on 215. Westin bed. Rain locker shower. Hot breakfast. The mod stuff is wasted on me. Some road and airport noise, bring ear plugs. This is an intro rate thru the website. Vegas on a Sat nite, $99."
23,326,"Mar 22 2009 	Pleasant alternative to the Strip!	The Element is a great place to stay when you want to avoid the congestion, noise, and expense of the Strip. My partner and I stayed one night on our way to Death Valley National Park, and we loved the cool, modern design of the Element. We had a one room suite that included complete kitchen facilities, sitting area, and complimentary wireless internet service. The bed was just short of Westin's Heavenly Bed in comfort, but the shower and bath facilities were great! The hotel's workout room is well equipped, bright, and clean. Our room faced the highway, and we wouldn't have known without looking out the window--sound proofing was excellent.The only drawback (as mentioned by another reviewer as well): Breakfast service is woefully inadequate. The idea is excellent, but the Sunday morning on which we ambled down to the lobby area we found an army of guests including several families waiting for THE SINGLE STAFF PERSON to bring more breakfast burritos to the breakfast &quot;buffet.&quot; A dozen burritos would arrive...a dozen burritos would disappear in a flash leaving everyone else waiting for the next delivery. The other components of the buffet--pastries, bread, yogurt--had all disappeared a long time ago. We would have been better off going to a local grocery store and buying some breakfast items for preparation in our gorgeous kitchen! (The hotel has a small pantry where you can buy a limited selection of frozen foods, pasta, and tomato sauce. Apparently wine and beer will be coming soon, but there is no full bar as in the Aloft Hotels) Or, there are several upscale coffee houses and restaurants in nearby Summerlin shopping malls that provide morning food service.Breakfast (or lack of it) won't stop us from returning to the Element. It's a comfortable, relaxing and low-stress place to stay."
24,326,"Mar 21 2009 	Nice modern hotel good value	We stayed here in March. The hotel appears geared to the business crowd however we were attending a large swim meet (swim meet not at the hotel) and many of the rooms were booked to swimmers. Anyone looking a nice hotel away from the strip would like this property. The hotel is new and the rooms all have contemporary style decorating. Our room had a king bed - very nice bed, a couch, kitchenette and a good sized bathroom. All very clean and well stocked. Some rooms look out to the freeway. The freeway is noisy however these rooms have more light and have a view of the desert. The gym is well equiped and there is a pool. For those that want a larger gym or pool, Las Vegas Fitness is very close and offers memberships by the day or week. The staff at the hotel was helpful and courteous. My one complaint is the free breakfast. The food is really subpar. Granted it is free, however it could be better. This is a great hotel for those that do not want to stay on the strip. It is close to everything yet not in the midst of the casinos. We got a good deal on Expedia."
25,326,"Feb 5 2009 	Locals Favorite	Our first &quot;Element&quot; experience. We only live two hours away and use a Vegas hotel for overnight business functions only. First of all, everything about the Element franchise reaches out to our sensibilities, the food in the morning, much better than you are use to for this hotel class, trust me, the decor, the shower, the natural light, work out facilities, etc. Secondly, the Vegas staff was fantastic in every way. Attentive, polite, professional. This location on 215 is real quiet, yet accessible to everything. I am a full time climber and guide at Red Rocks, for this it is perfect. My wife attends horse shows and no matter how far she has to drive across town, would rather stay here, clean, quiet, exacting atmosphere."
1,329,"Embassy Suites	The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was one of the best I've had at a hotel. I did not get to attend the evening reception because I was working, but from what I saw it looked friendly and inviting. I will stay here next time I travel to Vegas."
2,329,"Nov 22 2009 	Super trip	It was a lot of fun, we visited every hotel and every casino. We went to the Cirque du Soleil Show: O which was a very amazing experience, I totally recommend it to everyone who visits Las Vegas."
3,329,"Nov 6 2009 	Business in Vegas is never just ""Business""	Stayed here and it has all the amenities a vegas traveler needs! Truth is no one ever plans to stay in when their in Vegas if they are what are they doing in Vegas? The Hotel rooms are tasteful great bathroom and comfy beds! The free breakfast was delicious and not to mention the open bar :)! hotel is conveniently located a walk away from the strip..restaurants..and convenient stores!! :)"
4,329,Oct 27 2009 	Don't expect 5 star and you won't be disappointed	I generally stay here when visiting Vegas.It is a no gambling property - no clanking of slots!Breakfast includedOpen bar &quot;Free&quot; included during happy hourThe property is older and honestly not very attractive but the pricing reflects this.The fitness center is the minimum necessaryThe pool is OK but not fancyThe money you will save staying here will more than cover the cost of cab fare to wherever you want to go.
5,329,"Oct 26 2009 	Off the Strip but quite nice. Not the Bellagio but...	what are you expecting from a hotel called the Embassy Suites?Honestly, the hotel was quite clean, well done and the parking was free -- and you could literally walk downstairs and out to the car, not miles and miles away or $14 a night.Breakfast cooked to order was very nice and complete.Excellent value.The ONLY negative things i can say, a) 1.3 miles to the strip is a bit of a walk so buyer beware that it's not ON the strip.b) the shuttle service they offer is available -- but not frequently. i missed the 630pm and would have had to wait til 730pm. no thanks!The Envy steakhouse at the Renaissance Hotel next door offered a terrific $39 prix fixe dinner.Would stay here again as long as i had a car or walking shoes :)One last thing, if you have a chance, don't miss the Red Rocks recreation area about 17 miles out of town. Gorgeous and great hiking and bike riding."
6,329,"Oct 13 2009 	Truly A Gem and well worth every dime	Went to Vegas for my friends B-day but didnt have the funds to splurge on the hotel the rest of the group stayed in. I went here expecting Embassy Suite/Hilton quality of course but this place was great! Aside from the great Embassy Suites room (full living room, balcony, cozy bed in bedroom and luxurious bathroom) cooked-to-order omeletes and the breakfast buffet (pancakes, french toast, eggs, sausage, bacon, cereal, juices and MORE!!!). The hotel also provided a Happy hour everyday from 5:30-7:30 with free drinks, wine and snacks. Good times and good place to network! The location is a little far from the Strip (approx. 1 mile or so I believe) but only about a 3-5 minute walk to the convention center monorail which takes you directly to the strip. The monorail runs til about 2 or 3am after that you just have to catch a cab which isn't so bad. Aside from that you're away from the hustle and bustle to enjoy quiet at your leisure. My friends stayed at the Palms Place and MGM which were GREAT!!! but they didnt get the free happy hour and breakfast (though my friends suite at the palms place was ......WHEW!! thats all i can say). So if you're traveling on a budget this is a great place, plus Hilton Honors is always having deals. I just happened to luck out with 4 nights at like $250. What a steal!!! I would definitely stay here again (possibly for my trip to Vegas again in December lol)"
7,329,Oct 8 2009 	Great place to stop with family	We don't normally like to stay in Las Vegas but since it is half way to our destination we chose to stay there. We are not into the Las Vegas scene at all so wanted a hotel without a casino. We have 5 children and were looking for something affordable. We came across Embassy Suites on Priceline and for a family of seven it worked great. The room had a living room/sm. kitchenette area and then a separate bedroom. The room would sleep 6 and we put the baby in his own playpen and also had the staff bring up a portable single bed. The kids loved the pool and their favorite part (and mine) was the made to order breakfast in the morning that was included in the price of the room. That kind of breakfast would have easily cost us $40 at a restaurant. We were cozy in the place but it certainly worked for the one night we stayed and was clean and comfortable and the staff was helpful and the hotel was very nice. The kids loved the glass elevators as well.
8,329,"Oct 6 2009 	Great Stay	Great Stay! We stayed here one night due to the close proximity to the Convention Center, we then moved to the Bellagio, and immediately moved back to Embassy Suites.What a wonderful experience. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. Having the option of an evening cocktail at the Manager's special is a nice benefit, and the breakfast each morning was steaming hot and fresh, making it so convienent when needing to get to an event at the Convention Hall.The workout room was clean, equipment is updated and it is included with your stay. If you are a Hilton Honors member, the wireless internet is provided at no charge, a nice added benefit. The hotel was quiet and clean. You don't have to schlepp your luggage for miles into the hotel, parking is plentiful and free. We didn't mind being off the strip, it was a welcome respite from the craziness. You can easily drive to the strip, or walk to the monorail station for an evening of fun.When in Vegas again, the Embassy Suites gets my business!"
9,329,"Oct 1 2009 	Great Experience!	Great hotel, off the the strip! Not as upscale as some Embassy Suites that I have stayed in, but still nice. Enjoyed the breakfast and manager reception. The shuttle came in handy to the Convention Center and Fashion Show Mall. You have to call the front desk for pick-up. Downside- in door pool, but had an outdoor hot tub and lounge."
10,329,"Sep 22 2009 	Beautiful rooms friendly staff	The hotel was fantastic. Off the strip, so quiet, but only 2 blocks from the strip. Hotel provides free shuttle drop off and pick up to strip. All the staff members were extremely friendly and helpful. Rooms were very spacious and clean. Bed's were huge and felt like heaven. Cleaning service was thorough and friendly and fantastic with our belongings. Hotel food was wonderful. Laundry facilities located on floors 11 and 2 for convience. Free bar from 5:30 to 7:30 every night. Hotel was in mint condition with lovely fountain in lobby. Free computer priviledges. I loved the hotel."
11,329,"Aug 23 2009 	Very nice	Really nice place good staff and very clean.Comfortable suite with nice furnishings and a step out balcony, good if like me you smoke. Plenty of parking out front with security at night.Fantastic breakfast in the morning, don't miss it.Great hotel shame about the town, giant construction site full of well fed tramps and hookers, not a place to bring your kids. Good tip for a day out is lake Mead, hire a boat really nice and not expensive."
12,329,"Aug 14 2009 	Disappointing	Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. Travelling with 4 kids(3 teenagers). Thought that a 2 room suite will be a good alternative to booking 2 rooms at a hotel on the strip. Bad decision!Reasons.........1.Very far from the strip. 2. Neighbourhood appears &quot;shady&quot; 3. Sofabed unfit for sleep......kids very upset. 4. Park your rental vehicle at your own risk........see #2 5.Poor housekeeping......had to call housekeeping daily about multiple issues.In conclusion, while the rooms were not bad, the reception staff reasonably friendly, and the amenities average; the resort falls far short of anything I had stayed in the past, that belonged to the Hilton chain."
13,329,"Aug 10 2009 	Forbidden word ""Lesbian"" (net sites for GLBT blocked for this reason)	2:00 pm Saturday - I was very happy with the set up, a small living room with a nice bedroom and bath. The front desk staff was helpful as could be. 6:00 pm - The happy hour was great, free drinks, nachos, chips and popcorn. 12:30 am - Used hotel pc's in the business center to try and look up information on a mainly GLBT club. The site was blocked because it contained the forbidden word &quot;lesbian&quot;. Facebook was also blocked. Is this the US or China? I'll never stay at another Embassy Suites again. That perhaps goes for any Hilton Honors hotel depending on what I find out about GLBT sites being blocked. 1:00 am - Went to bed. I could hear my neighbors, particularly the ones above me in their bath, the water running, hair dryer, everything. There was also some strange loud noise like furniture being moved on a tile floor. It went on for some time. There were various other noises as well. 7:00 am - Woke up. The strange noise started again. Maybe it was kids blowing on something. With that and the noise from the other rooms there was no hope of going back to sleep. I could also hear kids playing in the pool two floors below."
14,329,"Aug 5 2009 	Fantastic !	We rented a two room suite and stayed here over the weekend of 4th of July We arrived around 9.30 in the morning and seeing that we were exhausted(had lots of baggages as we were only stopping by Las Vegas for 3 days en route to Nevada before heading home to New Zealand), the staff checked us in straight away. They were friendly and very helpful. The rooms were huge and the beds very comfortable.The toilets were big and the towels soft and plush. The suite has a dining table and a lounge where everyone could stretch and watch the big TV. What I liked best was the managers' special which runs from 5:30 to 7:3o every afternoon where you get to have free nibbles and drinks- any kind of drink(my husband enjoyed this very much). The free breakfast was just great- a wide variety of continental and cooked. You can even ask your eggs to be cooked the way you want them.You can not get better value for your money. The place is quiet, a bit far from the strip but hey, it is only about 20 minutes walk. It has a convenient store and a McDonalds just next door. One nice thing is you can use the internet(they have 2 computers) at the lobby and it's free. We enjoyed this place and will definitely stay here again. Thank you, Embassy for making our holiday an enjoyable and a memorable one."
15,329,"Jul 15 2009 	Nice alternative to the Strip	We booked this hotel at the last minute and got a good deal (I believe) with a AAA rate of $107 for a King Suite with a balcony. We arrived at the hotel at 2am and were promptly checked in. The room was nice and clean. The king bed was very comfortable which was welcome since we were exhausted. The sofa bed was not comfortable at all but I suppose they are not made for comfort. The hotel is non-smoking. They have an indoor swimming pool that we didn't use - I would have preferred an outdoor one but I would think the indoor version is welcome in winter.We had the free wi-fi which was a nice touch and came in handy. There are not many places to eat within walking distance - a McDonalds nearby but not much else. The hotel is a short drive from the strip - we enjoyed the proximity without the noise and traffic of the Strip.The best part of this hotel is the free cooked to order hot breakfast. It was awesome!!! It really makes this hotel a great value. Cold Selections: fresh fruit, assorted cereals, bagels, breads, muffins, danishes, Hot Selections: Bacon, Sausage, French Toast, Eggs, Potatoes, Oatmeal, and the BEST omelet bar that also makes fresh cooked eggs. Omelet choices were; bacon, sausage, ham, onion, bell pepper, jalepeno, mushrooms, tomato, and spinach.They had juice dispensers, coffee and tea. They also had a soda dispenser that had Coke products.We didn't participate in the manager's reception but they had nachos and popcorn the one night that we walked by.Overall, this was a great last minute booking for Vegas. For a nice quiet, non-smoking, non-casino hotel this was perfect!"
16,329,"Jul 13 2009 	Great value	Stayed a Friday night - cost around $100 including evening drinks and snacks and full breakfasts. Wow!Had a great room, lots of room and very comfortable beds etc.Pool looked great.A little far to walk to strip, but monorail close by.Nice people."
17,329,"Jul 7 2009 	Exceptional Value - Great Staff	Just returned from a week at this property. The staff were friendly and tried to accommodate all needs. Room was clean with flat screens in both rooms, and free WiFi if you are Hilton Honours member. Food (breakfast was great and cooks were professional). Great location away from all the commotion of the Strip. I found this to be a great value and a nice property."
18,329,"Jul 6 2009 	Why would you stay anywhere else?	We stayed at this hotel over 4th of July weekend, and we loved it. The staff was great, the rooms were immaculate and very comfortable. The sleeper sofa even had an innerspring mattress! The bathroom was very nice, and the towels were very plush. Breakfast was excellent - great variety and very fresh. For overall value, this was the best hotel I have stayed at in Las Vegas. Sure, the casinos on the strip have glitz and marble everywhere, but if you want quiet, affordable and family friendly, check into this hotel. I recommend you pay a few dollars more and get the large balcony. Ours was at least 10 feet x20 feet with two chaise lounges and three chairs  all overlooking the south end of the strip.The hotel is easy to get to from the airport and is convenient to the strip (the parking garage for the Palazzo and the Wynn are just a  mile up Sands Blvd."
19,329,"Jun 16 2009 	Typical Embassy Suites	I found this property to be pretty typical of Embassy Suites. I think a few of the previous reviews were a little harsh...you have to understand that this hotel is not on the strip, it is not a casino, and it is not a resort. It is located near the convention center. We found the hotel to be clean and very quiet, and the staff was courteous and helpful. Our only negative observation regarded one of the two breakfast cooks, who was not as good a cook as the other one. Overall, a favorable experience, and we would stay here again."
20,329,"May 4 2009 	An ok hotel...a little ran down	The hotel was ok...definately overpriced for its condition. Upon check in into our room, one of the beds didn't have the cover placed on the bed, the bathroom sink was making some really loud noise ( old piping i guess), the corners of the room were very dusty, the business center was off order, and thy don't have flat screen tvs. The staff was pretty frendly but nothing overly impressive."
21,329,"Apr 21 2009 	Good business hotel.	Right now, Great Vegas hotels are booking rooms at very low rates, esp midweek. So, if you don't mind staying in a very nice hotel, that happens to have a casino, I would go with that option. However if you are in Vegas for business, or passing through with family and wish to avoid the Vegas in Las Vegas, this is a solid choice. Good Breakfast, nice rooms, it felt slightly dirty, but I couldn't put my finger on an exact problem, just felt like it was a bit old and could use a scrub. Parking is good, the pool is inside, which is kind of odd for a place that has pool weather 8 months out of the year.Overall a good choice, but you can get a nicer room for less at a hotel with a casino."
22,329,"Apr 19 2009 	So-So	I was a little disappointed with this hotel. The rooms very outdated and look dirty. It's hard to tell if anything is clean as the decor is so dark. Our bedding had holes. No free WiFi, no flat screen tv's. It was okay for a night, but I would hate to spend a vacation at this hotel."
23,329,"Apr 13 2009 	Great place for Christian non-gambler (or smoker) with young children	We stayed here with four young girls (9,6,4,7 months) when my husband had an engineering convention. (Yes kids in Vegas for the Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon, The Shark Reef!!!!, The Children's museum!!!!, The Lion Habitat, The fountain and Garden at the Bellagio, The chocolate factory and the Dolphin habitat). We picked this place primarily because we did not want to stay on the strip and we always stay at an Embassy Suite because of the free (or included) breakfast. The service was excellent. They have a fountain that was fantastic for the children. It had thier undivided attention. It was very entertaining for them.We have seen more extensive breakfast at other Embassys but it was more than sufficient.One thing to watch for. We had dinner at the restaurant the first night and my 6 year old burned herself on the on-table candle. The flame comes over the top of the votive. The staff was very attentive and the dinner was free."
24,329,"Feb 23 2009 	Perfect for what we wanted	We choose the Embassy Suites Convention Center, because we had our 11 year old with us this trip and did not feel as we would be able to take advantage of a casino. Plus the added value of the free breakfast and the managers receptions. We arrived a little after noon, and our room was ready. We upgraded to one of the Large Balcony Rooms, and Im glad we did. They all face the strip, and the view at night is spectacular. I am convinced the view is better than anywhere we have stayed on the strip because you can see it all. The balconies are about 12 feet by 30 feet with several chairs and lounges. (See Picture) We only made the managers reception one night. About the same as any other Embassy Suites. This one how ever does not give you a limited number of tickets for drinks like I have run into at other Embassys, so it is all you can drink. The free breakfast is very good and the quality at this one was above normal. The room is typical Embassy, but I think they had just been re-done. Everything looked new and fresh. The bathrooms were above average size. The lobby has a computer to print out your boarding passes, but it was down, so the clerk offered to print them for us. Nice touch on their part. We rented a car, and this hotel is very conveniently located to the strip, and makes a good starting for doing all the touristy stuff. We had no issues parking at any of the casinos and malls. Day trip to the dam and Green Valley was only about 2 hours total, and worth the trip to me, but my daughter was not impressed with driving that far to see a Brick Wall holding back water. She would have rather just shopped that day. Did the sign. They have a parking lot now. Guess enough people were killed running across the highway that they decided it would pay for a lot. Once you park, you pretty much get in line and the tourist etiquette takes over. You offer to take a picture of the person in front of you with their camera, and then you ask the people behind you to take one of you with your camera, and so on. Pretty much crammed all the tourist stuff we could into our trip for our daughters sake. Volcano, Fountains, Conservatory, Sirens, Lions, Dolphins, M&amp;M World, Caesars Shops ect. We did see Cirque du Soleil KA at the MGM. I will put up another review of it, but we really liked it. I do have to add, that I thought the porn slappers did a very good job of pulling back when my wife and daughter went by. They did put them back out for me after they walked by, but hey, at least they have tact. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Embassy Suites and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone else. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions."
25,329,Feb 23 2009 	Very nice great breakfast 	Breakfast - made to order &amp; hotService - greatNot a slot machine to be seen in the hotel - nice.Near convention ctr but not so near to the strip &amp; casino's
26,329,"Jan 10 2009 	Fantastic Staff. Nice Location. Great Vacation	We're HHonors members. It took awhile to get into our room. Past check in time. But when we got it was just as we asked, on a high floor and a quiet room. Nice view of the city and the mountains. The next morning our tub backed up with very unappealing matter, but the front desk staff gave us another room to shower and dress in while they took care of our bathroom issues. The housekeeping was great, the front desk staff amazing. I heard more than one knucklehead complaining over silly things and they handled each complaint with grace and diplomacy. It was New Years Eve and the place was packed with all different types. The hotel is a typical embassy Suites with a very nice breakfast spread and atrium layout. The location is good and the front staff must have a way with the local cabbies because they show up within minutes. They even have a shuttle that they run back and forth to the strip hourly - which is not highly advertised. No charge!We'll definitely stay here again. Great place but the staff made it fantastic!"
27,329,"Dec 30 2008 	A hidden gem for meetings and families with kids!	I just returned from running a seminar at this hotel and I was very impressed with all aspects of service as well as the beautiful lobby, very well appointed meeting and sleeping rooms, the great indoor pool and the awesome full breakfast in the morning. We had some attendees just coming for the seminar and some were staying at the hotel and they were all very happy. My husband, one and four year old came with me and we stayed the weekend and I loved that we were close to the strip but in a very kid friendly, non-smoking environment. We all took the monorail and did go to the strip one day and it was a very easy walk and I didn't feel that the neighborhood was bad at all. Also, I think that the indoor pool at the hotel is the only one in Las Vegas so if you are coming in the winter with kids, having the pool, a frig and microwave in the room as well as the full breakfast makes this the only choice for me in Las Vegas...now that I have been here, I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
28,329,Oct 21 2008 	Loved the Room - Think twice about the location and neighborhood	The breakfast was great and the room was oversized and clean but the location of this hotel is less than ideal. There is no shuttle to the strip they just tell you to head down the block to catch the Monorail but the neightborhood is very scary and I wouldn't walk it at night. My vechile actually got broken into and the hotel didn't even care even though it was in their parking lot and under a light. They actually made me feel like it was my fault and have signs posted saying park at your own risk. What is that? Where else do I park? They obviously have a problem but won't do anythig about it. Now I'm stuck with a $350 bill to fix my car. Thank you Embassy Suites. Do not recommend this hotel.
29,329,"Sep 12 2008 	Peaceful in Vegas	This Embassy Suites hotel was a peaceful and very pleasant refuge from the craziness that is Vegas. We're not big Vegas fans, which is why we chose a non gaming hotel. This Embassy Suites is very nicely decorated and kept. The pool was clean and in a very attractive setting. Happy hour was okay although they don't provide many drink choices for kids and they are not allowed to order for themselves. Breakfast was very good, nice selection. The location was a bit far from the strip however the hotel does have a shuttle service and we recomend you use it. The front desk advised us not to walk to the strip but we didn't listen, It was a big mistake, it was so hot and not a great area to be walking in. Our teenagers enjoyed having Hard Rock cafe across the street. College was not in session while we were there so I have no insight as to what effect that would have on your stay. All said we enjoyed this hotel very much and it was probably the best thing about our Vegas trip."
30,329,"Aug 26 2008 	GREAT HOTEL BUT A BIT FAR OFF STRIP	The Embassy suites is a lovely place to stay, the rooms are huge, we went with my 15 year old daughter. There is a bedroom with 2 queen sized beds, then a living room with a pull out sofa bed, chair, TV, fridge, microwave and kitchen area.The breakfast was divine and is complimentary. It ranges from healthy fruit and yoghurt, cereals, bagel and muffins to eggs, sausages, bacon, waffles, pancakes....the list just goes on and on.We walked to the strip on the first night and it took us 25 minutes (brisk walking) to the middle of the strip. The temperature was 93 degrees at 8pm at night do it wasn't a pleasant walk. There is a shuttle that is literally 5 to 10 mins walk away that takes you to the strip but it costs $5 each for every trip so can become quite expensive, al so the station inside the hotels for the shuttle, takes you at least 20 mins from going in the hotel door to getting to the station to board the shuttle, you could have walked there by then. I love walking but with the heat and humidity it wasn't pleasant.If I go to vegas again I would probably stay somewhere ont he stip or a little closer to the strip."
31,329,"Aug 25 2008	Great Place for Families	We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning and 1 night at the end of our vacation to Zion, Bryce, Page, Sedona and Grand Canyon. Perfect place for our family of 6-kids enjoyed a swim and although pool is small and indoors they just wanted to cool off. Breakfast included was a bonus.Very helpful staff and clean through and through.Good choice for off of the strip."
32,329,"Aug 3 2008 	Typical embassy	This was a typical Embassy Suites. Away from the Strip, this hotel offers a much more peaceful stay that is still within a couple blocks of the action. The stay got off to a bumpy start when the key card would not open the door - however, we went down to the desk and the problem was remedied easily. That was in fact our only complaint, because other than that the service was excellent and the room was spotless. The breakfast every morning is amazing, and I'm sure there are not many places that can rival the selection offered there, especially considering it is free. All in all, great experience and definitely a good alternative."
33,329,"Jun 17 2008 	Very very average	Typical suites accomodation but service was very slow - took half an hour to get a TV remote and even longer for some simple room service. Breakfast was a real self service rush about but the omlettes were first class.The pool is a massive dissapointment, small and indoors and the outside heated spa is even smaller. Not a place for those after a pool scene.Hotel seems popular with resident and visting (mainly military) Brits who flock noisily to the free beer in the bar at five thirty. It is not exactly convenient for the strip and you will mount up taxi costs.All in all very very average; it's OK but it will not be my first choice next time."
34,329,May 18 2008 	It is very close to the LVCC	Fantastic staff!!! Everyone was really friendly and helpful. We were there for a convention at the Convention Center. The business center was nice. Great food for breakfast. No taxis to be found however. You have to call for a taxi and it may take a while. Not your usual smoky loud hotel in Vegas. It is a non gambling hotel so it would be more suitable for kids. I do agree with everyone on the sink and shower being really loud. You can hear everyone around you when you are in the bathroom. It was clean but it is dark in the room. Most people are not going to be hanging out in the room though. It is really close to the convention center and an easy walk. There is a little store next door. Not the worse area of town but not the nicest either
35,329,"May 12 2008 	Great place to stay....	First time staying 'off the strip'. The Embassy suites Convention Center is ideally located just a few minutes walk from the monorail so access to the strip is easy. The hotel is modern and clean with huge rooms. Additionally, you get a full cooked breakfast to order as part of the cost of the room AND free drinks from 1730-1930 every day. My wife and I saved $300 at least over our 10 day stay...If you don't mind quiet rooms and no gambling in the hotel then this is the place for you...great brewery and restaurant about a mile down Paradise Road!"
36,329,"May 11 2008	Great For My Needs But some issues	We are a frequest Hilton (Embassy Suites) guest and knew what to expect. We were excited because we wanted a room near the strip but off the strip and we rented one of the rooms on the top floor with the huge balcony. Upon checking in half the funature was no on the balcony. We did like still having another balcony off the bedroom also (was very small couldn't sit on it). The huge one was great for entertainment once they replaced the furnature (they took it from the 9th floor balcony. They didn't clean our room one day and insisted we had the DND sign on the door (the funny thing is we never had one, we kept asking for one too). So they brought it put it on the door and someone stole it after the mades did their cleaning (ok if they insist, and I'm sorry would of been nicer). One other huge problem was the connecting door to the room next door although it had a deadlock was able to be pushed open. My 14 year old went into the room herself and some man was trying to get in. Turned out he just moved into the room next door and was trying to see what he door was. The issue I had with them is they tried to say he couldn't get in due to the deadlock, but we could see him he could stick his hand in, NOT GOOD - FIX IT!!! We enjoyed out stay but until they fix that majo issue with the door we will nto return."
37,329,"Apr 30 2008	A Quiet Rest	This hotel is off the strip and offers the sensitive traveler a quiet respite. Check in was impeccable and swift, the room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious. The only disappointment was my call to the Front Desk for more towels was either forgotten or ignored.The hotel is located behind the Wynn and it's about a mile walk to the Wynn entrance. There is a Las Vegas Monorail station a 5 minute walk away."
38,329,"Apr 19 2008 	This Embassy Suites is a little past its prime	The bad points outweigh the good for this tired Embassy Suites about a mile from the Las Vegas strip. First the good -- it is clean inside, I had no issues with housekeeping. It is quiet, I was not bothered by outside noise. And the wi-fi is consistent, with a good signal, and as a Hiltons Honor member, there was no charge for it. But the bad points are numerous. The hotel is past its prime and the hot water roars like a bull when it's turned on. I am sure my early morning showers disturbed other guests. The entire time the water was running it sounded like a jet engine. The hot water handle on the bathroom sink came off in my hand and I had to screw it back on. The small refrigerator was turned off and smelly when we first checked in, and once I turned it back on it dripped annoyingly through the night and disturbed my sleep. The vending machine on my floor was not well stocked and would not take dollar bills for my entire stay. There are only two guest washing machines for a hotel with 11 guest floors, and I could never find one that wasn't being used. The hotel does not offer a shuttle to the Strip, so if you don't want to face Las Vegas traffic, you're limited to taking the monorail, calling a taxi (none hang around the Embassy Suites) or walking. And while there is a monorail station about four blocks away, the hotel is located in an area of Vegas that borders on seedy, and I would not recommend making that walk at night. Lastly, I found the hotel staff to be a little on the impatient side and not overly anxious to help with routine questions. Overall, a less than pleasant stay."
39,329,Mar 28 2008	Highly Recommend	Very nice hotel. Breakfast was great . Sleeping was quiet and comfortable.
40,329,"Mar 11 2008 	Consistantly Embassy Suites	This is not the place to stay if you want Vegas action, but that said, being in Vegas, it does have a more active and lively happy hour and bar than other Embassy Suites I have been in, which can be good or bad depending on your tolerance for the sound of people enjoying themselves echoing through the place. Especially if your room is close to the 3rd floor Atrium. I didn't mind, and I liked the lively atmosphere.The breakfast was better than other Embassy Suites I've been to. It had more hot plate offerings, such as french toast and more diverse ingredients for the omelettes. The room service food was surprisingly excellent and affordable. The fitness room is small, three treadmills, a few mulit-use weight machines that I didn't want to try to figure out what a couple of them were for. But nice and bright, with a view of the pool.The rooms are looking slightly dated and are a little dark. I found myself utilizing every lamp as the bulbs weren't very bright and the color scheme was dark.And the person that wrote about the fridge freezing everything was right on.The front desk was super nice about allowing me a later than usual check out. The parking lot is convenient and while the hotel is off the beaten path, there is plenty nearby with a quick drive or walk to get to."
41,329,"Feb 23 2008 	Can't believe it's Hilton Family	I fully agree with some of the comments that staff are rude in this hotel, the receptionist with name tag of Ashley is horrible, I have never met any hotel staff with such manner. I really don't understand why she is so bad to customer when we just arrived and wanted to check in. It's not just impolite or inexperience, she seems to hate doing her job and show bad face to us. We visited many hotels every year and this is absolutely the worst I've ever come across in the past twenty years."
42,329,"Feb 9 2008 	Goodclean hotel.	WE stayed at this hotel in December for 5 nights for our wedding,Good clean rooms ( did move on the first night due to being too near to atrium bar) but this was not a problem.Great breakfast,free internet with free printers,especially helpful to print off boarding passes,When we stayed it was extremely busy but we just got up a little earlier to avoid the lines.As stated before 5 mins from shuttle station,and five mins by taxi to a huge shopping mall which.is off strip so cheaper.Had no problems getting around either walking or by taxi.The big strip hotels are huge,fancy but a little impersonal,but this one is great value for money,and only a little out of the way."
43,329,"Feb 1 2008	Pass	Pass on this one. To far from anything with a very marginal cafe...staff was rude and unwilling to help. Checked out after one night, paid $260 a night. Checked into Hilton Grand Vacation Club at 2650 Las Vegas Blvd...now that is a great place, and I paid $140 per night..."
44,329,"Jan 29 2008	Our family's favorite hotel	For a fmily of 6, with 4 teenage kids, this is the best place to rest, have a delicious breakfast, and even a &quot;happy hour&quot; complementary&quot;"
45,329,"Jan 6 2008 	Didn't care for this place	I almost hesitate to express my views here, as so many Trip Advisor posters seem enamored with this hotel. In fact, I booked this hotel based on the reviews I read here.We'd booked a room for five nights, but ended up checking out after the first night as the hotel just wasn't what we had in mind.Yes, the suite concept is handy, and the happy hour and breakfast is a nice touch. However, it was difficult to get a drink due to the small bar area and the masses of people bellying up to the bar at Happy Hour. Breakfast was a similar mob scene, and while the food was tasty, the crowded breakfast area was a major drawback for us.We also found the hotel noisy, as all the rooms face the atrium and the noise really travels.Our room was in desperate need of an overhaul - it was dark and gloomyand the living area furniture was soiled and worn. The bathroom really needed some attention - the tile around the showercould have used a good scrub and repair - tiles were loose and some had fallen off. Chunks of grout were missing and the rest was just plain dirty. Thecold water spigot came off in our hands every time we turned the water on, and the toilet paper spent most of its time on the floor, as the dispenser was hanging from one nail.Every time we turned on the water in the bathroom we were met with a loud howling noise from somewhere within the pipes.The room left us with an overall impression of neglect and dinginess.We were looking for a comfortable, quiet off strip hotel experience and this particular Embassy Suites didn't fit the bill, so we left andfound a cleaner, well-maintained hotel in a much quieter, less chaoticarea.Parking at the hotel wasn't a problem, but it was a bit of a pain to get in and out of their parking lot, as the monorail runs through hereand it's easy to miss the turn.This hotel might work well for some, but it didn't work at all for us."
46,329,"Dec 30 2007	Typical Embassy Suites	My wife and I generally choose Embassy SUites over other hotels, as wehave found them a great value. This ine is no different. Excellent happy hour (the bartenders are great and very friendly). Breakfast was very good, though you need to get there before 8am to avoid the lines and have a place to sit in the atrium. If the atrium gets filled, they open one of the conference rooms, but there are no windows. Instead, take your food to the thrid floor and eat in the bar (also in the atrium).The rooms were the usual size for an ES, and had the usual amenities, including a microwave oven. If you keep milk the the fridge, turn the firdge to warmer or the milk will freeze. They use shower doors instead of curtains in the tub (thank you!!!), but as with most hotels, the shower head isn't quite sufficient for a good rinse. When will hotels stop putting flow restrictors in the shower heads? They do not save water. It takes x amount of water to remove x amount of soap. It can be done in 30 seconds or 120 seconds, but it is still the same amount fo water. There was a tiny bit of mildew stain on the tub calulking along the door, Generally the batroom was in pretty good shape- not perfect, like 90/100.We would stay there again."
47,329,"Dec 16 2007 	Bravo!!!	Best Embassy Suites I have ever stayed at. We came up for Thanksgiving week and spend (8) nights there. We love staying at Hiltons and Embassy Suites is our favorite of the chain. We booked one of the rooms with the large balcony (Anyone can book this room it just costs more and they are limited as they are the top 4 - 5 levels only. Most of the other rooms had a smaller balcony (but are cheaper). This balcony we had was huge - probably as big as our room, two lounges, 6 chairs, two tables, our toddler could ride her tricycle with plenty of room. The room didn't seem to be upgraded any other way, but it was clean and nice. The breakfast was very good and kept us from oversleeping mornings. If we made it the manager reception was good (better then at most Embassy Suites). The staff we encountered were nice. Our cleaning person was nice, and they don't try to get out of cleaning your room each day. They keep a good watch and get you when you leave the room. You don't see them they just clean. I would leave notes with tips as I deemed and were all completed. They even tucked in my daugthers doll. It was nice to stay away from the stip with the kids and there are four daycare centers in 10 miles and two closer then 5 miles. I give my best recomedations to this hotel!!!!"
48,329,Nov 30 2007	awesome	awsome rooms really comfy and spacious. the atmosphere is nice and still close to everything esp. if your in town for a convention.
49,329,"Nov 29 2007 	Very comfortable	After deciding to brave Las Vegas at Thanksgiving with kids, we used all our Hilton Hotel points to stay at Embasy Suites for four nights. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this hotel. It's off-strip, non-smoking, and quiet (except for the kids running around at breakfast). The hotel offers a free buffet breakfast, which was pretty good, hot, and with a lot of variety. There was a huge line the day after Thanksgiving, but I think everone wanted to get out to go shopping. The pool was clean and fun, just with a bit too much chlorine. The beds were comfortable, the staff was friendly, and the room was clean. I loved the bath soap, too! We were about 1 mile from the strip, but there were still a few casinos within walking distance, in case the gambling bug strikes. Also, the LV Monorail is just a 5 minute walk, and it's a great, safe and clean way to get to the strip if you don't have a car. There was always a cab sitting outside the hotel, too. If you're going to visit Las Vegas, this a great choice for an off-strip hotel.(The only glitch we experienced was that my mom stayed with the four of us, and has a bad back. We had asked for a rollaway for the room(instead of her using the pull-out couch), and I called a few times during the week prior to our arrival to confirm it. When we arrived at 11pm, there was no rollaway and we were informed that it is Embassy Suites policy not to allow rollaways in rooms with two beds and a pull-out couch, due to space and fire hazard issues. I am okay with all of that, but just wish I had known before arriving. )"
50,329,"Oct 19 2007 	Best Hotel off the Strip	We stayed 4 nights, Mon-Fri in October, after a wonderful road trip through Arizona. If you are looking for quiet place to relax, then this is the one for you. The hotel was in good condition; the rooms were spacious with a living room, large chair, sofa sleeper, TV, table and chairs; plenty of counter space; we used the mini frig, coffee pot and microwave every day. The bedroom had 2 double beds and TV. The majority of their rooms face either north or south. We were on the 10th floor (11floors total) and faced north. A beautiful view of the Hilton, Stratosphere and surrounding hills. Noise was never a problem. If you don't have a car, then it is quite a hike to the strip. We drove to all the major casinos; nearly all have free parking and elevators that take you right into the casino (of course). The breakfast was great; a large selection. The only problem during the work week is that they close at 9:00. The manager's reception is a plus; they have plenty of snacks and appetizers, hot and cold. The bar area was kept very clean. Yes, it does get crowded so get there right at 5:30.!! or take your beverages to your roomWe found the hotel staff very pleasant and gave us a late checkout with no problems.The only down side is that the hotel pool is indoors and being from the wet Pacific Northwest, even the sun in October makes you want to sit out. They have a large hot tub and chairs outdoors for the sunbathers. It would have been nice to be able to swim in the sun. The entire hotel is non-smoking; another plus for us.I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay again."
51,329,"Oct 18 2007 	How perfect can a hotel be?	We stayed at the Embassy Suites for 13 days from September 27 to October 9 and everthing was absolutely perfect! We have stayed at some of the worlds top hotels such as the Peninsula in Hong Hong or the Imperial in Vienna and never have we been treated with such sincere courtesy and comfort. After an unfortunate initial experience with the front desk associate ( Amanda) we were immediately taken over by Rickey who had us settled in our room in a matter of minutes. The room was the usual Embassy suite comfortable bed and totally sound proof with central air conditioning, two TV's, fridge and microwave in the living area..The room was spotless as was the bathroom. Towels,soap and bath ammenities were first class. Breakfast was terrific especially the made to order waffles. If you eat in the Grill Room try the hamburger as it is the best I have ever had. The prime rib is to die for as is the pasta and we shared each of these dishes. Maria is a super waitress.Happy hour(s) are well attended and say hello to Tad at the bar to see what NFL team he is going with this week! We used the pool almost every day as the temp. was in the high 80's and it was always spotless as was the outdoor huge hottub and tanning area.Supervisor Angelo Lim always seemed to be around ensuring that the guests were well taken care of and several times went out of his way to assist us. It was a pleasure to be off the strip and to have lots of on grounds parking which was never a problemWe cannot think of a single thing to complain about as our entire stay was simply wonderful. I should also mention that the houskeeping was great. We requested that our room be serviced every day before 1 PM and they never missedWe then moved to the so called 5 star Ritz Carlton for two nights at Lake Las Vegas and what a dissapointment after the Embassy Suites.We already booked the Embassy for next February and can't wait to go back."
52,329,"Oct 14 2007 	2nd stay	Enjoyed staying at this location off the Strip last year so decided to stay again this trip with our 25 year old son. Our suite on the 7th floor would have been a little cramped with our son sleeping on the sofa bed so we asked for a larger corner suite. No problem - we were given one on the 3rd floor. It was next to the restroom for the bar, but as the bar closes at 11pm it was never a problem. The staff at this hotel are very helpful, the breakfast buffet is excellent and sets you up until the evening."
53,329,"Oct 3 2007 	An Oasis in Vegas	We stayed at the Embassy Suites from 29 Sept to 02 Oct 2007.We were very impressed !!First of all, the Hotel is all non smoking, a huge bonus to us non smokers.There is no Casino which to us was another bonus. After being out on the town for most of the day and evening it was a delight to return to the tranquil atmosphere of the hotel.You are only a seven minute walk to the mono rail and can be on the strip in 5 minutes.Being a relatively small hotel there were no crowds to contend with, I dont think we ever waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator !!The suite we had (# 810) was spacious, very clean and quiet.The staff are very efficient and politeBreakfast is included and was delicious.The nightly Managers cocktail party was another bonus, kudos to the staff who run the bar in such an efficient and friendly manner.There would be no question as to where we shall stay whenever we vist Las Vegas, The Embassy Suites is truly an Oasis in the middle of such a fast paced and busy city.Go there, you will be pleased with your decision !!"
54,329,"Sep 25 2007 	Outstanding Value	Booked at the Embassy Suites for a Saturday and Sunday in September. My wife and I were in Vegas to see a couple of shows but the rates for the major casino hotels were pretty outrageous, especially for Saturday. Embassy's rate ($159/night) was favorable and the Trip Advisor reviews were generally very good, so we made our reservation.Our experience was excellent overall. The rooms are currently being updated and are very attractive. The service from the staff was top notch. The hotel is very well maintained. Embassy is just a few minutes drive from the Strip and offers a complimentary shuttle to the casinos. We would definitely stay here again."
55,329,"Sep 2 2007 	Good off the Strip option	This is a good location pretty close to both the Strip and downtown Las Vegas. I like the fact that there is absolutely no gambling in the hotel; it's a nice change from everywhere else in town. The manager's reception was pretty nice, and they had some nice snack options. The area is small and can get filled pretty quickly. The breakfast was good- the omelets were great. My daughters didn't really like their muffins, though. The staff was nice and very helpful. Our room was nice enough, but there was a little mildew around the shower. Oh, and the sink made an awful noise when turned on. Not a big deal, but I think they are getting due for a renovation. We had room service one night, and the food was good and came pretty quickly.Overall, it was a good value for the location and the class of hotel. We'd most likely stay again."
56,329,"Aug 26 2007	Needs some updating but a good value in Vegas	I stayed at this property for one night. I have not stayed at an Embassy Suites before.The front desk person was very friendly and helpful. Parking was easy and free. My room was very big, larger than the apartment I lived in during school.Bottled water was waiting for me in my room which was nice. The breakfast had great coffee and a popular made-to-order omlette bar.The room is somewhat rundown which detracted from my stay. The AC was making weird banging noises for part of the night. The walls are quite thin; I could hear the telephone ringing in the next room."
57,329,"Aug 26 2007 	Pretty good place all things considered	It's clean, it's quiet, it's smoke free. The breakfast in the morning was very good. The afternoon complementary snacks and drinks are okay. The food consists of nachos, popcorn and a snack mix. We did not eat lunch or dinner at this hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurant. The decor was a bit above the usual Embassy Suites. When I asked for early maid service they were more than happy to oblige. The wireless internet connection was very good. I was a bit surprised that there was a charge for local calls. I think it's good that there is not a slot machine or other game of chance in the building. If you want to gamble, it's not the place for you. In the summer, it's probably advisable to have a car since the monorail station is not that close. Being from the northwest I am not used to 100F+ temperatures and I found it difficult walking in the heat. Thrifty has cheap rental cars and there is always lots of parking near or on the strip. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat. ."
58,329,"Aug 17 2007 	Nice place to stay with family	I stayed here while on a business trip. My son and husband also came along. Very nice hotel. The complimentary breakfast is awesome. Nice variety and saves money on breakfast. The pool is quite small, not too big. The Manager's reception in the evening is okay, I don't drink alcohol, so it wasn't a big attraction for me. The snack was always nachos and cheese and chex mex. The hotel gets a little noisy when the reception is going on in the evening. Otherwise, it is fairly quiet. It is a nice place off the strip. Overall, I would recommend it for someone who wants to be away from all the glitz on the strip and have a nice place to stay. The internet is not free in the hotel rooms, but there are two PC's in the lobby area that can be used for free. The front desk staff seemed pretty helpful and knowlegeable too."
59,329,"Jul 17 2007	Quiet smoke-free hotel	I chose this off-strip hotel because it is smoke-free, which was a welcome relief at night. Our room and bathroom was very clean and the layout with two rooms (a living room and a separate bedroom) is great if one person wants to take a nap while someone else wants to work on a laptop or watch some TV in the living room.Be sure to remember a cable to access the high speed internet. I forgot mine, and there is a $9.95 charge per day for wireless access in the rooms. Another important thing to know is that there are no in-room safes available here. I tried to check in my laptop at the front desk, but their safe is too small for my thin-and-light laptop so I had to end up lugging it around (didn't want it to fry in the car). So I suggest bringing a laptop lock if you want to keep it in your room.There is no hair conditioner provided, so bring your own and don't assume that it will be supplied. The made-to-order omelettes were a hit with my family, but the pastries/donuts weren't very good. Our room was right next to the elevator and you can hear it running up and down, so if you want more peace and quiet ask for a room that isn't directly next to the elevators."
60,329,"May 28 2007 	Definitely one of the best off-strip options!!	A little apprehensive ahead of arrival as have previously stayed on the strip, at Luxor. However, the benefit of The Suites is that it's situation is no more out-of-the-way than Luxor, Mandalay Bay or similar and the monorail station which links this and the neighbouring Renaissance to the Strip is about 4 mins walk - exit reception and turn right, infront of the convention centre.What to say: great hotel, very modern, bright atrium reaching 13 floors high and very welcoming ambience, with a cafe / restaurant on the ground floor, as well as a mid-size indoor pool, plus a bar on the first floor balcony. Our room was on 13 ... as high as you can go and wonderful views, even not over the strip itself. Watch out for LAS air traffic turning right on final approach, just outside your window, but not a hint of aircraft noise. Suites are HUGE and ours had a sizeable lounge with atrium view, kitchenette, very nice bathroom and a wonderful bedroom looking over the city. All staff were pleasant and swift in attention, very helpful should you need their assistance, parking out front is included in the rate. What's more - the price puts this as maybe the most attractive hotel in its class in all of Las Vegas ... a definite winner for us and should we be back in Vegas soon, I'd definitely book the Embassy Suites once more.A plus for car rental users, the hotel is on Paradise Rd, exactly 7 mins from the airport terminal without a need to turn left or right."
61,329,"May 28 2007 	A good Embassy Suites	The rooms are standard ES layout, but decorated and furnished a notch above most other ES I've stayed in. I noticed the atrium area is smaller than most, causing some congestion at breakfast (although they have a second buffet set up in a meeting room for the overflow). This does not affect ROOM size, just the atrium. Also the managers reception in the evenings is in a small area with too few tables/seats. I just skipped it. I'm on the 11th (top) floor and the AC is fine, can hear noise in the atrium from the living room, can't hear a thing from the bedroom. Walking to the strip is quite possible if you like walking (good 20 mins). Just take Sands westbound and you pop out between Wynn and Venetian (would be uncomfortable in summer though). Overall I would gladly stay here again anytime."
62,329,May 21 2007 	Good Off StripNon-Smoking Option	I spent two nights at this property last week with my wife and adult daughter. The facility is well maintained with ample free parking. The rooms are spacious and quiet. The monorail runs right down Paradise Road in front of the property but the nearest station is at the Convention Center. You certainly can walk to the Strip from this property but I would suggest driving your car and parking at The Venetian or The Wynn which are both minutes away and easy to get to.There is a very excellent business center with two computer terminals in the lobby. The breakfast area was clean and well maintained with multiple choices. The indoor pool is of reasonable size but the outdoor hot tub is spacious.I think that this is a good choice if you want a non-smoking facility off the Strip and have a car at your disposal.
63,329,"May 20 2007 	Great Find in Las Vegas	Grabbed one night at the Embassy Suites.The hotel is in great shape, the room was spacious and clean.They offer a free breakfast and a free happy hour in the evening.No casino at this hotel. Quiet location. They have a pool but it's not a Vegas pool scene. This hotel is close enough for those adventurous and in decent shape to walk to the strip. (Takes about 20 minutes - I walked in the 95 degree heat.)For one reason or another, I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip. The accomodations at this Embassy Suites are as good, if not better, than many on the strip.For Vegas convention goers, this hotel is certainly far ahead of the Las Vegas Hilton.Only drawback was a Guest Services clerk who was somewhat difficult when asked about a late check-out."
64,329,"May 10 2007 	Great value and extras as well!	Great value! I was concerned with some bad reviews but some people just love to complain. This hotel offers free high speed internet, (can't even get that at Ceasar's) large fridge, and even free bottled water. Check in was prompt and if you want a no smoking room just reserve a king suite as they are all non smoking. Bring your own DO NOT DISTURB sign for the door they check rooms at 9AM. Only minor problem was therre is only one ice machine and it runs out of ice and then the bar is quick to fill your ice bucket just ask. The casino is small no like there aren't others right out the door though a slot machine is the same everywhere."
65,329,"May 4 2007 	Great break from the strip	My husband and I needed a one night stay in Las Vegas as were were traveling on to Arizona. This Embassey Suites was great. There is no slot machines or smoking which was one of the reasons I chose them. They have a business center with two computers in it. The front desk was wonderful with directions, quick check in and check out. Breakfast was great, a typical Embassey Suites. They have a small gift shop on the main floor. There is a fun water fountain in the lobby. Our room was very nicely furnished. Our king size bed was very comfortable. It was a little warm in our room and no way to control. I think the front desk can control room temperatures. I enjoyed the fact is was off the stip and was quiet. It was and easy drive to The Venitian. Parking there is free from the back streets. There was a pool area, we did not have time to use it so I can not advise on it. If you are looking for an off strip hotel this one is nice and close enough to drive to everything."
66,329,"May 4 2007 	Great Hotel	The hotel was great, except for one day. Newer hotel, rooms are great. The only problem we had was with the air conditioner. One night (1:00AM) we woke up in a pool of sweat. The air conditioner decided to turn it self off and turn on the heater. When we woke up the room was at 95 degrees. We called the front desk and I guess that this has happened several times because he had a sheet of a paper with directions on what to do. The only other problem was with the room key not working. They told me not to have the key next to my cell phone. If you read some of my reviews this is an event that has happened to me during the entire month of April. The breakfast was great as was the manager special. This is the first time that I had chilli cheese fries at the manager night. This hotel is faces the back of the Venetian/ Wynn. The monorail runs right in front of the hotel, but to catch the monorail you will need to drive to the station. I think the reservation desk tells you that there is a shuttle from the hotel to the airport, but the hotel will only take you to the airport."
67,329,"Apr 9 2007 	Loved it!	My wife and I stayed at this hotel from March 23-25 and enjoyed mostly everything about it. the location is great...not too far off of the strip. we rented a car for the weekend so it was not a problem to get to the strip and back. I would recommend renting a car versus taking the monorail or walking because the monorail is not that close to the hotel and parking is free all over the strip.The happy hour was fantastic and so was the breakfast. The only downside about the breakfast was the line got a little long..but it moved fairly fast. Plenty of choices and they kept bringing food and more food when it was getting low.The hot tub is huge! We didn't use the pool...so can't really comment on that. The rooms were big and the beds were comfortable. The only downside was our room smelt like smoke. It was a &quot;non-smoking&quot; room but clearly there was smoke in there. It didn't really bother us after a few mintues so we just stayed in the same room.Everything in the hotel was really clean and nice. I would say it was above average for the typical Embassy Suites. It was nice to be a little of the strip to receive a break from the lights, people, and casinos!I will definitely stay here again."
68,329,"Mar 25 2007	Glad to have stayed here	I was in the Marriott Courtyard on Paradise Rd, and was so disappointed that I moved after the the first night. The Embassy Suites Hotel Convention Center was bright, clean and inviting. A complimentary happy hour was offered every evening and a full breakfast iwas served in the morning. I was very pleased with my stay here."
69,329,"Mar 18 2007 	Wonderful Stay	We chose this hotel to be off strip since we were traveling with teens to the Nascar race. Our suite with 2 double beds and a sofa bed was more spacious than we expected and worked wonderfully for the family to spread out a bit. The breakfast was among the best we've had at any Embassy Suites and the evening manager's reception included such things as chili-cheese fries and nachos in addition to the standard snack mix. Even though the hotel was sold out for the five nights of our stay, we never encountered any problem with parking availability for our rental car. The location was great for us. If we wanted to do something on the strip, it was a 2 minute drive, but it was nice to be away from the hubbub. The business center with it's two computers was great for checking email and checking in for our flights."
70,329,"Mar 9 2007 	Great Place	The Embassy Suites hotel is fantastic. QUIET!!!!! Great morning buffet type breakfast, great large outside hot tub, plenty of room in the suite! I'd highly recommend it. The higher the rooms...the better. Also stay away from the lower floors 1-4 near the front because of the nightly noise caused by the manager's reception and stay away from the first 3 floors in the rear of the hotel due to the free breakfast area."
71,329,"Mar 8 2007 	Sin City Fun	Embassy Suites... what else can you say. Actually, this is a nice set up.There are some pluses and minuses. For the pluses... a convienent place to stay if you are involved with a convention. The happy hour (complimentary) has a nice spread of appetizers, not just chips or pretzals. The sun through the atrium might be a problem if you are facing the front of the hotel but it does light up the rest of the hotel. The breakfast, as with most Embassy's, is good. Seating is adequate and there is a TV to catch CNN or ESPN or what ever is on. The rooms are decent with the normal suite set up (small refrigerator, microwave, sink, and living room and bedroom). The hotel is not very noisy which is a plus.For the minuses... you are not on the strip. It is a very long walk to the strip. You are better off walking to the convention center (10-15 minute walk) and catching the monorail to the strip. The pool is indoor's and not much compared to the set up of the pools at the top casino's. Parking can be difficult depending on how full the hotel is. If you have a gambling fix... there are no slots or tables at this hotel.Overall, I still enjoy staying at the Embassy's. If you are a Hilton Honor's member you can even check in online 24 hours before hand and select your room. Good luck travelers... and even better luck to you gamblers."
72,329,"Feb 11 2007	Beware! Nice hotel but you may be stuck there	My husband &amp; I stayed here for a convention at the Sands Convention Ctr. Feb. 8-10, 2007. The suites are very nice - spacious, clean, with comfy beds, good sized fridge, 2 TV's. Free Breakfast is quite good -- yummy omlets. Free cocktails from 5:30 to 7:30 can be a zoo, but the bartender pours well and is a good guy. Staff was pleasant, although it took some nagging to check in early -- they didn't seem to be jumping through any hoops to get me a room earlier than 3pm check-in time. Our problem is getting out of the hotel. Monorail is over 3 loooooong blocks away, and it drops you off way in the back of only a few hotels. Walking to the Sands conv. center is a loooong 1/2 mile. Trying to get a cab to pick us up on Friday nite proved impossible. We ended up eating in the hotel restaurant -- not by choice, but it was actually pretty good. Other guests reported similar frustrations getting to the Strip. Missed dinner reservation due to lack of cabs. I love to walk and am in pretty good shape, but Vegas demands a lot of walking anyway, and my feet got tired enough from walking the strip, Fashion Show Mall, etc. Cabs at other times of the day are available. There seemed to be a lot of families with kids there for gymnastics or cheerleadingtournaments -- a fine hotel if you are not going to do stuff on the strip, or are staying mid-week."
73,329,"Dec 20 2006 	nice hotel away from the glitz but close enough for fun	stayed here for business Dec. 14-16th. 2006. Overall a very decent place, friendly staff, convenient location, no problems at all. Because I work Las Vegas frequently, I'm not a big gambler and have seen most of the sights. This hotel is a nice change of pace, no slot machines in the lobby like the majority of most establishments in LV. The rooms are nice, as with all Embassy Suites, it was a 2 room suite, the bedding was comfortable, the mini fridge was handy for my soft drinks I usually have on the road, the breakfast was very good [fresh prepared omelets and other selections] The location is fair to good. It is on Paradise road which is just east of the strip, it's not an area I would recommend to walk around in late at night like you can on the strip, but I felt safe and secure. It is very convenient for those visiting the Las Vegas Convention center, I didn't have business at the convention center this particular trip but I have stayed at other hotels in LV when attending conventions and it's either a cab fare, monorail ride, or long painful walk . Not so from this Embassy Suites. I did go out one night, walked to convention center monorail station, caught a free shuttle to the new Wynn Resort [WOW!], then walked south on the strip to Paris/Bally's then caught the LV monorail back to hotel which is a 5 minute walk from the convention center monorail station. Something I always rate a hotel by is the quality of their internet connection that I need for work. I easily connected wireless and had an &quot;excellent&quot; connection from my 8th floor suite. Overall a nice stay, I would recommend this hotel for anyone not needing a gambling casino on site."
74,329,"Dec 12 2006 	Great place off the strip	We recently stayed at this hotel from Dec. 5-8, 2006. The room was huge. Every room is a two room suite, which would be great for family. I can't comment on the housekeeping because we kept the 'do not disturb' sign on the door because we didn't require new sheets or towels for a few nights stay. The full complimentary breakfast every morning was great; made to order omelettes, potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, etc. were all included with beverages. Definitely worth getting up for. The only drawback to this hotel is the location. If you plan to spend a lot of time on the strip, you'll need transportation because it is not within walking distance. We utilized taxis and the monorail mainly, but it became pretty costly. The Las Vegas Convention Center was within walking distance, however; this is also the nearest monorail stop."
75,329,"Dec 6 2006 	Off the Strip but convenient to Monorail	Stayed here in early December for three nights. Typical Embassy Suites property, maybe near the top of the range for this brand in terms of overall condition of rooms and hotel. If you are a Hilton Hhonors member, this is maybe one of the better choices in town.Location is on Paradise Road, which runs parallel to the Strip (LV Blvd). It is an easy 10-minute walk north to the Convention Center monorail station, and an additional 5 minutes to reach the north hall of the Convention Center. We found it convenient enough for our leisure trip. Tip: across from the monorail station at the SW corner of Paradise and Desert Inn roads is the waiting area for the Wynn shuttle. Our room had a small balcony just wide enough to stand on and get some fresh air. Rooms at the end of the halls on 9th and 10th floors have gigantic balconies with lounge chairs. If you are an Hhonors Diamond member, you might ask to be placed there.Property attracts business travelers and families. Considering the free breakfast and happy hour, it's a good value alternative to a casino property on the strip especially if you are renting a car anyway. Monorail is $5/one way (buy a two-ride ticket for $9...two people can use it), or a taxi to mid-strip (Paris) is $10."
76,329,"Nov 30 2006	Surprised	I was a little leary coming to this hotel after some of the reviews I read, and honestly only picked this place because I wanted my Hilton Honor Points. When I pulled up to the hotel, I was even more leary.....the exterior is quite &quot;70's&quot; and I was afraid the interior would be as well. I was pleasantly surprised to see the place has been completely remodeled. New furniture, carpet, and granite countertops to boot! My room was a spacious two room suite with a kitchenette. The other benefit was they have their own parking lot, so I didn't have to walk three blocks or valet park to get to the hotel. Free drinks at the evening reception were a plus as well. This great place to stay if you don't mind being a little ways off the strip!"
77,329,"Nov 9 2006	Best non casino hotel	This hotel cannot be beat!! Near the action(right next to convention center) but not too near!We just got home. E.Suites was a relief being off the strip. Things are much quieter. We had a mondo view from our room and huge balcony with chaise loungers and a patio table and chairs facing the monorail and golf course. This hotel sits behind Wynn.. We slept like babies in the comfy king sized bed!. I have stayed at many Embassy Suites, this one is tops!The breakfast and manager's afternoon (free drinks/snacks) was great! We loved it and it was nice not to be so guarded there unlike the strip(with kids). Room was awesome down to the granite countertops/sink tops. However, no free shuttle to strip. The only thing missing was jets in the tub!! A+"
78,329,Oct 17 2006 	Great free extras!!	We spent a night here over the weekened and the price was excellent compared to those a mile away on the strip. Located close to a Monorail station and with comfortable rooms this is a wise budget decision. The best thing about hte hotel is that from 5.30pm to 7.30pm they have free drinks (anything you want) and bar snacks(pretzels/nachos) for all residents. A great way to start off your Vegas evening and the hearty breakfast is well recommended for when you return the next morning.
79,329,"Oct 6 2006 	Great Breakfast!	It's nothing fancy like some of the big resort/casino on the strip. The 1-bedroom suite is 3-star quality. Not nice, but at least it was clean. The sofabed needs to be replaced since it's very bouncy and I could feel the springs! The included breakfast was really good! They make omlettes by order and there're plenty of other hot items."
80,329,"Oct 2 2006 	Great Hotel In Vegas	If you want to enjoy all vegas has to offer, then sleep well at night, stay at the Embassy Suites at the convention center. The hotel is very clean, quite and the breakfast is great for a pleasant start to the day.To enjoy this hotel, rent a car and drive to all of the hotels on the strip plus downtown at night. Once your night is over, drive over to paradise road and over to your hotel. It is very safe to park on the lot and there is a convenience store next door to get any beverages you need.Hotel staff will not go out of there way for you but who cares, you are in vegas. Cechis in is the only time you will deal with them, and that takes less than 5 minutes compared to 1 hour on the strip.Have all of your tourist information before you go or get somewhere else in vegas, hotel has none and staff acts like the do not live in vegas.Remember, rent a car, it only cost about $20.00 per day at thrifty.p.s. get a convertable you will be glad you did"
81,329,"Sep 11 2006 	Good Off-The-Strip Value	We spent three nights at this hotel and we enjoyed our experience. The hotel was clean and neat, although the carpeting was being replaced in the hallways during our stay, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Each evening, from 5:30-7:30, there was a free happy hour at the 3rd floor bar, serving beer, a limited selection of mixed drinks, and snack foods, like chips and salsa, popcorn, and snack mix. Each morning, the free breakfast buffet offered make-to-order omelets, other hot foods, and fresh fruit. Both the breakfast buffet and the happy hour were great perks and popular ways to start the day and the evening.While this hotel is off-the-Strip, a short cab ride and $10-11 (with tip) can quickly get you to any on-the-Strip hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful and ready to call a cab for us at any time.Our one, big disappointment was in the pool at this hotel. It was small, indoors, and not at all what we were expecting. There was a small hot tub-type pool outdoors, but we didn't spend any time at either. Instead, we went to another hotel's pool to enjoy the type of experience that we were hoping for but didn't get at the Embassey Suites. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this quiet, clean, friendly hotel. If you are looking for the excitement of the Strip, then this hotel may not be for you. There are no casinos or shopping in this hotel so you will need to go to the Strip to enjoy those activities, but if you are looking for a more laidback, easy-going vacation in Las Vegas then this is the hotel for you."
82,329,"Aug 21 2006	loved the Embassy Suites	Spent three nights at the embassy suites and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone. Large, modern suite with huge balcony overlooking the Strip and beyond. Panoramic views from the bedroom. Good value room service. Generous happy hour. Plentiful and varied breadfast ( although too little wholeweat for European tastes!) Good value cab ride to the Strip; cabs always available; 7 minute walk to the mono rail. Excellent, cheerful staff and wonderful location, an oasis of calm after the bustle of the Strip. Very good value!! Excellent calming water feature in lobby. Well done Embassy Suites, Paradise Road."
83,329,"Aug 2 2006 	Great Value!	I was pleasantly surprised during my stay. My room was great. I like the separate livingroom/bedroom concept. The beds were great. The bathrooms were fantastic and huge! I dined in the restaturant for breakfast and dinner and got a great meal each time. The only thing I didn't like, which had nothing to do with the hotel, was the time it took to get a taxi. It was a great value for the price. I would stay there again."
84,329,May 21 2006	Great choice	Great choice. We had a top floor suite with large balcony which had views over the Wynn's golf course towards the Strip and the mountains beyond. The rooms were well appointed and clean. The staff were helpful and quick to help. The water feature in the foyer has seating around it which guests like. The breakfast buffet sets you up for the day with a range of cooked and cold foods.
85,329,"May 2 2006	If you want a great deal in a non-casino hotel - this is it!	We traveled with our son to Las Vegas for a week. Embassy Suites Convention Center was the perfect location - no noisy casino - great cook-to-order breakfast (our son was thrilled and he's picky eater!) and a manager's reception that is a great way to begin an evening! The staff was very helpful, our room was great - no problems. We took the monorail to the strip - right down the street - that can get a little expensive for 3 people - but I'm glad we did it. We had dinner there also &amp; that was very good. The pool and whirlpool were just right for us - not a lot of kids - indoor pool for when it was a little windy out. We had a taxi to the airport inside of 5 minutes - it was great! I highly recommend Embassy Suites Hotel Las Vegas Convention Center! Definitely would stay here again!"
86,329,"Mar 29 2006	A Nice Escape...	Needed a short escape and chance to introduce a friend to Las Vegas, without all the gaming and noise. This hotel definately fit the bill. Safe, comfortable and convenient to the Strip without being on it.The staff was excellant and helpful with a couple of minor problems that could have quickly turned into serious ones.The room was clean and well appointed. The beds were very comfortable and there was enough space for five adults.Attractive interiors but not showy and free of gaming, this hotel not only deserves but guarantees a return visit."
87,329,"Mar 11 2006	Wonderful stay at the Embassy	We were looking for a non-gaming hotel near the strip for our brief visit to Las Vegas. We found the perfect establishment at the Embassy Convention Center on Paradise Road. They were very helpful and friendly whenever we needed assistance and the room was very big and comfortable. It was just like being at home. We had a 3rd floor room, with 2 queen size beds, as well as a living room with a sleeper sofa. The 2 TV's came in handy as our grandson could watch what he wanted and the wife and I could watch what we wanted.The prize of our stay was the free breakfast buffet. They had eggs to order, bacon, sausages, potatoes as well as a bunch of other continental items. Go early to beat the business crowd.The hotel is near the strip, but not as crowded. You should get a car if you can as the walk to the other places can be far. The monorail is down the road, but it is a generous walk. It is located near the airport, Paradise Road runs straight to the airport, maybe 7 minutes away.Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again."
88,329,Feb 28 2006	Ok.....	View was awesome-great big balcony staying on the 3rd top floor.Close to the strip and easy to get cabs. Terrific breakfast included.However our door kept not locking-they did attempt to fix it twice but still felt uneasy. Also if you dont mind air conditioner noise being similiar to when you are on a plane then this place is not for you. Had to get earplugs because of it.
89,329,"Jan 24 2006	Disappointing	Second time we have stayed, second time we have had problems. The air conditioners were non-functioning which resulted in all air circulation being down Thursday thru Sunday. We were never apprised of the problem during check-in, had to confront the issue with management after a very stuffy night. Relocating to another hotel was not an option as it was the opening weekend for the National Rodeo and hotels were packed. While management reduced the bill by one night for the inconvience, a hotel of this caliber should have a policy of alerting patrons of problems prior to check-in. Am a regular guest at Embassy Suites but will avoid this one in the future."
90,329,"Jan 22 2006	Typical Embassy Visit	Stayed there for CES, if you are going to the convention center, consider this property. The front door is 5 minutes from the convention center and a safe walk in daylight or dark. I had a room with a balcony that overlooked the Wynn $500 a round golf course. Not too difficult getting a cab to the strip and the steakhouses at the Renaissance and Ruth Chris are in walking distance."
91,329,Dec 29 2005	End of a Perfect Trip	We had just completed a whirl wind trip thru the southern end of Utah and finished the visit off by staying at the Embassy Suite hotel. The rooms were large and comfortable. The breakfast was very good and free. We will stay here again if we end up in Vegas. We stayed at the MGM Grand at the start of the trip and were very disapointed.
92,329,"Nov 14 2005	Nice Place off the Strip	This is great place to stay if you want to be close to but not on the Strip. I agree with the other reviewers that you need to have a rental car, or be willing to walk to the monorail stop (which is very close by).I also had a problem getting hot water. It seems to take a long time for the water to change from tepid to hot. On my second day, I started the water while I shaved, and the water was hot when I was ready to shower.Staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is good. The fitness room was okay, but would be full with 3-4 people.It is very easy to get to this hotel from the airport even during rush hour."
93,329,"Oct 30 2005 	The walk is farther than you think...	This is a nice, clean hotel. But be warned, when you view the location on a map it looks like it will be located a lot closer to The Strip than it actually is. We attended a Convention at the Sands Expo Center and we thought we could walk it everyday. No way. Between the actual walking distance to the Expo Center and having to dodge traffic because of the lack of sidewalks, we took a taxi to the Expo Center everyday - (about $10 each way). The Embassy Suites shuttle will drop you off at Harrah's, which I did once. If you are lucky they will let you jump out as you pass the Sand's Expo Center. That was an adventure - in high heels!What I liked about the hotel was, it was nice to come back to a quiet hotel room after spending the day on The Strip. The daily breakfast was also a plus. We were able to grab a quick bite to eat and arrive at the Sand's Expo as it opened in the morning.If I drive myself out to Las Vegas for the next Convention I would stay at Embassy Suites. If I fly again, I will be looking for a hotel a little closer to The Expo Center."
94,329,"Oct 18 2005	we will be back	We got to las vegas and had a reservation elsewhere but the room didnt get reserved like it was supposed to have been this was when the american idol auditions were on and vegas was SOLD OUT luckily enough we called the embassy hotel and got a suite which we gratefully accepted and are we glad we did the hotel we were booked at was a one star (going cheap this trip lol)When we go to the embassy the room was beautiful clean and comfy. We had a problem with the toilet and the desk people were on it in a heartbeat they were lovely to deal with. The monorail is a five minute walk away and we used it, next time we'll be renting scooters and just scootering back and forth. We have always stayed on the strip but we loved it here and will will definatly be back!"
95,329,"Oct 15 2005	Consistent Quality	This hotel is a place to feel safe at which is important to us while staying in Vegas.The rooms are spacious, as they make your beds and replenish your towels everyday. We left our mp3 player on the table when we left the room for the day and came back that night and it was still there to no suprise.The staff seem to really care about your every need.Also, this hotel is also about value especially when it comes to the free breakfast and cocktail hour every day.(The food is great and the cocktail hour does include some premium liquor.)If you are looking for plush, elaborate art and decor and a lot of glitz and glamour, this is not the hotel to stay at. However,If you like to come back to a clean, quiet hotel after being out all day,then you may want to consider booking a trip here.We saw reviews that people were complaining about having to wait forever for a taxi. You will have to wait alittle longer because this hotel is slightly off the beaten track, but we never in the 4 days we were there waited more than 10 minutes.You may want to call or go downstairs to let the front desk know ahead of time that you need a taxi only if you are insistant that a taxi is there for you right away when you come downstairs.We would definetly stay at Embassy Suites again if there is one available in the area of our next trip location."
96,329,"Oct 3 2005	Very Typical Embassy....	I am a Hilton chain kind of traveler, Diamond to be exact, and this property is about what i come to expect for Embassy Suites.... it is overall clean and acceptably maintained, yet nickel and diming at every opportunity, for instance the business center and internet access is over priced. They use the same internet provider as McDonald's which is free wireless at Ronald's with a happy meal purchase (about 100yards up the road) also, Sprint provides free wifi access at the mono rail station for the true junkie.Downside to this adventure is the location for other than conventions. There is no shuttle service and it is a hike to even the monorail about a mile up the road. The tourist maps suggest the strip is a block away, and yep... it's a really LONG block. Cab rides from/to anywhere are 10 bucks minimum with tip, and getting a cab to the hotel at times is quite a challenge.Upside is the price was on the lower end for this time of year, the breakfast bar was well stocked with variety and plentiful fresh food. For me, this being a non gaming property, it was quiet and peaceful after coming in to get more money from the lock box.If I were asked, would I stay here again (even when the last night/morning there was NO! hot water), I would never say never. For conventions it is a decent location, but for pleasure, I would pick another property."
97,329,"Sep 17 2005	Good week at E.S.	We chose to stay at E.S. since we were going to be in Vegas for a week and prefer a little more room. The rooms were clean, decorated nicely, had comfortable beds and fluffy towels. The cooked to order breakfast is a nice plus. Area was kept very clean, there were enough tables, food was attractive and well prepared. I would have liked a little more variety day to day, but there were really plenty of choices. This hotel has high-speed internet access in the rooms and we were given the option of purchasing access for the week at a reduced rate. Nice! The business center was having some technical difficulties, but the staff at the desk was glad to help, and in fact faxed some things for me. Gloria was especially helpful. There was a problem with the door to our room. The desk clerk seemed to think it was operator error, but maintainence was called and a very nice man was able to fix the problem (batteries in the reader). We had a room facing the front which had very nice views of the Strip and mountains. For business, this is a very good choice."
98,329,Aug 25 2005	Great off Strip Hotel	Stayed here for 4 nights.Room was much larger than the average Embassy Suites on the 7th floor with great views of the valley.Breakfast was well organised and not too crowded.Check-in was swift and staff were professional and accomodating.The only negative aspect about this hotel is the small indoor swimming pool but you don't ususlly go to Vegas to spend time in the pool!Given the opportunity I will most likely stay here again.
99,329,"Jul 14 2005	Better than the Rio	We have stayed at the Rio maybe six times in the last ten years. However we just spent one night at the Embassy Suites at the Las Vegas Convention Center and they have my business from now on. The price was lower ($139 versus over $200 for a Saturday night). They let us book for only one night instead of an obligatory two on the weekend. We were passing through Vegas on our way from Colorado back home to southern California.We love Embassy Suites anyway because we have two kids (14 and 9) and really enjoy the separate rooms and TV's, the breakfast and happy hour. We actually ended up at the wrong Embassy Suites because there are two within a mile of each other. The atrium is very pretty and our room on the 10th floor had a great view of the city. The problem, for some, is that there is no casino on site, no shows or Voodoo lounge. But you don't have to walk through 20 minutes of lobby to get to your car and the check in took 2 minutes rather than 30 minutes of waiting in line. The Rio Suites are not real suites but just a bigger room. I do like their sandy bottom pool versus the indoor pool of the Embassy Suites."
100,329,"Jun 12 2005 	I will never stay on the strip again!!	The Embassy Suites was wonderful. Great breakfast buffet with cooked to order eggs, great pool and jacuzzi, and the happy hour was a nice touch. The room was great. We were on the 10th floor, overlooking the airport to the south. (Lots of private jets coming and going!!) The bed was comfortable. The suite was roomy. We had no problem with the room being made up early, as was stated by another reviewer. My only complaint was that the internet is wired and cost $10.00 per day. Wireless is only available on the first floor. Just a note, it is NOT close enough to easily walk to the strip. We had a car and the parking lot was fine and well lit. It was a very short drive to the strip. I will definitely stay there every time I go to Vegas."
101,329,May 19 2005 	Not bad for the money	Stayed ther on busines for one night in April. Basically an average Embassy hotel. Comes with the standard suite room and complimentary breakfast which was fine. I'm Diamond VIP at Hilton so I don't know if I got an upgraded room or not. The room condition was fine. The downside for those who aren't familiar with Vegas is the area. The hotel is in a seedy part of Paradise Road. Need to excercise caution when walking around the area. Its also not on the regular cab routes so I waited about 15 minutes for a cab in the morning and ended up grabbing one that had just dropped off a faire.
102,329,"May 16 2005	Great place but too much trouble to get to the Strip	We just returned from a 2-night stay here. It was a nice hotel, good-sized rooms, and yes, a GREAT breakfast, complete with a friendly singing chef. However, if your intention is to come here and &quot;run over&quot; to the Strip, think again. We had tickets to a show at 8 and spent an hour trying to get a taxi from this hotel! The front desk was very unresponsive, shrugging and saying that this is how it &quot;always is&quot;, particularly on a Friday or Saturday night. They said they'd call a taxi, but none came. The only ones we did see were dropping off people coming in from the airport. A group of us ended up in front of the hotel, competing for the rare cab that did show up. It was awkward having people vie for a taxi! (We were here first/we have tickets/my aunt is waiting for us, blah, blah, blah) We ended up walking to the monorail, but it is not what you want to do when you are all dressed up and don't want to arrive all sweaty. The scene was repeated again on Saturday night. We finally went next door to the Best Western and THEIR staff got us a taxi. Next time, we will spend the extra money and stay on the Strip. The monorail is too far to walk at night, particularly in heels and if you are a woman, but is a good option if you don't mind walking a bit. This hotel needs to partner with their hotel neighbors and get a shuttle. We almost missed our plane today trying to get a taxi. It didn't work for us at all, which is a shame because everything else about the hotel was perfect."
103,329,May 11 2005	Nice conveniently located	We were there on business at the Sands Convention Center which was only a few blocks away. The cook-to-order breakfast was good and plentiful. The best part was the honesty and helpfulness of the staff when I left 2 bags of jewelry worth several hundred dollare and several items of clothing. They found everything and sent it off the next day! I was so thankful for their efficiency and integrity. You can be sure that we will stay there on our next trip!
104,329,"Apr 26 2005 	Always consistent	Regarding the previous posting by the person who was upset because the hotel did not have the beds made until 4 or 5pm.... quit being so nit-picky! These are not your motel 6 sized rooms here.... they take a lot of extra time in each room so, yes, it DOES take extra time to do each floor.... they are doing the empty rooms ( vacated ) first so that these can be turned around for arrivals. Standard procedure in any hotel. Give them a 2 rating just for that? Sheesh. I have absolutely no reservations about recommending this hotel to anyone. It is a first rate place, and I come back to it even if the stay is not work related. I send out 30 employees to this hotel for 11 days each April for the last 4 years and have never, never, never had a single problem with this hotel. Guest services has always been curteous and kind, the breakfasts are excellent, the evenings' free drink get together is always pleasant. AND, since there are not any slots in the building, there is NOT the constant ding-ding-ding of slot machines! Only complaint is that getting a taxi sometimes is a pain since they are off the strip. Plan ahead by about 30 minutes since it takes that long to get a taxi to the hotel, especially on a Friday or Saturday evening....in which case you can usually expect a 45 minute wait. The new monorail has an access point a 5 minute walk away in front of the convention center, so for $3, it's a lot easier to get to the strip than taxi. $3 back as well, or you can buy a day or weekend pass."
105,329,Apr 24 2005	Great rooms Bad Service	Stayed at the Embassy Suites for a long weekend. We liked the hotel but found the services to be disappointing at best. Rooms were left unmade until 4 or 5 pm when we'd left the room before 9:00am. Was told by Guest Services that they were fully booked and would get to us after they finished the rooms that were empty....Huh??????Unfortunate as the bedding was very nice. Wouldn't stay here again......
106,329,"Mar 19 2005	Great Stay	Last November we spent four nights at this hotel. I loved it, great room, free full breakfast and easy parking."
107,329,"Mar 17 2005	Convenient and Family Friendly	We just returned from our trip to Hawaii via Las Vegas. On the way out we stayed at the Embassy Suites Convention Center - it was perfect. With four children, we quite often stay at Embassy Suites, and although this was one of the smaller suites we have stayed in, it had the usual exceptional amenities. It was clean, quiet, and away from the strip - a bonus in our opinion. The breakfast is always a treat, and in this case the food was fresh with quite a variety of choices. Staff was helpful and friendly. A very good value for families."
108,329,"Jan 3 2005	one night at Embassy Suites	We stayed one night at the Embassy Suites Convention Centre on Dec. 30. The internet rate was only $76.00 including breakfast. The value for that date was outstanding, considering that the strip hotels had already boosted their rates for new year's. The suite was spacious and clean, and even had a small balcony with a view of the monorail and the strip. Breakfast was almost as good as the buffet we had the day previous at Treasure Island."
109,329,"Dec 26 2004	Great for those with children and savings on breakfast	What an excellent choice we made. We stayed at both of these great hotels. The one closer to the airport was a lot nicer and newer. Our room was very good and the breakfast saved us from having to take our three grandchildren out every morning. The breakfast buffet was beyond our belief. What a great assortment and if they didn't have it made, they graciously cooked whatever we wanted to our specifications. Didn't have to take the little ones through all the crowded mobs in the bigger gambling casinos. The one closer to the airport is within a block of the Hard Rock and another casino so we could just walk there. Would take us to the strip and pick us up. Didn't even need a car. Beds very comfortable and room for more people on the queen couch-comfortable also. Great vacation. Thanks to the Embassy Suites staff."
110,329,"Dec 10 2004	Nice choice off strip	Just returned from four nights at the Embassy Suites, Convention Center. Room was quiet, clean, comfortable and spacious. Our room had a small balcony so I was able to get some fresh air. I always find that hotel rooms can be rather stale so I like to be able to open a window or slider. If you like fresh air ask for a balcony room as the others had windows that didn't open. Breakfast was fine; typical of this type of hotel. The free managers' cocktail hour was nice. Staff was helpful with directions and maps. This hotel is a little too far to walk to the Strip. We had a car and drove to one of the big casino hotels, parked our car and walked portions of the Strip. Unfortunately the monorail, which is just down the street, was not operational yet. This was our first stay at an Embassy Suites and we would definately consider staying at another one."
111,329,"Nov 10 2004 	Nice non gaming respite!	We enjoyed the restful nature of this non gaming hotel. It was only a couple of blocks from the strip but after a day of running arround is was a pleasure to return each afternoon to the quiet mesmorizing fountain atruim and our very clean, quiet, non smoking room. It was our first visit to Las Vegas so we had much to see and do. My husband attended a conference at the Riveria, which he was able to walked to each morning. My 4 year old loved our view of the strip as the lights came up each evening! The cooked to order breakfast was more that adequate each morning, it featured quick and healthy choices for all. My only complaint, I had to request more towels each day, there were 4 of us in the suite for 3 nights and only 3 sets of towels, and Sunday, our room was not cleaned until we had already returned from the day's activities, about 4 pm. The pool was small but not crowded and great for burning off extra &quot;kid&quot; energy from the long drive."
112,329,"Nov 3 2004	Not bad...but not the Ritz either.	Overall, this was a decent hotel. The lobby is nicely done with an open atrium style. The cooked-to-order breakfast was ok (not dog food, but not gourmet either). We requested a room with a view of &quot;the strip&quot; and we got that. We also requested a non-smoking room...but it smelled quite a bit of cigarette smoke. But the room was nicely furnished and decorated. The bathroom was essentially spotless. While a rare incident, I must tell you that the fire alarm went off at 3AM (the hotel was crawling with kids competing in some baseball tournament. We suspect one or more of them are responsible for the alarm going off). Being an atrium style hotel, &quot;group psychology&quot; set in (meaning that people walked out into the walkways on each floor and watched everyone on all the other floors standing around. No staff bothered to tell people to get out, stay put, or anything for that matter. They wouldn't even answer the front desk phone (where they were standing...we had a clear view of them from our room). People waited over 15-20 minutes before an announcement was made that it was a false alarm. Had it been a real fire, the results could have been tragic! (But it was equally foolish for people to stand around their rooms when the fire alarm was going off also). Again, a rare incident (I would imagine), but not one that brings about a &quot;warm, fuzzy feeling&quot; on the part of how staff are viewed."
113,329,"Aug 5 2004	Excellent value	This was the first time we have stayed in Embassy Suites accommodation but it won't be the last. The rooms were spacious and clean. General facilities were very good though the pool is a little on the small side. Complimentary breakfast is excellent. Staff very courteous and helpful. Location may not suit all - its off-strip but only about a 5 min walk to the monorail if you chose not to use the complimentary shuttle. If you want to keep away from the hustle &amp; bustle of the Strip, consider this place."
114,329,Jul 18 2004	Would stay there again!	We stayed at the Embassy Suites Convention Ctr July 1 &amp; 2nd. This hotel is part of the Hilton chain and it shows. The suites are beautifully decorated and impeccable. The whole hotel smells clean. There is no casino in the hotel so it is relaxing and quiet. The staff was very helpfull.The generous all you can eat breakfast (included) is delicious! The only negative part would be the pool. It is a small indoor pool with nothing special compared to other pools we've seen in other Las Vegas hotels..I would definetly recommend this hotel at the $87/night rate that we got.
115,329,Jul 18 2004	Not as quiet as anticipated	I thought the Embassy Suites would cater more to business travelers but the weekends were packed with family reunions and the weekdays were still busy with family travelers. The rooms all face the inside lobby and people often shout from floor to floor. The morning &quot;Cook to order&quot; breakfast was very good and had a large variety of foods. The staff was nice and helpful and the rooms were generally clean. There is a nightly manager's reception in the 3rd floor bar area which also overlooks the lobby and adds to the noise level after a busy day. The indoor pool is located on the 1st floor so the smell of chlorine is powerful at times and you can hear the kids screaming from the pool area. (My room was located on the 4th floor so may be quiter if you get a higher floor???)
116,329,"Jul 6 2004	An excellent choice	We held our family reunion (13 rooms) at this hotel the weekend of June 25-27. they gave us what we considered a very fair rate, considering that it was a weekend. We were very pleased, as the suites were clean and pleasant; the complimentary breakfast was excellent; and the staff was very accommodating. The lobby is beautiful and was a great place for various members of our family to gather and visit informally. My husband and I also had lunch at the on site restaurant two afternoons, and thought it was good. This hotel is away from the noise and crowds of the Strip, yet close enough to go there easily. The only negative is that the pool is indoors, and is small. However there is an outdoor spa.It is hard to please all members of such a diverse group as our, but that is exactly what happened. Everyone agreed that this was a good choice, and a key component in the success of our reunion. I definitely would recommend this hotel to any individual, family or group."
117,329,Jul 3 2004	An excellent choice
118,329,Jul 1 2004 	A Nice Surprise
119,329,Jun 4 2004	Nice Place Consider Staying Here for a Convention
120,329,May 9 2004	Bluefish Reunion
121,329,Apr 30 2004	One of best stays in Vegas!
122,329,Apr 19 2004	Happy with this choice
123,329,Apr 2 2004	Close to the convention center
124,329,Jan 5 2004	Read all the fine prints
125,329,Aug 6 2003	very enjoyable hotel.
126,329,Jul 20 2003	Very good choice
127,329,Sep 23 2007 	super Alternative zu den Strip-Hotels
1,339,Oct 8 2009 	Excellent value off the strip	Very nice hotel if you are looking to stay off the strip. We were there for just one night before our early morning flight so worked fine. Nice included breakfast which is nice.
2,339,"Sep 7 2009 	If Just Passing Through: STAY HERE	We were on a canyons tour (which was spectacular by-the-way, and stayed here only one night for an easy trip to the airport. It was great. Comfortable, quiet room with a mini fridge and a micro, easy courteous check-in, and the usual breakfast bar. The bed was very comfortable. Best of all they have a shuttle, and they picked us up at the airport after we returned the rental car and delivered us back in the morning. Also, within easy walking distance were many nice restaurants. We avoided all the crazyiness of the strip - but it's not far away if that's what you're into."
3,339,"Aug 9 2009 	Clean nice lobby 	Hotel was clean with a nice and helpful staff. We had to check out of South Point Hotel Casino &amp; Spa for two days during our trip due to them being booked solid, so we chose this Fairfield Inn. I may just be spoiled by the rooms/facility at South Point, but I was pretty disappointed when we came here. The rooms with double beds were very small. The double beds almost seemed as though they were twin beds. The bathroom was very tiny too. There were only one set of elevators that at one point only one was working. I would pay a bit more money to stay somewhere else. The lobby and the breakfast was also nice."
4,339,"Jul 5 2009 	Short stop-over	Pre-booked this as we needed a stop-over on the way to California. The hotel was easy to find and had good parking, it is about a mile from the strip and in the temperatures here walking is out, so we were pleased to discover that the hotel has a free shuttle. The shuttle runs on demand to and from the strip, just ring them when you need to return. It runs until 11pm after that a taxi costs abut $9 from the strip.The hotel did NOT inform us about the shuttle on check in, it was only when I asked what was the best way to the strip that I was told about it! Also on the website it says the hotel has a laundry IT DOES NOT you can however use the laundry in the adjacent Mariott free of charge. The pool was small but OK and the brekfast was also typicall of Mariott, nice clean place to stay. Baham Breeze within walking distance"
5,339,"Jun 30 2009	Even at 5:30 a.m. we were greeted with a smile	We came to Vegas for a basketball tournament with a team of teenage boys and their families. This was the perfect location, as it was just a short drive to show the kids the lights on the Vegas strip at night. To avoid a lot of the Vegas &quot;riff-raff', I recommend a visit to the Circus Circus amusement park and their all-you-can-eat buffet for the kids...they loved it, and didnt have to see all the more &quot;adult-oriented&quot; Vegas sights. Coming back to the Fairfield was comforting as we were always welcomed back with a friendly &quot;hello&quot; by the front desk staff. The rooms were very clean and had just what we needed..nothing fancy. There was always coffee available, and the &quot;egg-sandwiches&quot; and freshly made waffles were a hit with the boys. Early in the mornings another Mom and myself would head out at 5:30 a.m. for a brisk one hour walk to the Strip and back, and we were always greeted with a &quot;Good Morning!!!&quot; and a smile by the front desk staff. I would definitely return!"
6,339,"Jun 9 2009 	Perfect if you don't need the Strip buzz	We have stayed in Vegas on previous occasions. To be in the centre of things and soak up the whole &quot;Vegas Experience&quot; we recommend staying in one of the large Strip hotels. However, this time we were flying in and leaving next morning for Southern Utah. This was a perfect hotel for us - a few minutes from the Airport car rental place. Large and very clean bedroom and bathroom, comfortable bed, perfectly adequate continental breakfast and efficient desk staff when checking in and out."
7,339,May 12 2009 	very clean	us air had to pay for us a room so they sent us to fairfield inn.i was surprised at how clean this motel was.we were way off the strip. we went to mcdonalds for burgers. the 7-11 for beer.back to the room to (veggie out)watch tv.next thim we come to vegas we will stay here and rent a car.the staff was great but they need to remember everyone dont drink coffee so turn on the juice mach.
8,339,"Apr 12 2009 	Great Staff and Nice Stay	We stayed only one night as I had a free night on Marriott Rewards. The free shuttle from the airport was perfect and the driver was really accomodating. After checking in, he took us to the Strip for free. The front desk was quick on chekc in and gave us free bottled waters. Great service. The next day they called a cab for us when checking out, a very short wait. Their location is not too bad, there are a couple of smaller casinos close by and restaurants."
9,339,"Dec 20 2008	Friendly Front Desk	It was a nice clean hotel with absolutely friendly front desk and hotel personnel. This is one of the few Fairfield Inns that I stayed at that I can really rave about the friendliness of all of the personnel. The only two problems I saw are the water from the sink and bathtub drained very slowly in my room, and the guest computers down in the lobby area had problems loading up files, so one would sit waiting a few minutes for each display to come up."
10,339,"Dec 5 2008 	Nice stay off of the strip	This hotel was off the strip, on Paradise Road, and the traffic was much easier to negotiate. We stayed only one night. The hotel and room were very clean and comfortable. The ladies at the front desk were very helpful, and answered all our questions and concerns. Breakfast was good, and it was nice to have some meat items in addition to pastries, etc. We didn't get to use the fitness room, but it was filled with many aerobic machines - treatmills, bikes, etc. The only thing that I noticed that I didn't like was that the jets in the outdoor hottub were not very forceful, and the tub was shallow. Those are small complaints. The stay was nice, and we would stay again at this Fairfield."
11,339,Oct 20 2008 	Loved staying at Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport	Stayed at hotel during EMS Expo convention for five days from Duke University Medical Center. Staff was very friendly at desk and always said hello when passing the front desk. Housekeeping staff done an outstanding job in making sure the room was neat and cleaned. The older gentlemen who shuttle me to the convention center and airport was very friendly. He made me feel welcome in Las Vegas. I would stay there again if visiting Las Vegas again.
12,339,"Aug 31 2008 	Can't ask for more	As the previous 10 reviews say, it is clean and comfortable and worth more than what you paid for. There is none of that unpleasant cigarette smell as Marriott hotels are smoke free. I love the unlimited free breakfast which has already thinned down at the La Quinta which is in the same category as this hotel. The room may be a bit cramped but it is still OK. The hotel is a bit older compared to the other Fairfield Inn at the other side of I-15."
13,339,"Jul 9 2008 	Quiet Clean Close to Strip INCOMPETENT front desk workers!	I liked everything about this hotel except for the front desk staff. The breakfast was delicious and always had a hot special (not just cold cereal and donuts). When I stayed it was apple cinnamon waffles and they were great. The room itself was quite comfortable and clean. The whole stay was very quiet with no loud guests or children in the hallway. There was a pretty, clean pool right outside our window, but nobody was ever swimming in it. The hotel was very close to the strip, but not so close as to be annoying. It was a quick walk across a nice palm-tree lined street. There were also some good restaurants between the hotel and the strip: Bahama Breeze and Cozymels. The shuttle drivers were friendly and prompt, but that was where my happiness with the staff ended.The front desk workers almost made us miss the second half of our trip (which was a bus ride to Los Angeles and two days at Manhattan Beach). We packed our things on our last day, called down to the front desk almost an hour before our bus was set to leave and asked them to call us a cab (believe me, we would have called ourselves, but the hotel staff TOLD us that they prefer it when the hotel themself calls--as they know the proper coordinates to go to, etc). They said they would call them and that we should come down about 10 minutes before we needed to leave to wait for the cab. Well, we came down when they told us to and they hadn't even CALLED the cab yet. They called them THEN when we needed to LEAVE then and they told us to wait outside for them. So we go out in the 100 degree heat and wait...and wait...and wait some more. I went back in three times to ask if they had any info on where the cab was as we waited for FORTY FIVE minutes! When the cab finally arrived we were pretty irate, both with the desk workers and with the cab driver for being so late after the first call, but what really got us was when the bus driver told us that each time we went in to tell the front desk that we were still waiting, they would call the cab company and request ANOTHER cab! Not call and ask them where our cab was. So they were just causing confusion and suspicion at the cab company as we were moving down and down and down the list. The cab driver said that all they needed to do to get them to come straight to us was to SAY that we had a bus to catch and were in a hurry. But did they do that? NO! They just kept calling and making NEW requests for cabs! Not emphasizing the need for the first cab.Basically, the hotel stay was nice, it was LEAVING the hotel that was the problem. If you stay here, just call your own cabs and don't listen to anything the front desk staff says!"
14,339,"Apr 10 2008 	Great Value good service	This hotel is off-strip, quiet and comfortable. A good place to relax after the hustle and bussle of the major attractions. The hotel was clean and well kept, the staff were friendly and very helpful. The complimentary breakfast, internet access, bus service and local phone calls were an added attraction. Very good value for money, would definitely stay there again."
15,339,"Nov 1 2007	Good place to stay	Stayed here for two days while on a little birthday celebration trip. Opted for the Fairfield instead of a Strip hotel because I booked two rooms and wanted my Rewards points for spending the money. The lobby and adjoining breakfast room is nicer than most Fairfield Inns. Although the free breakfast did not have any eggs or bacon, it was very good with a variety of selections and an attendant who constantly insured an ample supply. Food serivce area and tables were very clean.There are two computers with large flat screen monitors and a printer in the breakfast area for free use by guests.The rooms are nicely furnished-a bit nicer and more substantial than mosty Fairfields. Free internet in the room. Room was quiet and comfortable.There is a courtesy van for the Airport and the hotel is 5 minutes from the Strip so if you want the excitement of the Strip and the casinos, it is very close by.Bottom line-if you are looking for a room less costly than the Strip or want the quiet of a non-casino hotel, you can't go wrong staying here. There really was nothing negative."
16,339,"Aug 8 2007 	A very nice place to sleep - nice breakfast.	This is NOT a resort. It's a very nice place to sleep with comfortable beds and a very nice breadfast included for what we think is a reasonable price. We had a king room on a Thrusday night for $110, senior rate. Far from the strip? What, were you walking? It's about 4 blocks - drive over to the strip and park in the free parking that all the resorts offer. Easy check in - no lines. Same with check out. Close enough to be convient but away from the noise and crowds of the strip. A very nice breakfast including &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; waffles if you'd like. Its called &quot;airport&quot; because there are 2 Fairfield Inns in Las Vegas and it's the one that's nearest to the airport, but don't let that concern you for one minute. It's NOT that close. It's parallel to the main &quot;going&quot; area of the strip, just about 4 blocks south(?) - I always get my directions mixed up there. It's in a nice area and we think it's a good choice for an overnight stay in Vegas. Fairfield Inns are primarily designed for business travelers, but we often choose them and have usually been very happy."
17,339,Apr 17 2007 	Nice Hotel	Nice hotel but far from the strip. Great staff. So so breakfast. Do yourself a favor and stay on the strip
18,339,"Feb 13 2007 	You can do better then this....	The first thing I want to mention is that the Fairfield Inn is a clean, nice place to stay. Ok.That's all the nice things I can say about it. Now here goes. The Fairfield Inn is BORING with a capital B. No restaurants, no bar, no casino, no nothing. The hotel has only 4 floors and has no views. As with most Las Vegas hotels, it has limited TV selections and expensive Pay-per-view offerings. But in the hotel's defense, it does have a daily continental breakfast .(Yawn)I spent 12 days there while working at the Las Vegas Convention Center and I couldn't even get a refrigerator in my room. They kept tellng me that I was first on the list to get the next available one. After 7 days of that, I realized that I was being lied to by the staff. It is very difficult to stay at a hotel for 12 days and not be able to have any snacks or drinks in your room. I can't believe that the Marriott Hotel chain can't afford to add a few more refrigerators to their rooms. To me, this is an absolute neccessity.By the way, this hotel has no King beds. (according to the staff) All rooms come with 2 double beds. Another wierd thing about this hotel is that it is all completely non-smoking. (All Marriott Hotels have gone 100% non-smoking) I don't smoke so that does not bother me so much. What does bother me is the extremes that this hotel goes through to keep people from smoking in their rooms. They went to the extent of screwing shut the windows, disabling the bathroom exhaust fan and the worst thing is that the room door has a gap at the bottom of the door at least 1 and 1/2 inches high. You can see and here anyone that walks past your room. That is bordering on paranoia if you ask me.The Fairfield Inn is not real inexpensive either. The rates are comparable to a lot of the casino hotels that have much more to offer.It's not that I don't recommend this hotel but certainly you can do better for the price. If you are going to Vegas, find a hotel that allows you to have a little fun and won't lie to you."
19,339,Nov 9 2006	Not bad	Clean and comfortable room. Staff was friendly. Nice business center. Typical chain breakfast buffet - nothing to get excited about. A bit pricey for what you get.
20,339,"Nov 3 2006	Nice alternative to the strip	Stayed here vs. the strip due to expensive rooms because of a large conference in town. Not far from the strip. Room was very nice, although SMALL. Bathroom was a bit cramped with not much counter space. Smoke-free hotel. Free internet. Adequate parking. Only complaint was no restaurant. If you're unable to stay on the strip, this is a good alternative."
21,339,"Sep 25 2006 	Great quite off the Strip	What a nice find in Las Vegas. If you want a quite proptery, off the strip. This is it. The property was small and quite. Nice free breakfast. The bed was amazing, complete with down pillows. The bathroom was very nice with plenty of towels. The room also had free internet. The staff was very nice and friendly. There was also a free shuttle to and from the airport.Will stay here again!"
22,339,"Jun 30 2006	A refuge!	We spent a night here after our connecting flight home to Denver was cancelled and it was truly a refuge for weary travelers! A $10 cab ride from the airport. The room was plenty big enough for 2 adults and 2 teenagers, comfortable beds, nice and quiet location. The breakfast really impressed us as we are used to continental breakfasts that consist of little more than donuts and coffee. We feasted on the waffles, bagels, cereal, boiled eggs, pastries, Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches, great coffee, and fruit!The free internet station was invaluable to us in our efforts to get home. Just wish we'd had time to visit the Strip. Maybe next time. I would definitely stay here again."
23,339,"Apr 22 2006	A good stay	I stayed at this hotel for two nights over a weekend. It was a good stay. The breakfast was the typical Marriott Fairfiled standard- with cereal, bagels, yogurt, milk, chocolate milk, juices, make your own waffles, and more. The room was nicely sized, and I loved how the bathroom was laid out. The only thing I noticed ws the the TV seemed to have fewer channels than most other Fairfield Inns have-- (ie: no Comedy Cental, but still more channels than most other hotel chains seem to offer). Since I wasn't in Vegas over the weekend to watch TV, it did not bug me at all.The walk to the strip is about a mile each way, which was fine for me since I like to get exercise and it was 74 sunny degress outside during my stay. If you want to spend most of your time on the strip, this hotel is a good choice so long as you aren't planning on doing the walk during the hot summer months (or if you have a rental car anytime).For a cheap lunch, be sure to go to Pennytown @ the Riveria casino. Just about everything is &lt; $1, including foot long hotdogs, giant cookies, cheesecake, etc.We had dinner one night at the Bahama restaurant a few blocks directly South of the hotel, and that was really good.Overall, I would stay here again."
24,339,"Mar 28 2006	Great stay exceeded expectations!	I was looking for a hotel near the Strip, but without the astronomical Strip prices. And since Fairfield Inns are marketed as the Marriott for the budget traveler, I was expecting something along the lines of motel-like accommodations and service when I booked my stay at the Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised by the experience.The lobby area is newly updated with a contemporary feel, next to a divided eating area where breakfast is served. The receptionists were polite and greeted us whenever we passed by the lobby area.The rooms are a bit on the small size, designed for the business traveler rather than a family with kids in tow. Nevertheless, my room was very clean (the most important criteria in my book!) and the rooms make efficient use of space with a wardrobe instead of a closet, a corner sink in the bathroom with cubby holes for towels, and a curved shower curtain rod that gives the impression of more space in the tub. My one complaint about the bathroom is that there are no towel racks since I like to reuse my towels to save water. However, housekeeping replenishes towels daily. Other postings have mentioned a large gap at the bottom of the door that lets noise in. There is indeed a half inch gap, but I was not bothered by any noise at allit must have been a quiet night.Like the lobby area, the rooms are simply but stylishly redone in warm yellows and greens. The beds were decent to sleep on and feather pillows are provided. And while the beds are made very appealingly using a three-sheet setup, the hotel does not use standard bedspreads-- only a &quot;table-runner&quot; sized bedspread that lies at the foot of the bed. I didnt quite get it, but the hotel was nice about providing an extra blanket when I asked for one.Other nice amenities the rooms provide are coffee, a hairdryer, an iron, and best of all, free wireless internet--all I needed to do was called the receptionist for the access code for the internet. Contrary to the previous posting, I thought that the free continental breakfast was quite good and had a nice selection of items that included danishes, muffins, donuts, French toast, English muffins, Quaker oats, Yoplait yogurt cups, individual sized cereals, hard boiled eggs, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, and several juices. The make-your-own waffle station was easy to use and an especially nice touch. A &quot;breakfast attendant&quot; was also on hand to restock items that were running out and was very helpful. Lastly, that Las Vegas airport is in the name of this hotel is misleading. It's not that close to the airport, but very convenient to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Strip (by car), which is one of the main reasons I chose it after looking up the location on Mapquest. The hotel is located near the back of the golf course of the new Wynn Resort.Overall, my experience at the Fairfield Inn was a good one. I believe that you get what you pay for at most places, but having stayed at many budget hotels like Best Western, Ramada, and Travelodge, I can honestly say that the Fairfield Inn exceeded my expectations for a budget hotel and Id definitely consider staying here again in the future."
25,339,"Mar 3 2006	DON'T STAY HERE	Stayed here in January, this has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. DO NOT STAY HERE. The staff were UN helpful rued and in polite,The rooms ok put the doors had huge gaps so not only you could here every one walking down corridor but also your neighbors.Breakfast was nothing to be desired, with moldy bagels.Was not impress at all would not stay here again."
26,339,"Aug 11 2005 	Exceeded expectations	I was very pleased with this hotel. I'm a total snob, and this place went beyond my expectations. Keeping business hotels under $100 a night is sometimes scary, but I will definitely stay here again. It has just been remodeled, so everything is very clean and the hotel staff were always very nice. The front desk people addressed me by name and the housekeepers were always polite when I saw them in the hallway. The hotel also provides free highspeed internet access in every room and has Wi-Fi in the lobby. Getting cabs is a total pain since it is off the strip (45 minute wait) and the cabdrivers pretty much refuse to reply when dispatchers ask them to leave the strip. They also pretend to be lost all the time in a city the size of a very small town. But if you ask very nicely and are appreciative (I suggest giving a generous tip to get them to do it more than once), the hotel's airport shuttle drivers will take you pretty much anywhere on the strip for free. Much better than the ridiculous cab rates that make NYC rates look dirt cheap. Honestly, even if you give the shuttle driver 10 bucks you'll have spent less than you would &quot;getting lost&quot; in a $20 cab. This hotel and their employees truly went beyond the call of duty to make sure I got to my trade show on time every morning. Highly recommended for business travelers!"
27,339,"Jul 6 2005	Fine	I stayed here for one night. Paid $80 for a room.Bad: This hotel is not near the Las Vegas Airport, and it is about 1.5 miles from the strip. Impossible to walk there in the Las Vegas heat. Budget for cabs.Good: Clean rooms, new amenities, solid free breakfast, nice staff.There was rennovation work going on at the hotel during my stay, but not near my room. Other guests probably suffered. Once rennovation is complete this disturbance will be moot. I think the Hard Rock hotel is within walking distance, but not too nearby."
28,339,"May 1 2005 	Great Convention Hotel	This is a great location if you are attending an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is a 12-minute walk north of the Fairfield. (Also, there is a Monorail stop across from the Convention Center to take you to the strip for $3.00). Clean hotel, friendly staff. Hallway was just finishing renovation - room was already finished. Has ironing board and iron. Rooms with 1 bed have a couch and more room; rooms with 2 beds - no couch. Rate includes high-speed Internet, and buffet breakfast (pour your own batter into waffle iron to make your own waffle). Hourly free trip to/from airport. In April 2004, I paid $129/$98/$169/$169 ($169 was the Special Event Rate because of the Convention - otherwise is the cheaper rates). I will stay here again.Note: If you are looking for a Convention hotel, the Best Western Mardi Gras is also very nice, usually a little cheaper than Fairfield, and is only 5 minutes south of the Convention Center."
29,339,"Apr 8 2005 	Great Value Great Location!	After reading the Dec. 2004 review of this hotel, I had to respond. I have stayed at the Fairfield Inn Las Vegas airport at least a dozen times. I travel to Vegas twice a year to attend a trade show and love the location because it is only a fifteen minute walk to the Sands Expo Center. This is a typical Fairfield Inn. It is an economy business hotel. I have always been treated well by the staff and the upkeep of the property is exactly what you would expect from Marriott. The hotel rooms were being updated when I was there, but it appeared they had the entire third floor closed for the rennovation so there was no disturbance in my first floor room. When the rennovation is complete it will make the Fairfield an even greater value. I suspect the individual who wrote the &quot;Just Say No&quot; review just had a bad experience, something that happens even at the best hotels occasionaly. I highly reccomend the Fairfield Inn on Paradise to those who hate casinos as much as I do and want a smaller quieter property off the strip and near the two major convention centers. In closing let me add that my bed came equipped with a nice bedspread, despite what was written by the earlier reviewer."
30,339,"Dec 9 2004	Just say no......	I have to tell you, I just returned from the Las Vegas Fairfield, and about all I can say, is that it was one of the worst hotels I have experienced. The floor I was on was under renovation, and had all of the wallpaper pulled down, and smelled of paint or some other chemical. Needless to say, it was dirty due to the construction. My room, was in dire need of renovation and was dirty as well. One of the strangest things was that the hotel did not have any bedspreads on my beds while some of the other rooms did. I inquired about this, and they said that they don't offer bedspreads anymore, only a &quot;3-sheet setup&quot;. My bed had only two sheets and a thin blanket. I have never stayed in a hotel in my life that did not offer a bedspread. I find this unacceptable, especially from a Marriot hotel. I believe that the hotel should have offered a discount due to the disruption and lack of cleanliness from the construction, but when I asked, none was given."
1,340,"Oct 25 2009 	Closet with a bed	The first time I stayed here the room was very nice, good size. Apparently this was an upgrade fluke. The room I had this time was a closet with a bed. You can get a much better and larger room at almost any of the casinos. Room was clean but not worth the money. Also NO SHUTTLE SERVICE. I was told at the desk that it's only a couple of miles to the airport that a taxi shouldn't cost too much."
2,340,"Feb 26 2009 	Close to I-15 free Internet (a big deal in Las Vegas!)	This hotel was very good. If had free internet access in the rooms, with two computers downstairs that you could use to print; a big deal considering the fact that our friends who were at the Stratosphere at the Strip were paying $12 a day, and they were there for a whole week! We had a rental car, but there was a shuttle van, and the hotel is located opposite the southern end of the Strip. The rooms were remarkably clean, and showers immaculate. The front desk staff was exceptional, and parking was easily accessible. We did not know that parking is free in Las Vegas, which is amazing if you live on the East Coast! Would visit again!"
3,340,"Sep 30 2008 	HVAC problem	I have stayed at other Fairfield Inns and decided to give the Fairfield Inn South a try when I was in Vegas for a long weekend. I am sorry to say that I don't plan on staying here again and this is why:Being the end of September, it was still in the high 90s during the day and the high 70s/low 80s at night. This meant that I needed the air conditioning on in my room. The problem is, either you are in the North Pole or the Sahara Desert - no in between. The HVAC unit on the floor is right next to the bed.Not only it is very noisy when it is on, there are no dials on the unit for high cool/low cool, high fan/low fan or whatever.All there is is a thermostat unit on the wall. The thermostat has a button for on or auto, and one for heat/cool/off. No high/low fan button. And you can adjust the temperature with the little up/down arrows. Here lies the problem -because you can't put the fan on high or low the unit only has 1 function - blow freezing cold Arctic air out at a high rate and when the room cools to the temperature on the thermostat, it shuts off. No low fan to run. Therefore you are either freezing or boiling in the room. No in between. I got very little sleep the 2 nights I was there because I was up constantly all night adjusting the thermostat. It was terrible!! I would never stay at this hotel again unless they add a high/low button to the thermostat.Other than the HVAC problem and the fact that the bed was right next to the unit (maybe 2 feet from it!) , the hotel was fine. The room was very small but they managed to have a big desk with plenty of room on it and a little armchair &amp; footstool. Small closet. The king size bed was fabulous as were the wonderful feather pillows. The staff were all very nice and the breakfast was good. There was plenty of hot water and good water pressure.I did not have a suite, I just had a standard room. I did not hear any planes overhead (yes, the hotel is fairly close to the airport runways but so are the Mandalay Bay &amp; many other strip hotels!) perhaps because the noisy HVAC unitl drowned them out! and I did not notice any smell in the hallways."
4,340,"Mar 27 2008 	Fairfield Inn 	Had a fantastic last minute booking/stay at this Fairfield just south of the LV strip, and got a great price for my last minute effort. Extremely friendly staff, extremely comfortable bedding, and a great breakfast. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here if we ever went back. It was in a great location if you wanted to be close to the strip but not right on the strip. Fantastic facility!"
5,340,"Jan 22 2007	Fantastic Place To stay	We stayed at the resort on the 7th Jan. and just loved the place. Everything was so professional from the front desk to the quality of the room. Our room was a twin suite in the main building. I have stayed in hotels all over the world from very basic to very comfortable and would rate this resort very highly . Our twin suite had two bathrooms one with a jacuzie. Three bedrooms two fully fitted kitchens four tellys all rooms were fitted with upmarket furntiure and fittings. In the centre of the resort were two very safe swimming pools and two heated jacuzies. Deck chairs, loungers and palm trees completed this area. At night this place was lit up which looked impressive. If you could improve this place I would reccomend a second shuttle bus the Aladin hotel is the nearest hotel on the strip but is still 10 mins walk away and late at night this could be awkward as the other shuttle bus is at the other end of the stip so if you are in the Luxor you are left with little options but to walk or get a cab which with tips and all could set you back 20 dollars a trip. Also the shop could be a bit better stocked. I know these are minors details but would be a big improvement to the quality of our stay. Overall I would highly reccomend this place."
6,340,"Sep 2 2006 	Beds were great. Room was clean.	The Fairfield Inn is located on a off the beaten path area of Las Vegas. This would be ok if it wasn't near where the planes take-off and land. The staff is terrific. My luggage did not arrive with the plane. I was dressed in a long sleeve shirt, and had no toiletries. The front desk person hooked me up with two Marriott T-shirt's, and a ton of supplies such as lotion, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. The hallways did smell funny and did not look very posh. The room itself was very nice. It was extremely clean, and did not smell at all. There is a Microwave, fridge, separate living room with a large TV, a huge bedroom with another TV, and a large bathroom with a strong water pressure shower. The bed was so comfortable I wanted to take it home.There is a huge negative to this hotel. It is very close to where the planes take-off and land. Unless you enjoy being woken up at 7:00am by the sound of jet engines, I would avoid this hotel."
7,340,"Apr 6 2006	Not recommended	My stay was for two nights. I don't recommend this place and here are the reasons:-The hallways smell like a skunk. When you turn on your ac, it pulls the smell into your room. Yuk! If you read reviews about this place, another poster mentioned this smell yet I booked because I saw more positive reviews than negative. This place is only a year or two old. -I was given a handicap room(shower stall)and when the water spilled out all over the bathroom after my shower, I requested a room change. The man at the front desk was annoyed, told me that there were no rooms to change to, instructed me to go back to my room and he will call me. After ten minutes, my husband went up front and luckily got the manager. The manager changed us to a different room. -I don't know why I was even given a handicap room to begin with. Neither my husband nor myself is physically challenged and when we were checking in, the front desk informed another guest that they DO HAVE rooms available and yet I was still given a handicap room. I won't stay here again."
8,340,"Apr 3 2006	Great Hotel One Small Problem	Stayed at the Fairfield Inn on April 1, 2006. Perfect Location, just a couple of blocks from the Mandalay Bay, close enough to the Strip without having to deal with the traffic of the Strip. Nice, clean spacious rooms, friendly staff. The only problem I had was the AC/Heating unit was very loud. I actually had to turn up the TV pretty loud to hear it over the AC/Heating unit. The unit did have a digital thermostat so you could set it just like your home thermostat. I left my room, set the unit to 80 degrees (it was cold in Vegas during my stay) so when I got back to my room it was nice and warm so I set it to 72 and went to bed without it coming back on as I slept."
9,340,Dec 24 2005 	Awesome	I stay in a lot of hotels and this place is awesome. The rooms are top-notch and the service is very professional. You really can't believe you are at a Marriott BUDGET property. You'd swear you are at a full-service Marriott.
10,340,"May 27 2005	Outstanding Hotel	My boyfriend &amp; I were attending a wedding in Vegas. All of the hotels were pretty expensive for the weekend we were going. Of course we wanted to stay on the strip but because of the prices we decided to stay at the Fairfield Marriott. My boyfriend &amp; have &quot;HIGH&quot; standards anywhere we stay &amp; try to get the best value for our $$. Our reservations were for the entire stay of our trip, but a few days before we left we found cheaper rates at The Excalibur so we canceled all but the 1st night. We did our research &amp; found that the hotel was still very new. When we arrived it was better than we even imagined. It was still very close to the strip &amp; we see all the hotels lit up. The lobby was very clean as well as the grounds around the hotel. The room was spectacular. It was like a mini apt. Everything was clean &amp; in great condition. We stayed in a King room, the front of the room was a little living room w/a hideaway sofa, TV. &amp; even a stereo complete w/cd &amp; cassette. The bed, linens &amp; pillows were &quot;VERY&quot; comfortable. Almost better than my own. There was also a 2nd TV in the area w/the bed. I was very upset that we canceled our other days &amp; was sad to go. This place was so much better than the Excalibur. The only downfall is its not on the strip &amp; there are no slot machines here, but were big gamblers. But none of that mattered. The staff was very friendly &amp; we were greeted each time we came in. I plan to stay here every time I'm in Vegas &amp; would recommend it to everyone. We were so impressed."
11,340,"Jan 26 2005	Nice Hotel	This hotel is only about a year old, it is very nice for a Fairfield. The lobby, and room decor are exceptional for a hotel of this class. We stayed in a suite with 2 double beds, it had a rather large bathroom, a nice seperate sitting area with pull out sofa, TV, stereo, desk and 2 chairs. The room is long and thin, but nicely arranged. Breakfast is included in the morning from 6am-10am and includes hot and cold cereals, all kinds of breakfast breads and pastries, fruit, waffels, juice, milk, yogurt etc., it was very good. Lobby staff ok never acknowledge you coming or going, had trouble finding our reservation in the computer too, not the friendliest people. You can hear airplanes here and there. The only real problem at this hotel is that the rooms get very warm unless you keep the air conditioning on (we were there in Jan. it was in the 40's at night), I can't imagine how bad it gets in the summer! The air conditioner is wall controlled and VERY noisy, we would set it low when we would leave the room and always found it back at 76 when we returned! Even with the air on only the bed area really cooled, the living room area where the pull out was stayed pretty warm! They have non-smoking rooms which was nice. The other problem I had was with the staff. When we left the hotel in the morning my daughter left her doll in the room, we know this because we walked straight from the room to the car. We didn't realize the doll was left until we were already on our way. I called the hotel and asked that they go get the doll so a friend could pick it up, I was told to call back. When I called back I was told they could not find the doll. I really don't think anyone looked, I even told them when they would find the doll. It would have just taken a minute to go up to the room and look. My daughter is still upset! Next time i'd drive back and look myself! Just don't leave anything behind and you'll be ok!"
12,340,"Apr 13 2004	Great stop excellent service and breakfast	For those who are traveling through Las Vegas to other destinations and do not want to stand in lines or be inconvenienced by the gambling atmosphere. This is a great choice to stay it is right off the freeway and easy to access with out traffic issues. The FairField Inn is a new building and very accommodating in the way of service and room layout. Fairfield Inn was a great stay for us on the way to California. In conclusion, I posted this comment to let others know of this hotel, since when I researched this hotel there were no comments. The only thing that I would consider an inconvenience is you can here planes fly over the hotel from time to time."
1,342,Jul 16 2009 	Nice Hotel	The Hotel is a nice hotel for the casino player. The rooms are good however We had a problem with unattended children in the next room at 0130am. when reported to the night manager she wasnt interested.
2,342,"May 29 2009 	This place is a dump	We went to Alliante which looked very nice. They were sold out, and the reservations department recommended Fiesta. Some guy who says &quot;God Bless You&quot; a lot named &quot;Miner&quot; told us the Fiesta was the nicest of all the Station Hotels. This was a big fat lie, and it was really late at night so we were tired and ready to sleep. The lady at the desk was rude and told us the water would be off for four hours. Between the bums and shady people hanging out it felt like we were in the GHETTO. The room was gross, tiny, and dirty. Not a nice place to stay at all. People say you get what you pay for, but if you go over to The Orleans the price is the same and very nice and not creepy and dirty at all. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE unless you like the GHETTO."
3,342,"Dec 20 2008 	Low Price but you Get What you Pay For	Fiesta Rancho is a hotel/casino in North Las Vegas, which is a fair distance away from the Strip. As a result, the room rates here are considerably lower than what you will find elsewhere in Vegas. Unfortunately, you pretty much get what you pay for with this place.The casino is in a rather low-rent section of the city, and the casino's parking structure is not even remotely close to the hotel. So you'll have to park your car outside in a rather iffy area, although they do have bicycle security that monitors the lots constantly.Rooms are fair at best. My heater didn't work, and I had to call somebody to repair it. The bathroom smelled moldy and unpleasant.Front desk was not very professional. Hung up on me after placing me on hold for over five minutes. Forgot to tell me basic information I needed before checking into the room. The lady who currently works at the desk has real problems speaking coherent English -- she just mumbles into the phone.Unlike other casinos, there is no breakfast buffet here, so you'll have to eat at the 24-hr Denny's if you're looking to eat before 11:00 or so. The casino itself is small and dingy compared to other local casinos. This place is an older casino, and pretty much looks it.My advice is to go the newer Texas Station casino across the street, which is ten times better than this place, and costs roughly about the same."
4,342,"Sep 1 2008 	filthy filthy filthy!!!!!	I should of taken the advice of past travelers... the hotel was old, smelly, dingy and depressing. We had a bad experience, for starters the shower floor was dirty with feet prints, the towels had rust stains, the sheets had dirt marks and their was a dead bug in our room.... stay away...."
5,342,Jul 10 2008 	they charge a seperate service fee for no service at all	they charge a seperate service fee for no service at allVery inconvenient location.hidden charges on phone calls.Front deck not helpful.Business center are not free.Food charge more than other hotels.
6,342,"Jun 14 2008 	Economic option for Vegas	Yes, this place is somewhat cheesy. The neighborhood isnt great. Over-the-top Eighties Rock pounded regularly in the casino. The rooms are plain and somewhat tacky. And the very faint scent of cigarette smoke could be found in the linens of a non-smoking room. But the prices are hard to beat. This is a great place to crash if youre just looking for an otherwise clean room with easy access to good food, a casino, and arent planning on spending a lot of time on the strip. The staff was relatively friendly at our 1:30 am check-in after arriving on a red-eye flight from Baltimore. The beds offer typical motel comfort. It seems as though the huge casino supports all other aspects of this propertys business. I'm not quite sure how they could support prices this low otherwise. Moreover, its hard to go anywhere in this place without walking through the casino. While there is a McDonalds in casino, the breakfast buffet was only $5 and offered a great assortment of well-prepared options. Overall, it was a pleasant short visit."
7,342,"Jun 1 2008 	Too far from the Strip	An OK hotel. The room is somewhat Spartan but suitable. However, the hotel is far from the city's attractions. If you have a car, or if you just wish to stay there to gamble, that's OK. But a trip to the Strip in taxi costs $60 return. The room price varies greatly depending on the date, from very cheap to pretty expensive."
8,342,"Apr 16 2008	You Get What You Pay For!	This hotel is in a bad part of Vegas. I felt unsafe walking from my car to the hotel and being in the hotel late at night, there were some shady characters. The rooms are old and had bricks for walls. The restaurants stay open late which is good and there is an ice skating rink also. The hotel is near the strip and highway. But I wouldn't stay at this hotel or recommend it."
9,342,"Apr 4 2008 	Great for off strip stay	Fiesta Rancho is located in north Las Vegas close to north LV airport and off strip.If you are taking a fly drive its a great option for a good priced hotel which still offers a full casino i(f thats what you are after) at a fraction of the cost of the strip hotels, while still being close enough to drive in to see the sights at night. The rooms are simple, clean and comfortable although be aware that unless you book a non smoking room ,(smoking is still permitted in ALL casino hotels) you may end up with a room that smells of smoke. Theres a hotel buffet offering a choice of american, mexican and eastern dishes at very reasonable prices, breakfast starts at $7, dinner $12. The Bahia cafe also does a lovely breakfast to order, portions are huge, the fresh fruit platter must weigh 2lb!!!, and still around $7 or less. Serivce was prompt and food lovely.If you have children with you there are the usual burger bars and a sub -way, this casino also has a seperate area with a few kids games, but better than this a full sized ice-rink is attached to the hotel and the local ice-hockey league plays there so you can always take a game in. Theres even a small pool area, although it was closed during our stay in early season.The location makes this great if you plan to drive out of vegas and do some sight seeing without getting tied up with the heavey traffic of the strip as the main freeway is easily accessed. The area also has many shopping malls and local resturants, again at less than the cost found on the strip. While this hotel does not have the sophisitcation of the strip hotels here is entertainment availble here, and also at the Texas Station resort next door. All in all this represents great value for money on a fly drive and still gives you the freedom to drive on to the strip and browse at your leisure."
10,342,"Feb 19 2008 	depends on why you are in Vegas	I go to Vegas often for conventions, entertainment, and visiting friends, although I am not a big Vegas fan. I had a coupon with Expedia and I just needed a bed for nephews soccer tournament. I hit a snare because it was the holiday weekend and I just needed a bed, knowing I would be spending zero time at the hotel. The hotel ended up costing about 50 bucks a night for Valentines/ Presidents weekend where the other rooms in town were way over a 200-500 bucks a night so I was happy. If you want the strip forget about it. It is too far despite the other reviews. Vegas traffic is a nightmare and where would you park? If you think you can stay here for cheaper and take a taxi forget it . Taxis are expensive in Vegas 10 dollars to go 1/2 mile and this hotel is 5 miles from strip. Those 5 miles took me 20-30 minutes to drive.Any money saved by hotel eaten by taxi/gas/parking fees. If you have a car, like I did it, it was aggravating getting along in the traffic. ( and hey I grew up in Ny so that is a pretty brazen statement. Vegas is Gridlock city! and just keeps getting worse every time I go) Ok now the good. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay, but not a dump, not in hookerville/drug town with a nice casino. stay here. The staff was the best I have ever had in Vegas, and I go there a lot. I was surprised at how nice everyone I met was. The only people that did not go gushing all over me were the McDonalds workers but they were still nice too.At one point I had two people helping me at once,Impressive! The room isn' t pretty, but functional. With that said, the room is large and has comfy beds. Seemed clean. The room is so dark though, I don't get that. They need an overhead light. Even with all the lights on the room was still too dark. The building is old and you can tell by the brick walls in the room and paint job but not a bad place for a dead cheap price. The bathroom is very small. The door practically hits the toilet. Yes Vegas is noisy. It is a 24 hour city and I have stayed at luxorious hotels where I have been kept awake by party goers too. You can't escape it in Vegas if you are there for a non party reason. So I don't fault the hotel for that. Like the caption says why are you in Vegas? if it is to party and gamble stay downtown. Ny Ny has great packages and the Tropicana is usually pretty cheap too. If you are here for a convention stay at the Marriiot Suites, which is a gorgeous hotel.If you are here just for a bed and want to feel safer then the Econolodge on the north strip which is dangerous, no casino, and the same price, stay at The Fiesta!( but you need a car) I thought it was well worth the cheap price. Yes they do charge a service fee and charge for wifi but so does every other hotel in Vegas. If they say they do not they are adding it to your room rate. The Fiesta is ony 5 something a night where the other places charge much more plus they charge for the light bill too and the Fiesta does not charge for utility surcharge. ( Or if they do it is in the room price) tip- when driving here do not park in garage but take the second entrance on Rancho and park by sports book closer to the hotel check in desk. Wish I knew that first!Tip - I liked that the hotel has a secure entrance for the guests. you have to use a key to get to the hotel elevators. Nice!tip- the hotel has many eating place choices- great!tip- the hotel has looser slots then on the strip plus a good gaming card( if you gamble lots of locals here. That is always a good sign if you are a serious gambler) tip- book on Expedia cheaper then the hotels websight. Please do not pay more than 130 bucks a night for a room here. The listed price in the room is the rack rate whch claims 495 a night. There is no way this hotel is worth anything close to that. Ceaser's Palace charges less than that. I know hotels rarely charge the rack rate but in case they do for your stay, do not book it. This room is worth about 80-120 bucks a night, even in high season.Advice- being an ex hotel worker/manager I did have 2 qualms about the hotel for better service. One is, the first morning I woke up and noticed a lot of noise coming from the end of the hall by the elevator I was approaching to use.I was up very early ( 6am) and the maids were very loud. I was very surprised by that. I did not think that was very approropriate since I was probably the only person up at that hour. They were laughing and telling stories, which is ok, but way to noisy for a corrider in a place people pay money to sleep at. They were very nice and always greeted me kindly which is a plus, but if I was their boss I would have asked they to limit the noise. The second thing was when I walked by the maids to the elevators, workers were painting the elevator. This should be told to guests ahead of time in case any guests have medical conditions associated with paint fumes. I could not smell the paint outside of the small corrider the elevator was in but dont know if that is true for everyone else, especially the end rooms next to the painting. I did not even notice a sign that said they were renovating. That is not a good thing in my opinion as an ex hospitality worker.  So if you want a bed in a safe ok place stay here. If you want fancy, and are planing on a strip stay don't stay here. I was happy overall with the price and what I received in return for this trip. VIVA LAS VEGAS!A world on to itself!"
11,342,"Jan 28 2008 	Not as bad as the reviews I had read	I needed to be in Las Vegas for my neice's soccer tournament Jan 25 - 27 - which was in the Northwest area of town, so I went on HOTWIRE and saw a $49 listing and took it. It turned out to be Rancho Fiesta.I came to Trip Advisor and read the reviews and almost wanted to cry.I got in to the Casino/Hotel about 2 pm. The check-in lady was very nice. I verified that I was going to get a non-smoking room and was told &quot;Yes&quot;.I got to my room on the 2nd floor and was SURPRISED at how nice and clean it actually was and for the most part smoke free.The room looked like a typical 2* hotel, but was VERY CLEAN. Some people had complained about noice - but I didn't hear much beyond the neighboring shower running.Since I wasn't there to gamble - I only made a quick run through the casino part and saw that there were many opportunities for food including a buffet. I opted for the Subway which is located just next to the Ice Skating rink.There is also a brand new Super Walmart located right behind the hotel if you need to pick anything up.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Would I have liked to have gotten the La Quinta instead - Of course I would have - but this was nice enough for the $49 a night rate on a weekend stay."
12,342,"Nov 20 2007	Had a great time in the casino ...	The dealers and the Slot Club people were wonderful. We loved our Roulette dealer. She seemed to be thrilled when we hit a number. We ended up winning $30 after playing for a long time. Drink service was quick. Loose slots, too."
13,342,"Jan 25 2007 	Don't go here	Landed up coming into L.V. late on a Sat afternoon w/o a reservation. We knew better, but had no choice. The place is a dump. The staff at the desk was rude. In addition to a terrible room they add on for having a telephone in the room. What a rip. No wi-fi. The casino had a rather very low life clientele.Texas Station restaurant is the only saving grace across the parking lot.Rooms are small and 60's decor and not by design."
14,342,"Aug 4 2005	Terrible Stay at the Fiesta	We stayed at the Fiesta for 3 nights recently. The pictures of their rooms shown on their website are totally misrepresentative of what the rooms really look like. Those pictures must have been taken at a classier hotel, definitely not at the Fiesta. The entire hotel is dingy and smelly. Rooms are small, dark and have a horrendous color scheme. Beds are uncomfortable. There was mold on the shower curtain. Staff was incredibly rude except for one security guard and a couple of the ladies on the housekeeping staff who were very friendly. Saturday and Sunday night rates are way overpriced for what you get. Also, Sunday night seems to be &quot;riff-raff&quot; night at the casino. Not a pleasant experience and will never stay there again."
15,342,Jul 27 2005	Hated it!!	Last week we spent one night at the Fiesta Rancho Casino and Hotel. Boy were the Attendants at the check-in desk rude! The rooms were small even with two full size beds! The mattresses are covered with plastic wrap so that every time you turn in bed you wake up because the noise it makes is just too loud. Navigating the hallways and the casino itself was very confusing because the walls of the casino are mirrored to give the illusion that the casino is much bigger than it really is and you have to go through a security door to get to the main room tower. All in all not a very relaxing night which is what I thought it would turn out to be away from the strip.
16,342,"Jun 22 2005	For polite service go elsewhere	My family and I stayed at this local hotel because we have family nearby. We were surprised by rude and inattentive staff who acted as if they could care less whether we were there or not. The hall and elevator carpets are worn and stained and badly in need of a vacuuming. The elevator doors were old and heavy and shut hard on my husband's back when he entered w/his suitcare. The room was unimpressive and small. We called a posted number to complain about two staff members who were particularly rude and abrupt when we asked questions and were told we would be contacted by management but this never happened. You will likely get much better SERVICE elsewhere in Vegas. For a town committed to tourism and service this place was a nightmare. Spend a little more and stay on the strip where your business is valued and appreciated. Avoid this place! DH - Wichita, KS"
17,342,"Mar 18 2005	large casino good pit boss comps	came to play in a Ice Hockey tourneyment. The place is nice and spacious. The Craps Pit Boss (Bill) was great, and as soon as I tipped the waitress a Red Chip ($5) she came every 5 minutes!The dealers were slow, but ok. The buffet comp is easy to score, and has avg food. The 10x odds on craps was nice.If you are looking to stay somewhere away from all the action, this is a good value. Large Texas station casino next door has more resturants.Just ask pit boss for some food there...."
18,342,"Jan 19 2005	It's okay if you don't mind not staying on the Strip	The Fiesta seems to have some cool things about it like an ice skating rink, karaoke performances, and what looks to be a good Mexican restaurant along with a buffet. Plus, it's next to the Texas Station, which has a movie theater, arcade, and even more restaurants. Our room was comfortable, but the selection of TV channels was quite limited. Also, the outdoor pool is small and quite undeveloped, and it seems like hotel guests don't get any special perks for staying at the Fiesta. That was disappointing. Perhaps most troubling of all though is the distance between the Fiesta and the Las Vegas Strip; it's like 10 miles or so. Besides this establishment and the Texas Station, there isn't too much to do in the immediate area. If you want to be close to the action of the Strip, then I don't recommend this place; otherwise, it is an okay deal for the price, I think."
1,347,Nov 22 2009 	Thank You For A Pleasant Stay!!!	My husband and I along with another couple stayed at the Fremont the first week of November. We had a very enjoyable time. The rooms are small but who goes to Vegas to stay in the room. The housekeeping staff do a fantastic job our room was cleaned and restocked everyday. Also our room was very quiet and comfortable. The casino and hotel staff were always very friendly and helpful. Would stay here again on future trips. Center of all the action at Fremont Street. The buffet was very good and had a great choice of menu items. Be sure to get your players card and take advantage of comps and discounts.
2,347,"Nov 5 2009 	Beware of Scam!!!!!!	Do not use the bank machines at the Freemont Hotel. The bank machines themselves are not what you need to worry about, it is the crooked casino cashier's. Whe you use the bank machines they provide you with a voucher you need to bring to the cashier. The cashier will find some reason that they cannot give you the cash. They will claim that if they do not process the voucher the funds will be returned to your account , this is NOT true. Instead of taking their word for it I contacted my bank who informed me that the money was out of my account and the transaction was closed. I agrgued with the unsavoury staff for about 15 minutes when they threatened to call security....I welcomed this and suggested they call the police as well so I could file a complaint. Some moments later their greasy supervisor arrived and I had to argue with him for 30 minutes. When they realized I was not taking no for an answer and would not leave until I received my money, they caved and handed me my cash. This put a bad spin on an otherwise great trip."
3,347,"Oct 22 2009 	We Were Disgusted!	We have stayed at the Fremont a few times in the past. We were perfectly happy there until the last day of our last trip. We were in Room 602 and were getting ready for our 11:OO AM check-out when we saw a cockroach sitting on the bathroom sink. As anyone reading this knows,there is no such thing as just one cockroach! Needless to say,we will never stay there again."
4,347,"Oct 11 2009 	Awful!	I cannot believe this was rated 3 stars by Expedia. The only reason we stayed there was because it was rated 3 stars and the Golden Nugget was booked.I will never trust Expedia again when it comes to hotel ratings. Rooms were extremely small. They claim it was a non smoking room and we could smell the smoke. They claim it had recently been renovated and the ceiling had large water spots. There was hair on one of the towels. We paid $100.00 and would have gladly lost the money and gone home, but it was late at night when we got there. Downtown Vegas is a seedy side of town and I will never go there again. If you do not like smoke, stay away. None of the hotels in the area looked any better except maybe the Golden Nugget. We left at 5:00 A.M. in the morning to get out of there."
5,347,"Sep 30 2009 	Nice remodeled rooms but with old lumpy beds	We visit Las Vegas 4 to 5 times a year. We usually stay at the Golden Nugget in downtown Vegas, but had a one night between hotels, so we tried the Fremont. Just glad it was for one night. The rooms are very small and the ceilings are low in the bathroom, which makes you feel a little claustrophobic. Although the remodel has a nice contemporary feel and look, the beds were most uncomfortable and lumpy. Sorry, if there is a remodeled room why not do the mattresses too?! We'll stick to the GN as our first choice in the downtown area, and Main Street as our second choice. AND another biggie...no free internet!"
6,347,"Sep 28 2009 	don't stay at the fremont	I have been going to Vegas for fourteen years and I have never been treated so badly when it came to getting my comps at the end of the week. We ran about twenty thousand dollars through the machines during our five day stay, and they refused to comp. a $97.00 dollar food bill. I went from the player's club, to a host, to a customer service specialist and got nothing but a runaround. They actually felt they gave me a deal because they comped our five night stay. They should have, because that was the smallest room I have ever been in. Our cash back total at the end of the week was $23.00 for the two of us. What a joke. We earned more than that in comps when we went over to Binion's and played for four hours."
7,347,"Sep 23 2009 	Convenient location good value	We chose this hotel because we wanted to be near the Fremont Street Experience. Our room was very small but clean and updated with modern decor. This is an old hotel and the plumbing showed it. The toilet was an issue. The bathroom was very small and would not fit a standard toilet with tank. The toilet was similar to what you see in a public restroom. The flush handle was located behind the lid therefore the lid had to be closed first in order to get to the handle and had to be flushed several times after each use. The bathroom seemed to be put together in haste. The sink was tilted back and the sink stopper stayed closed, we had to pull it out completely to allow the sink to drain. The air conditioner in the room could not be controlled and was cold at times. It was also quite loud but this turned out to be a blessing as our room was located directly above the Fremont Street Experience which was quite loud. The air conditioner served as &quot;white noise&quot; to block out the sounds of the street below. I was surprised to find the room had plantation shutters instead of black out drapes but the shutters worked well enough blocking out the light. These are not five star accommodations but we were quite pleased with the price and the modern decor. I was really impressed at how friendly and happy all of the staff at the Fremont were. We ate dinner at Tony Roma's which was quite good. The buffet is typical of the buffets of old Las Vegas, not very good. We had breakfast there. Not a lot of choices but you can have an omelet made to order and your coffee cup is kept full and again the staff were all friendly. We went in all of the casinos downtown and in our opinion the Fremont gave the friendliest customer service and was the only casino that we could find a cocktail waitress taking orders for comp drinks."
8,347,Sep 19 2009 	GREAT PLACE	This was my first stay at the fremont and loved it.The rooms are small and very clean.But i dont go to a casino to stay in my room.The casino was excellent and done very good on the slots.The staff was great and every one i delt with was just as friendly as could be.Ive been staying on the strip for 11 years and needed a change.Im glad i picked the fremont and will go back..The fremont gets a&quot; EXCELLENT &quot; from me.
9,347,"Sep 17 2009	Fremont Hotel/Casino LasVegas	Stayed at fremont hotel Sept 7-11. Room was clean, housekeeping good. Friendly employees. Will stay there again on my next trip."
10,347,"Sep 12 2009 	Decent enough basic accomodations	I've stayed at the Fremont many times and know what to expect by now. Rooms are basic, clean but nothing fancy. The TV gets very few channels - the locals, CNN, ESPN, TBS, Weather Channel and that's about it I think. There's an in-room safe (with a key, not a combination) which is always good to have in LV. I've noticed that there are no longer any comforters on the beds, just a very light blanket. I find it hard to sleep without something heavier covering me. It's also just about the only hotel-casino in Las Vegas without a self-parking lot - it's valet only which I don't really care for, although service from the valet was good enough. The hotel doesn't provide any kind of high speed internet access. I was able to connect to some kind of general-use wireless access provided by a well-known travel site, but it didn't work that well, very frequent service interruptions.Buffet is average but cheap. Tony Roma's is good (although I didn't get to go this trip). Casino has some decent games but I always seem to have bad luck gambling there."
11,347,"Aug 25 2009 	Sam Boyd's Fremont Hotel and Casino	The property itself is old but extremely clean and safe. The casino restroom is brightly lit and very clean. The guest room is somewhat spartan but who stays in the room aside from sleeping or a quick rest in Vegas? It seems like Fremont's housekeeping department has very high standards--the guest room we occupied was extremely clean! Also, the towels and toiletries were provided generously. And no strands of hair or debris of any sort! You always felt safe on the casino floor especially if you are accompanying an elderly spouse because the hotel security is quite good. You can always spot a security officer, but they are never in your face. The hotel staff are all courteous and very helpful--they are not pushy and will always assist you when you ask for help. The properties on downtown Vegas are old, but the Fremont Hotel and Casino is very clean and safe place. Not too fancy like the strip but very dandy and fun. The hotel restaurant features a decent buffet so you really don't have to leave the property for anything! And the pricing at both the restaurant and cafeteria--not bad at all! The biggest asset of this hotel is safety! Never a bad experience!"
12,347,"Aug 7 2009 	Downtown appeal that's it.	I liked the low limits, the closeness of it all compared to the strip and most of the folks were nice and friendly. The room was clean, as was the rest of the place. A little more smokey than the big strip places but I liked the old Vegas charm of it. I gambled at the El Cortez down the street and loved it. That place is the one for downtown. My wife liked the closeness to everything on Fremont St so that's why this hotel, but next time I will either stay at Golden Nugget or El Cortez. E.C. had buck roulette spinning on three tables. Love that place.The Plaze had a ten buck a night deal so we checked that place out and it seemed comparable to our place. Pretty clean and willing to have you business. We also loved the quaint old school charm of the Golden Gate casino. Mermaids casino was all about jamming drinks down your throat from the moment you walk by, so you plunk a few quarters in there slots. Downtown was jamming for about three-four hours in the evening but other than that, it felt like a ghost town. I hope they can pump that area up a bit, it needs it."
13,347,"Jul 25 2009 	free upgrade to suite! but don't like valet service	we booked a standard room and checked in after midnight. the front desk lady was friendly and whispered to us that they do not have any more standard room and will ugprade us for free to suite! at the top floor of the hotel. ok the suite is smaller than most big hotel but it is still great. 1 king bed, full sofa set. 2 LCD tv in room. walk in wardrobe and clean toilet. i would think the normal rooms are ok too. service is good. friendly staff. bad thing is the valet. very troublesome to get the car for a short trip out.sadly there is no free internet"
14,347,"Jul 2 2009 	First stay downtown....loved it!	Just returned from Las Vegas staying at the Fremont Hotel downtown and we are glad we did! Great location and friendly people! Great Food.... We have always stayed on the strip.....but, we were ready for a change! Did NOT even go to the STRIP! We were entertained by gambling in the friendly casinos and restaurants which were wonderful! Great VALUE........ we just wanted to hang out for 4 days and enjoy!"
15,347,"Jun 24 2009 	Nice but...	We stayed at the Fremont from June 16th to June 18th. The staff was very nice, the hotel appeared clean...however... We stayed in room 621, which faces Binion's across the street. There was some slight noise at night from the Street Experience shows, but nothing too jarring. The air conditioner worked fine, the bathroom was small but clean and usable. The room was overall clean, and the housekeeping was very good during our stay.The only surprise was that on our last morning there, I awoke to find the largest cockroach I have ever seen in my 40 years of living, sitting quite contently on the wall next to the nightstand. It did not move, it just sat there. Because the shutters were closed, it was still a bit dark in the room, and at first, I thought it couldn't be a roach, because I'd never seen one that big. But I recognized the shape, and I knew it had to be a roach. So I got out of bed, opend the shutters, and confirmed my suspicion. I did a quick measurement by comparison, and found that this cockroach was 2 1/2 inches long, and 1 1/4 inches wide. It was really, really big. Finally, my partner killed it with a shoe. I'm just glad that it was our last day there, because I don't think I could've slept one more night in that room.Again, the hotel is relatively clean, it's just that the cockroach thing really put me off wanting to stay there again. I like the Fremont for gaming, but I don't think I'd stay there again."
16,347,"Jun 15 2009 	Not bad	We stayed there last year for a few days on the weekend before moving to the strip during the week because it was way cheaper, about $50 a night. It was worth every penny.The rooms were updated and just as good as the room we had at New York New York.The odds at the tables were better than the strip and the dealers were very friendly and explained the rules to newcomers well.Check-in was quick and painless.Highly recommended if you don't mind missing the glitz of the strip for a whole lot less money for a room. Save a hundred a night on the room and spend it on the strip, it's only a 15 minutes bus ride away."
17,347,May 24 2009 	Nothing Fancy	This was my 5th trip to Vegas and first time staying down on Fremont Street. I would stay at the Golden Nugget next time.
18,347,"May 4 2009 	Great value	My husband, 2 sisters in law, and brother in law stayed for four nights and thought the accomodations were outstanding. We accepted an offer of 3 free nights and $150.00 in food having never stayed at the Fremont. Our rooms were obviously just renovated and the updating was very tastefully done. The breakfast buffet was especially good and the omelet fixed fresh by a cook was a treat. Some food at the evening buffet was overdone but on a whole was good. The Thursday night buffet at Main Strret Station was as good as usual. We rarely eat more than one buffet on a trip to LV but the food offer was too good to resist. We travel to LV yearly from Indiana and will stay at the Fremont when we come next year. We have stayed at the Nugget, Binion's, and Fitzgerald's downtown and many places on the Strip over a 20 year period. We love to gamble downtown and appreciate that the hotel and food available at hotels are equal to those on the Strip. Thanks for the offer, Bconnected team!"
19,347,Apr 28 2009 	Nice and clean!	My husband and I stayed at the Fremont Hotel for two nights. I liked the contemporary design of the room. It was clean and comfortable. The Paradise Buffet inside the hotel is not expensive (7.99 for lunch) but it's not great. No high-speed internet.
20,347,"Apr 23 2009 	good stay at the Fremont	I had a good experience at the Fremont. My room was very clean, all in working order, and made up promptly each day. Employees were friendly and helpful. My only complaint is a general one which many Vegas casinos have......the casino itself is quite smokey (I'm asthmatic). I long for the day when it is banned everywhere public. I think businesses need to know that just as many people, if not more, will come because there is NO SMOKE than the amount who will leave if they can't."
21,347,"Apr 23 2009 	Perfectly nice	If you're looking for the Vegas experience with an opulent themed hotel, you should definitely avoid the Fremont. If, on the other hand, you want a perfectly nice, simple place to stay and you don't need all the bells and whistles of Vegas, this is a great place to stay. Location? No, it's not The Strip, but that's a good thing. Fremont Street is exciting in its own right, less chaotic, and certainly less crowded. Ambiance? Fine. Again, it's much more akin to what you would find in a nice hotel in another city, rather than Vegas, and that's a good thing. Rooms? Small, but the beds are comfortable and the colors are soothing.Where the hotel could improve is on housekeeping. My room, which was ostensibly non-smoking and had a shiny plaque on the door which promised such, reeked of smoke. In addition, the sheets on the bed on the first night actually had several huge rips and holes. Housekeeping picked up the slack the next day and the room was kept impeccably after that, but I'm still wondering how anyone could possibly have thought it would be acceptable to make up a bed with ripped sheets. Aside from that, the stay was fine and I wouldn't hesitate to return."
22,347,"Apr 16 2009 	Downtown is getting like up town in service	I love going to Veags and staying in the &quot;cheap&quot; places 'cause I like going out of the room /hotel as much as possible, but the Fremont thinks thay belong to the MGM properties. Room was great, but parking is a valet that works on tips. A few years ago, you could park across the street in the parking garage, but even that's limited now. To confirm the rom as well, had to sign up for their casino points card. How often do you gamble in the same place-in Vegas? in short, good deal but watchout for 'freebies&quot; and the food. Besides the Paradise buffet they have, anyting else there is crap!"
23,347,"Apr 1 2009 	Great Value for the money. Signing up for players card pays off.	My friend and I went to the Fremont last November. Let me first say that we don't go to Vegas to see shows and walk around. We go to Vegas to gamble for hours on end and drink alot of beer. While the cleanliness leaves something to be desired, the staff is extremely friendly and always helpful. We both play blackjack and find that the blackjack pays outs are better than the strip (3:2 vs 6:5) and table limits are usually $5...sometimes $3! The drink service is very good and a dollar tip now and then will ensure that you will never be thirsty. I had one instance where a server removed a quarter full beer from my hand just to give me a cold one. The dealers are hit or miss in the friendliness department, but for the most part they are fine. Finally, signup for the BConnected players card. We were there for 3 days and did a fair amount of gambling (8-9 hours per day), at the end of our stay, both rooms were comped! And we were only betting the $5 minimum most of the time. My friend and I are going back in a few weeks and we have books separate rooms and once again, both comped. We are by no means high rollers but it shows they appreciate the little bit we do bring. If you want an affordable, friendly stay that is away from the Strip...Fremont is it."
24,347,"Feb 15 2009 	Unfair Practice	Room was very stink from smoking. Staff at the Paradise Cafe were very unfriendly and seem that they did not care about guest, food was terrible. More than 7 slots machines were locked down due to guest having them locked. It was hard trying to find a cocktail waitress to order drinks. Floor attendants were not friendly at all."
25,347,"Feb 14 2009 	Great hotel staff friendly and helpful	Stayed at the Fremont for 6 nights this January, found previous reviews very helpful, had a realy good stay. Would rcomend this hotel to anyone planning a visit. Staff were very helpful and did all they could to answer any queries we had. Checking and out process took about 1 min and free valet parking is brilliant, we didnt eat at this hotel but it was alway busy, The bathroom is very small as stated by other visitors but it is adequate for what you need it for and the beds are so comfy its hard to get up in the morning. Binions breakfast was great and set us up for the day. A trip to the Hoover Dam is recomended, and try and visit the sister hotel of the Fremont (Sams Town) we had a great night there and the transport is free from the hotel. Next visit to Vegas will be to Fremont street as we find you are hassled by people handing flyers and cards out for strip clubs and lap dancers when you go up the strip very annoying and offensve. Most excellant holiday was had by all would recomend this hotel to anyone."
26,347,Feb 4 2009 	New Years	Stayed at the freemont hotel it was a basic room the beds were comfortable the party outside on the street was fantastic we ate at binions downstairs restaraunt 3.99 breakfast and 3.99 buger and fries and pot. I found the free booze not watered down like on the strip. you actually got drunk . Going again this year staying at the same place.
27,347,"Jan 22 2009	Great Hotel	The staff was very helpful and pleasant. I booked a room with two double beds and even though we arrived at the hotel earlier than planned, were able to check right in. There was not a wait to check in or out. Hotel room itself was very nice. The bathroom is on the small side, but they do have the curved shower rod so you dont feel cramped in the shower. The beds were comfortable and room was very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We stayed three nights and I did request a room change after the first night, due to room right next to the Fremont Street Experience was loud. But even that ends at midnight, so if you stay up late, you will not have an issue with that. The front desk was very helpful about changing rooms and the next two nights were even better. They provide a room safe at no charge, which is great if you do not and to take all you money out with you. I have stayed at hotels on the strip that were not a pleasant as this one."
28,347,"Jan 20 2009 	Loved the Downtown Atmosphere	Date: January 20, 2009Reviewer: A Trip Advisor Member, Shreveport, LaMy mom and I stayed 3 free nights at the Fremont Hotel Las Vegas. The rooms are small but clean and the beds are comfortable as others have said. The bathroom is even smaller but was able to accomodate the 2 of us. The buffet was okay but not many food choices, Tony Romas was good though. The front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The first room they gave us had a terrible view. We called back downstairs and they immediately gave us a room with a view of the main street. Overall we were satisfied with our stay and would definately stay there again. There was no wait checking in or checking out."
29,347,"Jan 12 2009	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Ok, if you come to Vegas you want to stay on the strip unless these things apply to you.You like being around old people.You are Ugly. Or like ugly peopleYou are Weird, (like clinically nuts) or like themYou want a sub par time. You dont like fun.If Lights flashing over your head is The Best it can get for you.If you like old or ugly wait staff, and employees serving you. (To be fair some are not old or ugly but few and far between)You like to wait a long time to get a drink.You like Small Rooms.You like old casino machines.You like tacky decoration.You dont care about ambiance.Basically, Vegas is located on the strip, not downtown, The Casinos there suck compared to the strip. The entertainment sucks compared to the strip. The people who go here are not attractive or exciting or fun or happy, unless they are stumbling drunk. You do indeed pay for what you get... Pay more and stay at a well known casino hotel on the strip, MGM, New York New York, Belagio, Planet Hollywood, Wynn, Encore, Paris, Excalibur, Luxor, Mandelay Bay, or whatever, Just stay on the Strip, you will enjoy your time and the people around you much more. You don't have to be a model or anything but I guarantee you will not be seeing any of these in the downtown area. I have learned my lesson and will never go back there again. Yuck. Im not stuck up, Im not vain. I am a normal guy who likes to have a good time, and feel like I am being treated when I go on vacation. I wish I could stay at Encore (a little too expensive, maybe some day) till then MGM, Mandalay, or the others I listed) Go downtown if you were offended from my comments in the first part of this message. Sounds cross, sounds even mean. However its true."
30,347,"Jan 7 2009	Its cheap and ugly!!	Okay so we stayed at the Venetian for a few days and downgraded to the Fremont which is away from the Vegas strip. There is nothing nearby but a few rubbishy souvenir shops. The hotel is a non event. You must valet park, then you go into a small lobby and off u go to the most basic room a hotel could offer. It was grubby with no view.I did have a peep at the golden nugget across the road, if u must stay in this area, go there. It is roughly the same price but far more up-to-date, has a pool, better atmosphere and there is a far nicer atmosphere.However, do try Tony Roma's ribs in the Fremont, it is the only eason I'm giving the place 2 stars."
31,347,"Dec 30 2008 	Checked in; Checked Out - Immediately	Decided on Fremont because of its location and because I'd heard it was recently renovated. Specifically indicated room was for ONE person and reserved room with 2 full beds. Arrived at 11:30 p.m. Was directed to room with one kingsized bed. Very small room with only available electrical outlet at a location where I could not use CPAP machine. They don't show the bathrooms on the virtual tour for a reason: they are about the size of a gutted walk-in closet - or smaller. Very miniscule shelf space in bath; if I'd left cell phone on shelf to charge (only other electrical outlet), it would have vibrated into toilet. Asked for different room, was told &quot;company policy&quot; is only one bed for one person; not true since I've stayed at other Boyd properties in 2-bedded room. Front desk was not at all helpful. Insisted and was directed to an identical room (and bath) on another floor. At that point, I called Main Street Station (owned by same company) and arranged to stay there; checked out and moved. Main Street comped me for the night that was by then almost over and gave me spaceous room with sufficient electrical access and bathroom facilities. Main Street is cleanest hotel I've ever used."
32,347,"Dec 28 2008	Good Value for Vegas	They have really cleaned up the downtown area in recent years. We have never stayed downtown before, but were very impressed with the value. The fremont does not offer self-parking but does have a valet service that was always friendly and fast. The rooms were recently renovated with good taste, and everything was clean and well-kept. The downside to our room was that we had a view of the air conditioner unit, but we couldn't really complain since we only paid $30 CAD a night (which included friday night!). We didn't have the chance to eat at the fremont as they close their buffet for several weeks in december (dec 12ish - jan). The casino is a little bit smokier than others, but was chock full of people at all hours (mostly hawaiians). The front desk staff were very friendly. I would recommend renting a car and staying here, its a better value than strip hotels. Also, try the main street station buffett, its really fantastic (especially for the price!! $7.77 for lunch!)."
33,347,Dec 14 2008 	Another Great Stay at the Fremont	Another good stay at the Fremont. This is the first time that we have had a rental car and found the valet to be quick and efficient. As usual check in was a breeze and my request for a refrigerator in the room was delivered upon in a matter of minutes.As I have always said the rooms are small but nice and the staff all over the property is more than friendly. Enjoyed a great meal in Tony Roma's. Love the atmosphere and had a great time. I recommend the Fremont to anyone looking for a good place to stay downtown.
34,347,"Oct 23 2008 	Great for the money just don;t expect too much	We stayed here in April 3 of us in a room which worked out to around 10 a head or less. For that you can't complain. It was clean with a good location, as a place to rest your head it was more than adequate. The room was dated but clean, comfy and spacious, just don't expect it to be glizty because it isn't, it does what it need to do. If you fancy a cheap base and would rather spend you money on going out then this place is great. I'd say it was a better room than the Plaza but that could just be luck of the draw. It lacks atmosphere in the casino so for a first timer I'd not go there, you want your Wow factor so the Nugget or a strip hotel would be better, and there is no pool. For a cheap base It is fab but I wouldn't want to be paying over $45 dollars per room for two as there are always deals to be had somewhere. We stayed here for 3 days while the Golden Nugget was expensive ($120 a night) then when their prices went down mid week we moved to the Nugget. It worked well, i'd consider doing a similar split between here and a fancy strip hotel."
35,347,Oct 22 2008 	Great location	Great location right on Fremont Street---famous light show right outside hotel---friendly efficient checkin---nice room---good buffet---helpful valet parking---great value---no problems
36,347,"Oct 7 2008	Loved the Fremont	Fremont is close to the bus terminal going to the Strip,pretty much accessible to everything...When we get there, check in is quick, I didn't know that our room is a smoking room, we stayed there for 1 night. then I asked the front desk to change my room the next day which they did.... Everybody is so friendly and the room is super clean. I would recommend this hotel to All... Very good buffet restaurant, there's Tony Roma, Dunkin Donut, We got a $5 ticket for 24 hours to go around the strip, which is really cool... Fremont will always be my choice of hotel, and we will most definitely go back...."
37,347,"Oct 5 2008 	I totally reccomend this hotel!!!	The Fremont Hotel is a awesome place to stay. My Friend and I meet at least twice a year from Hawaii and San Diego for our Birthdays. We have the best time, and we usually don't venture too far from the hotel. The rooms are always clean and the staff in the casino are very nice. I like eating at Tony Ramos--one of my favorite Restaurants. The Fremont Hotel will always be my choice of places to stay. I like it so much I'm coming back November/2008 with my girlfriend ofcourse!!!"
38,347,"Oct 3 2008 	A pleasant surprise	I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The rooms are really cute. I like the decor in it's attempt to be modern and young. The check-in process is quick and easy. The staff is polite and professional.They only have valet parking in the hotel, but it's free. They just ask that you tip the valets. I did not try any of the restaurants, but I did try the Dunkin Donuts - a handy place to have if you don't have time for a sit down meal. They offer $.99 margaritas and $2.00 Heineken at the bars.I can't speak to the gambling as I didn't do any. We're just there for a place to sleep and it fit the bill for the most part. My only complaint is that it can get really loud. My friend and I went back to our room around 8pm on Saturday night to try and catch a nap before heading out for the evening. It was almost impossible though because of the blaring music coming from Fremont Street. I'd fall alseep and then wakeup when they started a new song. I think the people on the street had to be going deaf because it was insanely loud. Perhaps if we'd gotten a room on a different side of the building it'd have been quieter? Otherwise, the rooms were clean and a decent size. The TV in the room was quite small - I believe it was 19&quot;. One of the smallest I've seen in a hotel room. It's not a hotel for younger guests (my friend and I are in our mid 20s and early 30s). The average age of the guests there I'd guess was around 50. In any case, Fremont was a great deal for the price and I'd probably go back provided I could get a quieter room."
39,347,"Sep 11 2008 	Great Location and Staff	We (me and wife) stayed at the Fremont for the weekend of Aug 8-10 before moving to the Stratosphere (see my other review) for Aug 10-15. We were visiting Vegas for our 21st anniversary. The price at the Fremont was half the Stratosphere for the weekend at $54 per night (Fri and Sat night). The room was super clean - a little on the small side - but did have a full King Size bed and full bath - not much else fits in the room. But you know what - it was great for the few hours we actually spent in the room.The staff at this hotel / casino are great from the Valet to front desk to cocktail waitresses and dealers - all super customer service. The check in at the hotel from car drop off at valet to our room took a whole 5 minutes and our check out was even quicker!! The drink service in the casino was better then any other casino we vistted this week (and we went to a lot!)We had champagne brunch both Saturday and Sunday in the buffet - very nice buffet - one of the better ones we ate at. With 2 for 1 from hotel checkin the first day and comped 2 for 1 the second day we had champagne brunch with tip for less then $20 for the two of us.Great $3 blackjack and video poker selection. Nice enough casino with a Dunkin Donuts in the middle for morning coffee.But the best part of this hotel is its location - from our room to the middle of Fremont Street with access to Four Queens, Golden Nugget etc. took less than 3 minutes. Down the hall, down the elevator, short walk through casino and you are outside.Anyways I think you get the idea - this place is great - we wanted to stay downtown for the weekend and experience Fremont Street without having to drive back to the strip at night - and we got a great treat. We may even stay here for the whole week on our next visit."
40,347,"Jul 9 2008 	Great cheap stay	OK, I was looking for a cheap hotel to stay in advance of my travelling companion turning up to share on the hotel costs. I was also conscious that I needed this cheap stay over the weekend when Vegas is at its most expensive. The idea of staying downtown then was a brainwave to cover the weekend and then I moved to the Strip for fantastic midweek rates by which time my friend had appeared.The Fremont was the perfect base for downtown. It was 30 / $60 for a Friday and a Sat in June and was just fantastic for the price. The place was clean and safe and right on Fremont St so you could nip down for the hourly light shows of an evening. The room was clean and tastefully if economically decorated. There was one Queen bed as there would not have been room for two beds and the room would have been fine for a couple - and was certainly roomy enough for one. The bathroom was small but roomy enough for two I would have thought - especially if one of you was in the shower! Btw, it was shower only, no bath. The room was spotless. Ice down the end of the hall. Safe in the room. I really couldn't fault the hotel. A brilliant bargain and I would recommend it whole-heartedly. Staff were very friendly."
41,347,"Jul 4 2008 	One quick night	I needed 1 night (a Friday) and booked with my Credit Card points so it was a free stay. Very easy to arrive, they only have free valet parking so that was a snap. Check in at 5pm was also a breeze.Room was very clean and bed was very comfortable. The safe had a missing key, called the desk and someone was there in 10 minutes. When he couldn't get the lock changed I went down and they gave me a new room. All staff that we interacted with were very nice. I do not have one complaint. Ate at the Buffet for brunch on Saturday with a 2 for 1 deal, the selection and quality were outstanding.Will stay again."
42,347,"Jun 20 2008 	Great as always	Stayed one night at the Fremont on Friday June 13. Since I was staying by myself, my room was small and had one double bed. Clean and comfortable. The one thing I noticed, I had to reserve a smoking room for booking late. Did not think to try and change it upon check in. The room itself did not smell like smoke but my pillows did. Was tired and didn't do anything about it.I really like how you don't have to walk far from the elevators to your room. I don't really like to gamble in the casino here, it's fairly small. I don't care for the food at the Fremont. The buffet is just ok and the food at the Lanai Express is awful (chinese food and shrimp cocktail). However, my sister likes the food at Lanai Express. Golden Gates has a great shrimp cocktail. Good prime rib at the 4 Queens and Binions. Also had a donut about 12:30 in the morning at Dunkin Donuts, it wasn't very fresh. I still love the rooms here and the rates are great. There are other casinos and food close by."
43,347,"Jun 14 2008 	Great Place to Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Fremont from June 1-6, 2008. Felt comfortable booking here because of the the reviews we read. The hotel was just as we expected, nothing fancy but comfortable and clean.Checked in around 2pm and the process took less than a minute. Very friendly check in, almost scary that this could take such short time. Felt like everyone knew us like neighbors.Our room did not have a safe (was removed for some reason) so they moved us to another room on the same floor immediately after maintenance came and looked at the room.Bathroom is small but clean and no problem for us. It might be a problem if there were four people trying to get ready for a dressier event at the same time but we just gambled the whole trip. Everything else in the room was just fine. True, there are not many TV channels but there was local news, ESPN, national news, and weather channel.The location is close to everything. Played a lot at Golden Gate because they had $3 blackjack and always openings at the $5 tables. The California was good because the had the Let It Ride table open in the morning. The 99 cent shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate is great and David Sommers playing the piano at the bar was super. The pickup and drop off for the duece (bus to the strip) was very close. We did not like the gambling at the Fremont because the Let it Ride did not open until about 8pm, we couldn't get on a blackjack table in the evening, and the blackjack table (dealing out of a shoe) was not open in the morning.We ate breakfast at the Fremont every morning and liked the buffet. Can not complain about the price. Two evening meals at the 4 queens was also very good. One evening meal at the California was not very good.Will definately stay here on our future trips. We go to Vegas about once a year or every 9 months. Have stayed on the strip before but found ourselves downtown the whole time."
44,347,May 28 2008	Best Cafe for eating downtown - period	Did not stay at this Casino - but it has the best Cafe for eating downtown. We stayed downtown 5 night and tried lots of places to eat and the Fremont Casino Cafe had the best food. We ate there 4 times.
45,347,"May 24 2008 	Great Downtown Property	I spent two nights at the Fremont Hotel in May. I decided to stop in Vegas on the way home to NY from LA and wanted to stay Downtown. I usually stay at the Golden Nugget, but I found the Fremont to be considerably cheaper for those two nights and decided to give it a try to experience something different. Really glad I made the choice! The Fremont Hotel was a very nice, comfortable, clean hotel right in the middle of Fremont Street. I would definitely consider the Fremont Hotel for future visits (as well as The GN).The check-in process cant be beat. Not one person in line when I arrived. I walked to the front desk (which was about 10 feet from the valet area), gave them my credit card and ID and had my keys in under a minute. Received the King Non-Smoking room I reserved without any problems. Elevators to the rooms were directly behind the front desk (about 5 steps). No long walks through the casino or past crowds. Everything was so easy. The room was very comfortable and clean. The rooms had a nice, modern dcor, not the old floral bedspreads and heavy curtains of some downtown properties. The bed and linens were especially comfortable. There was a single armchair and small side table, a dressing bench near the closet and a two drawer dresser which also included the TV. The closet included an iron and safe. Yes, the room was small but it was fine for me as a solo traveler and would be sufficient for a couple. The bathroom was very clean and well-laid out to maximize space. There were two counters that ran the length of the sink/toilet to provide for additional storage. The shower had good pressure. The curtain rod was bowed, providing a bit extra shoulder room in the shower. The towels were of nice quality and were very new (they even shed a bit due to lack of washes I believe). Soap, shampoo, conditioner and hair cap provided. There is also a hair dryer in the bathroom.As for room negatives, there were a few. I didnt like the look of the armchair in the room  its white so it showed a lot of stains. The TV was pretty small and the channel selection was very limited (I think there are 10 channels  two of which are hotel info stations). One of the window shutters didnt work properly so it limited light in the room. The room safe is key-locked, not code accessed, so one more thing to carry around and worry about losing. Thats about it though. Everything else more than met my expectations. The front desk staff, bars/buffet staff and housekeeping were all very friendly and helpful. Casino table personnel were less friendly, with special criticism of the craps dealers, who were particularly rude to several older customers. They yelled at one older woman repeatedly to toss her chips to the middle for hard-ways bets when it was very clear she had some mobility issues and struggled to toss the chips even a short distance. I guess I thought the dealers job was to assist the players! Much better crews (and odds) at Binions if youre a craps player.Ate at the buffet one morning and it was good value for the quality of the food provided but certainly not gourmet dining. The bar in the middle of the casino consistently had some of the best bartenders: friendly, engaging, quick to get a refill, etc. I also liked the addition of a Dunkin Donuts in the property for early morning pick-me-ups.Overall, I had a great stay at the Fremont. If youre looking for a comfortable, clean hotel in the middle of the Fremont Street action, I strongly recommend the Fremont Hotel. It will definitely be on my list the next time Im in LV."
46,347,"May 14 2008 	Comfortable hotel in Old Las Vegas	This was at least my 6th stay at the Fremont in the past ten or so years. I joined other family members there as we celebrated a landmark birthday for my Mother. I like staying downtown in &quot;Old&quot; Las Vegas--everything you need is right there and there are plenty of cheap shuttles or buses if you wish to go to the Strip or to the Mall or anywhere else. As other reviewers have said, the rooms at the Fremont are reasonably priced and adequate. I do not need a fancy hotel, but I like cleanliness and comfort. My bed and pillow were very comfortable and the sheets were crisp and clean; the lady from housekeeping, Katie, was very pleasant and accommodating and asked every day if we wanted our sheets changed. In my Mother's room there was a problem with the water not draining out of the tub, and we reported this; the plumber came right up and discovered the same problem in our neighbor's tub and snaked out the drain. . . I really did not want to know about all this. The bathrooms are small, reminding me of bathrooms in Italian hotels. The water in the shower is marvelously hot and the pressure, great. I loved the view in my room of the Sierra Nevadas and the nearby hotels. Unfortunately, the windows do not open, at all, so you can't get a breath of fresh air. There is an air conditioner/heating unit in the room which makes for some kind of air circulation; despite this, and despite the fact that we were on a no smoking floor, secondhand smoke drifted up through the elevator shaft, I guess, and sometimes came into my room under the door. I rolled up a towel and put it against the space under the door when I went to bed at night. There is also a considerable amount of cigarette smoke in the casino on the lower level which you have to walk through to get to your room. There was a small keyed safe in the room, an ironing board and iron, a hair dryer, plenty of towels, cups, ice bucket, and a TV. The usual pad of hotel paper was missing, there were just a few little pieces of white paper and a pen. Plenty of hangers. An upholstered chair and little table and also suitcase stands. The Fremont provided my Mother with some coupons for discounts in the hotel's restaurants; although they looked nice, the coupons weren't all that much of a bargain. We ate at the Paradise Buffet on a Friday night when it was seafood night, and it was a real disappointment. I guess, being a New Englander, I should know to avoid seafood out West, but this used to be a really nice buffet. I think the restaurant has been cutting corners to save money as the quality was not that high--iceberg lettuce on the salad bar and few interesting raw veggies for the salad; manufactured rolls and desserts; breaded shrimp that looked like Mrs. Paul's, etc. The restaurant space was gorgeous, but the hotel should be more careful because the quality is slipping. I liked the new Dunkin Donuts tucked away in a corner of the casino--nice for an inexpensive coffee and bagel. And we always love the 99 cent margaritas!I am not a wild gambler, but I play the slots a little. I have had one of the casino's &quot;Gold Cards&quot; that you put in the machine to tot up your credits. In all my visits through the years, I have never been able to use my credits for anything because the Fremont says you need to first reach 5,000 credits before you can cash them in for a meal, etc. Well, this is a ridiculous policy. I use my other little card at Binion's Horseshoe across the street and you can redeem your credits, no matter how few they are, towards a meal any time you wish; you don't even have to get a &quot;comp coupon&quot; ahead of time. In general, I would say that everything cost more in all the casinos and restaurants during this visit to Vegas; seems everyone has raised their prices to accommodate the current economy in the U.S. I guess. Even the slots were miserably tight, although I did see a few folks around me hitting four of a kind once in awhile. But no big ones!"
47,347,May 12 2008 	It is what it is	I booked the hotel based on the recommendations from other travelers in this site. I got what I expected. The review before mine indicated the hotel had no ice bucket or ice machine but at least on the 7th floor where I stayed there was one next to the stairs. Also Im 5'11'' and had plenty of room while sitting in the toilet. The rooms seemed to be newly remodeled and clean. Like old Vegas hotel/casinos the rooms at the Fremont were designed as a place to crash between gambling binges and not a room to hang out or conduct business. The TV had CNN (plus 9 other channels) and pay per view movies and I thought it was sufficient. This is the first time I stayed Downtown and I think Im coming back. If you want to visit other casinos within walking distance and cheap prices on booze and food the Fremont is the place.
48,347,"May 7 2008	A basic hotel with no extras	This is a basic hotel. If you want extras, you won't get it here. The room was clean, average size, but missing alot of amenities that you might not even think about until you need them. It did not have a desk, any internet service in the room, or ice bucket because the hotel has no ice available. The hotel has no fitness center and no business center. The bathroom was a little cramped. There's something about knocking your knees on the door while sitting on the toilet. The TV was small and only had very basic channels. I guess they want you down in the casino gambling, not up in your room watching TV. It is fine if you are just sleeping in it, which most people coming to Las Vegas are doing. But I'm here on business and it's a little difficult without a few of the business related amenities. I was also disappointed to see that there was not an extra security lock on the door. As a single person traveling, I appreciate the extra security lock, and notice when it's not there. The price was definitely good. It's in the old section of town, on Fremont Street, but there is easy access by bus to the newer section of town if you want to wander."
49,347,"May 4 2008 	Great downtown experience	I've stayed in several downtown Vegas hotels but this was the first time I booked a room at the Fremont. I was pleasantly surprised; yes the room is small and bathroom even smaller, but the room was clean and bed was comfortable. The hotel employees were friendly and our requests were taken care of promptly. Check in was the fastest I've ever experienced and I never had to wait for an elevator. I didn't care much for the food but they did have a good coffee spot. The only negative thing I can say about the Fremont is their lack of room darkening drapes. They have plantation shutters&gt;&gt;&gt;come on this is Vegas. After pulling an all nighter the last thing I wanted to see was the sun in my eyes. I like to stay up most of (or all) the night and sleep late when I visit Las Vegas. I wish the Fremont would change their window coverings. But that's just my own personal gripe. Overall I had a fantastic time at the Fremont."
50,347,"May 3 2008 	Explaining mixed Reviews	For those who pay for their own travel and want a clean, safe, reasonable hotel room than this is a good bet. My wife and I stayed in the Luxor for two nights, went to the Grand Canyon for some hiking and then needed a place to stay before an early morning flight. The first room we were given was right next to the Fremont experience light and sound show side of the hotel. The room was a suite, fairly large, had a fridge, and had not been remodeled in awhile. We asked for another room since I was concerned about the noise from the light and sound show (The front desk said that the light show was over at midnight so there should not be a problem still gave us a new room).The next room we were given was on the other side on the hotel was next to the banquet hall on the second floor. The was a banquet going on until 10:00pm but not really a problem. Second room had been redone within the last 2-4 years and was nicer than the first room - no fridge. If you are expecting the Luxor or updated hotel on the strip you will not get it. Paid $80 for the Luxor room during the week and was told the same room would be $200 for a Friday or Saturday night. Paid $80 for the Fremont room on a Saturday night. One reason for not giving it a &quot;5&quot; is that there are not many food options around the hotel."
51,347,"Apr 16 2008 	Humble but a great value	I'd simply say 'ditto' to the other reviews here, but that wouldn't help much. But since I won't be covering new ground, I'll try to keep it brief; read more reviews for more details.It started with a great rate when I booked my room from the hotel web site. A week later, the rate had dropped, and when I emailed, they matched the new rate. By the time I checked in, the rate was up again, but I still paid the lower price I had locked in.Check-in was friendly, painless and fast. The elevators were across from the front desk; no extra walks on narrow paths between slot machines. The room was small but adequate; so was the bathroom. It was all clean, and the bed was soft and comfortable. Adjustable wooden shutters filtered most of the morning light from the window. The old-fashioned air conditioner cooled the room just right when running at full blast. The TV channel selection was very basic, but had the local networks, the Weather Channel, TBS and ESPN. Free shampoo, conditioner and lotion. There was a wall safe too small for most laptops, an iron and ironing board, a hair drier, but no coffee maker.There were several very well-priced dining options and a 24-hour Dunkin Donuts. It was an easy walk to the entertainment of Fremont Street, or to catch the 108 city bus going to the Convention Center or the airport.You'd never call this place a luxury hotel, so I can't rate it 5 of 5. But it's adequate in every way and a great value. If you don't need a pool, the Fremont should work well for you."
52,347,"Apr 14 2008 	Good risk!	Stayed at the Fremont Hotel April 11-13. Was initially worried because our booking was done at the last minute and this was the most reasonably-priced hotel we could find (we wondered whether there was somehting wrong with it). Well, the hotel was certainly good for the price!We had a late check-in and didn't encounter any problems. We got the two beds we requested and going to the room was a breeze - the elevator was right across from the registration desk (no long walks!) and our room was two doors down from the elevator. The room was certainly nice. It was clean and updated, and had an Asian touch - from the window shutters and the decor, to the carpet that had a bambo design. The bathroom wasn't as small as I had feared and I liked the fact that the towel rack wasn't above the toilet as where most hotels disgustingly place theirs.We had good meals at The Paradise Buffet. Even for breakfast, the items were heavy and the selection was good. The price was $10.99, however, and not $6+, as we were there on a weekend. The hotel has a Dunkin Donuts branch, but If you want to purchase any food there, my advice woud be to get them ONLY in the morning when they're fresh.For those unfamiliar with the Fremont Street Experience or the hotel area, the hotel's official address is on Fremont St. but drivers can't use that road to locate the hotel. From south Las Vegas Blvd, go past Fremont St. and make a left on the next block (Ogden St.) and make another left after 3rd St. and look for the building's parking entrance on the left. The hotel has no self-parking option (valet-only but free), so be prepared for extensive tipping if you decide to keep using your vehicle for city trips."
53,347,"Apr 8 2008	Awesome Stay	We just completed our stay at the Fremont Hotel &amp; Casino and had a great time. The staff there was wonderful and went out of there way to assist us (we even had the Slot Floor Supervisor, Pam Carrollo search for my husband because she had accidentally done something wrong on his players card and wanted to correct it). Even the housekeeper on our floor was fun. Every morning when we left our room (still feeling the effects from the night before) she would greet us with a big smile and a huge &quot;GOOD MORNING&quot;, which made it a little easier to start our next day. The buffet was great and the casino offers exclusive table games which we found to be a blast. The room was a little small, but had everything we needed for our stay (including a view of Fremont Street). Can't wait to go back!!! Well worth the price!!!"
54,347,"Mar 27 2008 	More than Excellent!!!!	WOW!!!! We got a real cheap price using Kayak.com... Not expecting much, esp. from an older hotel/ casino, were we treated like royalty. Upon arrival, our vehicle was valet parked. At the desk, we were upgraded, w/o asking to a suite. Our accomodations were impeccable. We enjoyed our suite, the restaurant (an excellent buffet), and some gambling. Not once did we feel pressure to drink, gamble or partake in anything we did not feel comfortable doing. We felt absolutely at home and enjoyed everything offered. Would we stay there again? In a heartbeat! I am physically disabled and EVERYTHING was accessible."
55,347,"Mar 22 2008 	What a bargain!	We stayed 2 nights at the Fremont, March 16 and 17, 2008. We received a mailer based on past play, one night $29, one night free. You can't beat that, not during March Madness and St. Patrick's day.Upon arrival we found the check in and lobby area newly remodeled since our last visit of July 2007. It looked fresh and organized, friendly staff had us in our room on the 7th floor within minutes. We had a double room, non smoking, very clean, but small. That was OK with us as we are not ones to spread stuff out all over the place. The TV was old, but no worse than mine in the kitchen at home, LOL! It had the weather channel which is all we needed. The bedding was all white, very nice no stains, etc. I read another post where someone complained about the beds. We did not find them uncomfortable, in fact we slept like babies until the sun peeked thru the shutters about 10 am. In room safes are a nice plus too.The casino was fun; we found lots of slots that we enjoy playing.If we receive another offer for our July trip, we will be back."
56,347,"Mar 18 2008 	Terrible Experience	I travel to Vegas every two weeks and stay on Fremont quite often. The room was small and the TV outdated,especially compared to the 4 Queens just across the street. No inroom internet access and no room service made this feel like a 1950's trip. I caught a stomach virus and when requested late checkout I was told no twice. Finally a manager gave me 5pm,as my fever was over 100,but charged my 66$ for a few extra hours. If I had to stay here again, I would not go back to Vegas. It was that bad. The Manager at the front desk was far from professional,and should not be in her position. Stay elsewhere."
57,347,"Mar 15 2008 	Great Value Great Location Rooms are brand new Employees very nice	Stayed at the Fremont Feb 20-23, 2008. The room was newly remodled and very clean. Like everyone else says, the bathroom is small, but manageable. Only complaint about the room was the drain didnt drain well in the tub. My Wife and I loved the hotel and casino, everyone was very nice, and had great drink service. The Fremont is also right in the middle of the Fremont Experience, so you can walk everywhere without losing your breath (like on the strip). The valet parking is free and fast (make sure you throw them a buck or two when they give you your car), and it is easy to get to from the airport. We ate at the Tony Romas for dinner, for the $11 steak and lobster, which was great and couldnt beleive they dont charge more for it! We ate at the buffet once for breakfast, they have a big selection and cheap prices. We would defenitely stay there again. It was only $45/nt for the weeknights, and $110 for the friday we were there. Again, highly recommended!"
58,347,"Mar 3 2008 	Nice stay	We only stayed one night here, but we were very happy with the property. The front desk staff were all very friendly and checked us in very quickly. The room was nice. The bed was fairly comfortable, but the bathroom was a little small. That, to us wasn't a big deal. I was very happy with the room itself. No major complaints. We ate at the buffet for breakfast and it was wonderful. I would stay there again any time."
59,347,"Mar 2 2008 	Friendly environment	The Hotel must have been recently renovated. The bedroom they gave us was on the 7th floor. Fremont St was visible, however, the music was minimal. Also we had a great view of the surrounding mountains. It was a nicely decorated bedroom and had ample space. The bathroom, however, was on the small side. We were greeted by the friendliest staff at check-in. Most of the patrons were elderly (My GF and I are in our 20s) but it was suprisingly fun considering most people were helpful with the games we were playing. I would def stay here again. Just to experience Old Las Vegas far from the modern glitz. It was convenient to the Fremont St experience and other establishments. And the price was great."
60,347,"Feb 27 2008 	Nice hotel but I wouldn't stay there again	My husband and I stayed at the Fremont for several days for our anniversary. We prefer the charm and ease of downtown to the glitz and glamour of the strip. I had heard that the Fremont had been remodeled, which is primarily the reason I wanted to stay there. Upon entering the hotel room, I was pleased with the decor. The furniture is new and the bedding and textiles are very modern and appealing, although the chair (and there is only one) was somewhat dirty. The bathrooms are very small, only allowing room enough for one person to be in there at the time, but that wasn't a problem for us. The bathtub was nice and spacious, so that was a plus. The real problems began at night when it was time to sleep. The bed was as hard as a rock. You would think with the money the hotel spent to upgrade the rooms, that they could have also splurged and upgraded the old matresses, but that didn't appear to be the case. Not only was the bed terribly uncomfortable, but the pillows were as well. The bedding was not user friendly at all, as the bedding consisted of a white flat sheet, covered with a cheap mock feather down blanket, topped with another white flat sheet. It may sound silly, but it was hard to keep the bedding straight with the 2 white sheets and white blanket. I am normally a person who sleeps in but I was up at 6:00am that first morning and couldn't wait to get out of the bed. My husband and I both had said we woke up every half hour of the night in discomfort. The next night was slightly easier since we knew what to expect, but again, I woke up stiff and in pain.I know people say they don't need a comfortable bed in Vegas because you don't really sleep much, but trust me, you do! Aside from the uncomfortable bed, small bathroom and lack of usable furniture, the hotel was nice. We ate at the Paradise Buffet twice for breakfast and although the service wasn't great, you can't beat an all you can eat breakfast for 6 bucks! The hotel employees seemed nice, although my interraction with them was brief upon checking in. If you want a tasefully decorated room in a fun Casino and don't mind cramped quarters and a board-like bed, then the Fremont is for you. But being a person who values sleep and comfort, I won't stay here again."
61,347,"Feb 21 2008 	Great place to stay eat 	I stay at the Fremont 3-4 times a year. Just recently had to stay at Ballys (because of business) and I would have rather stayed at this favorite. The rooms have been remodeled, the buffet is one of the best in downtown. They even have a Zagat-rated restaurant with a phenomental T-bone steak dinner deal. It's conveniently located where I can walk to the Walgreens, movie theaters, other hotel casinos (try the Main St Hotel buffet...), and I can walk one block to the bus station and go to the strip for $2.In the past year, I've stayed at the Venetian, Treasure Island, Ballys and the LV Hilton. The small-town atmosphere of this hotel and casino keeps me coming back. Where else can you find $5 blackjack/craps tables, friendly dealers, waitresses and hosts? I'm a $5-10 BJ player and I get full room comps. The strip hotels don't even want to see your players card unless you're playing at $25 a hand. They've got a lot of the new slots, but if your luck turns bad or want a different machine, the other downtown casinos are literally 20 steps away.I hope that not too many will read this review, because if this little secret gets out, it will make it harder for me to get a room there when I'm in town."
62,347,"Feb 10 2008 	Good location great casino	The room was average, but the staff was friendly and the casino was great. We would stay here again."
63,347,"Feb 10 2008 	Nice hotel and casino- Great Value!!	Okay okay, I know the Golden Nugget is the &quot;best&quot; place to stay downtown. But with the prices they were charging, I decided to go with the Fremont for about half. Well let me say that we came here from two nights at the Flamingo and this was a welcome change! The whole property has recently been redone. Everything is kind of retro-modern in the decor. The rooms were in very nice shape and the casino and lobby areas were clean, fresh, and nicely decorated. I was really impressed.We checked in early, they had a room for us immediately. Do not be expecting any 'views' from the hotel, but we could see Binion's out our window and part of the Fremont Street Experience. The windows opened, too which was very useful. The room is on the small side, but plenty for two people. Bathroom is admittedly cramped, but functional. The food at the Buffet is above average in my opinion, and for the price it has real value. Dinner was $28 for me and my hubby. They had made to order steaks, a carving station, wide selection of seafood and fish, desserts, etc. We ate here twice. The Lenai Express place had some Asian dishes and quickie type food. We also ate at Tony Roma's, again great, and between 4:30 and 7:30 they have a full prime rib dinner for $8! Very good and again great value. Oh and don't miss the $1 margarita's at the casino bar!Downtown Vegas itself has pros and cons. The police are out everywhere, so as long as you stick to the main &quot;drag&quot; you will be safe. That being said, there are more &quot;undesirables&quot; hanging around the casinos than on the strip. I am not a prejudiced or snobby person, but you can tell when a homeless guy gets a buck and comes and sits next to you at a slot. But again, security in the casinos was great, and a once I saw a pit boss ask a guy to leave cause he was sleeping at the blackjack table. Considering the price and the actual size of the property, I was really happy with our stay here. The casino was larger than I thought it would be and even larger than some of the neighboring hotels (Las Vegas Club, 4 Queens). Comparing the Fremont to the other hotels nearby, I am glad I decided to stay here. Everything was new, fresh, service was great and I took some money home! Will stay here again if we decide to visit Downtown Vegas on our next trip."
64,347,"Feb 3 2008 	good experience at the Fremont	stayed at the Fremont the last time in vegas. We have always loved the downtown area- it has the feel of living in a small town very close to a huge city. The fremont was clean &amp; the rooms are very small but functional. There are tub/shower combos in the rooms. We got a very good deal on the room (like $32 a night). Ate at the Second Street Grill- the steaks were very good &amp; the setting was dark &amp; romantic. The cost was under $100 for meal, a drink &amp; spilt a dessert. Also, ate breakfast at the buffet- it was decent for a regular breakfast.The Fremont even took care of us when our flight was cancelled &amp; we had to stay an extra night."
65,347,"Jan 31 2008 	Great ""Mid Canopy"" Downtown Hotel 	This was my first stay at the Fremont. I like the 4 Queens but I like trying a different hotel each trip which is why I normally split my stays between at least 2 hotels. I found a great rate over MLK weekend, Friday and Saturday at $40 per night. Arrived very late in the evening and check-in was a breeze and the registration clerk was very helpful and friendly. Lobby looks to be newly renovated. Room was just a little on the small side but how much room can one person take up! Room was very clean, nicely furnished and the heat/ac worked just fine. Boyd needs to add a coffee maker to the rooms though. I hate trecking through a casino for a cup of coffee. The hallways were very quiet which made for some good sleeping. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants so I can't comment on that. Their cocktail/drink service could be a lot better, few and far between. Overall, I liked the Fremont and would definately stay there again. Downtown is so much fun!"
66,347,"Jan 28 2008 	Great Value for the $$	I had a non-smoking room with a king bed. The room seemed to be recently renovated and the furnishings were reminiscent of those boutique hotels that are cropping up in the big cities. I was very impressed with the bed linens, none of those ubiquitous polyester bedcovers (see picture). The bed was firm but not hard. The room was small (but not European small) with enough room for two people. The bathroom counter and sink was below standard U.S. heights. I'm 5 foot 4 inches and I felt like a giant in there. The towels were neither threadbare nor fluffy and they did the job they were designed do. My room overlooked the Fremont Street Experience and I could hear a constant hum/thrum in the room at nights. The television small with limited free stations. I would like to have a better selection of channels. An mini-refigerator and a cofee maker would also have been nice. The only area in the room that didn't seem updated was where the luggage, clothes hangers and iron/ironing board were stored (see picture). There was also a &quot;safebox&quot; that locked with a key. It was pretty flimsy by way of a safe, but at least you could lock up any valuables.I had breakfast and dinner at the Paradise Buffet which served mediocre to average fare. I feel I got a good value for the price paid -- better ambience compared to a similarly priced (overpriced) property like Best Western, Ramada Inn, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn and others of that calibre."
67,347,"Jan 17 2008 	Handy to Everything!!	Stayed at the Fremont Jan.5-9, 2008. We arrived by 11am and the front desk had our room ready. We have stayed on the strip and usually at the Golden Nugget but decided to try the Fremont. What a great choice me made. All personel were very friendly and willing to help from the front desk, house cleaning to the bell hop. Such a great location as you can be on Fremont Steet in seconds. We ate at the Paradise buffet for breakfast and dinner and found it to be a wonderful bargin. A Sams Town shuttle bus stops at the side door, by schedule all day long. Great fun to go there as Sams even has a movie theater which we went to - got us away from the machines. Yes, the room are small but the bed is great. We kept the widow open all day for fresh air and never needed any heat. If you want a nice, clean room at an easy to get around place then this is for you!! We would stay there again, no question. If you want big and fancy do yourself a favor and don't stay here, you will be unhappy!!"
68,347,"Jan 13 2008 	A Perfect Fit	I just spent six days at The Fremont and was delighted that there is still a truly friendly place left in Las Vegas. Every employee I had contact with was kind, helpful and eager to meet my needs. This was everyone from management to custodian. As the owner of a lodging establishment I can only tell you that this seems to be almost impossible to achieve.Rooms are newly updated and well kept plus very quiet. The bathroom may be a bit small for some but served me just fine.Housekeeping staff could not do more to make sure my needs were met, they asked me, not the other way around.Had my best meal in Las Vegas at The Second Street Grill inside The Fremont. Please do yourself a big favor and order the Sizzling Spinach Salad, a meal onto itself.My first time to stay downtown in &quot;Glitter Gulch&quot; on the Fremont Experience. I will not return to The Strip again. Great security and well maintained area, no people pushing all the nudey cards at you that just litter the strip. Plus it is very easy to get around, public transportation readily available, or easy freeway access just blocks away."
69,347,"Jan 13 2008	Disgusting--Don't set foot in the place	This joint is so old it is disgusting, dirty and things are falling apart, not to mention the ventilation system. The rooms are very small and musty smelling. The right hand/cold water faucet on our sink broke off and the shower/tub was filthy...you turned on the water and the bottom became dangerously slippery. Then, we tried to turn on the 60's thermostat and once the fan came on, my husband went into a violent coughing attack because so much dust blew out of the vents and into the room.This place needs to be imploded NOW."
70,347,"Jan 6 2008 	Our favorite hotel/casino in Vegas!	Let me start out by stating that we prefer Downtown to any other area of Vegas. While not as glitzy or ritzy, it has a more authentic, old-school feeling than the Disnyfied Strip that is more geared to adults than to families. That being said, the accomodations are generally not as luxurious as those found on the Strip, but there are several clean and comfortable hotels to choose from. But, who goes to Vegas to hang out in their hotel room anyway?We have stayed/played at the Fremont many times and always have a great time! We usually receive comps to stay there for free, but even if we don't have comps, it is our first choice of places to stay/play downtown. When we were planning our wedding (7/7/07 - an incredibly busy time in Vegas), I called the Fremont because they were sold out and we had no offers for that weekend. We were willing to pay for a room to stay there (over all other downtown hotels which had availability). When I told them that we had become engaged in their casino during our previous stay and that we were returning to Vegas to get married and would rather pay full rate to stay at the Fremont instead of any other hotel (many which had availability), they not only made room for us, but they comped our stay! This is indicative of the level of customer service and the generally warmer, more intimate atmosphere at the Fremont that keeps us coming back for more.The hotel was recently renovated and the rooms, while not expansive, are tasteful, clean, and cozy. We are always quite comfortable there. The check-in is quick and easy, and we always find the staff to be very accomodating.We always have a great time in the casino and rarely venture out to play elsewhere. The cocktail service is generally reliable, and the cocktail waitresses are friendly (Remember to tip your server! These ladies work hard!). Sometimes we win...sometimes we don't; however, we generally feel like we get decent play for our money (as opposed to some casinos that seem to suck the money out of our wallets).We have eaten weekend brunch there many times (champagne brunch on Saturdays and Sundays). While the selection is not overwhealming (as in some of the strip buffets) they hit the right notes. There is a carving station, omlette bar, cold seafood selection, salad bar, the usual breakfast selections, and some other various hot/cold foods. The food always hits the spot, and the servers aren't stingy with the champagne. Plus the price can't be beat!We've also dined at the Second Street Grill (the upscale restaurant in the center of the casino). This is one of the better restaurants in the downtown area. The menu leans toward &quot;pacific rim&quot; but also offers steaks and other more &quot;traditional&quot; dishes. The food is delicious and high-quality, the presentation is beautiful, and the room is warm and intimate. We have stayed at almost all the other hotels downtown (including the Golden Nugget [the most upscale hotel, but we found it to be large and impersonal and a bit snooty and wannabe strip-like], the Plaza [mixed experiences - it's been a while, but it felt a bit gritty back in the day], Vegas Club [OK rooms but lacks personality], Golden Gate [really quaint and cozy in a bygone ere kind of way and great shrimp cocktails], Four Queens [again, nice rooms but slightly impersonal], Binions [not the same since it lost the &quot;Horseshoe&quot;, the Benny's Natural breakfast special and the million dollar display], the Fitz [OK but generic], and Lady Luck [before it closed]) but our first choice for playing and staying downtown is easily the Fremont!"
71,347,"Dec 24 2007 	Nice place for the money	We stayed at the Fremont Hotel for two nights, 12/19 and 12/20. Upon entering the room we noticed that it was on the smaller side. However, it looked as though it had totally been redone recently. The room was updated and looked very nice. The bathroom was also very small, but also looked as if had recently been updated. The room was very clean and comfortable. We slept well on the bed and the room was quiet. Although we didn't have the greatest view, we got what we asked for, a king bed in a non smoking room. For the short amount of time we spent in the room, the view didn't matter. Everybody from the check in staff, to the valet to the cleaning staff were all very pleasent and nice. We have stayed on the strip many times, but looked to save a few bucks on the room for extra gambling money by staying downtown. We are glad that we did, and would stay at the Fremont again. It is not a mega resort with glitsy shows and sights, but is more than sufficient if you want a clean cheaper priced room to sleep in down town. Give it a shot if you plan on trying a stay downtown. The casino was also decent, however there is no poker room. We enjoyed the dowtown atmosphere for gambling, and took a drive to the strip to see a show, but returned downtown for a cheaper gamble. We will be back to the Fremont."
72,347,"Nov 11 2007 	Excellent stay at the Fremont	I took a solo trip to LV and stayed at the Fremont for three comped nights from November 6-9. I was in Room 418 near the elevator. The room was very clean with a comfortable King bed. I stay often at the Fremont and am always satisfied with my visits there. The room is not large, and the bathroom is small, but I consider the Fremont to be an excellent value Downtown. The housekeeping is very good with helpful and friendly staff. I look forward to my next stay at the Fremont."
73,347,"Oct 12 2007 	Great value Downtown	Having stayed at the Golden Nugget last time we stayed Downtown, we though we'd try out the Fremont and I have to stay it was excellent value for money. Ok - so the casino is a bit dowdy but the check-in was effortless and the room itself clean and comfortable. The bathroom size was smallish but everything functioned satisfactorily. Considering the price we paid, we could not have hoped for better.We would happily recommend the hotel to anyone staying downtown."
74,347,"Sep 14 2007	had a great time	I received my stay as a free comp in the mail. Was surprised to receive a 5 day 4 nite stay. But I took them up on it and am very glad I did. The room was small, but very clean, anyway thats all anyone needs. Only used it to clean up and sleep. Nice comfortable bed and pillows and new furnishings. It was always made up and cleaned early every day. We got there early and was able to check in right away which was great. The buffet was excellent. I enjoyed staying on Fremont street, much better than the strip. Its like a big party every nite. So much to see, without all the walking. Thank you Fremont for the invite. I hope to return."
75,347,Sep 5 2007 	Geat location. Great price	This hotel was provided for in a package deal from Vacations Hawaii so the price was a excellent. The room was clean and the staff members were friendly though the hotel's parking only allows for valet parking. Sorry no self parking.Would definately stay here again due to the price and downtown location.
76,347,"Jul 31 2007 	A Decent Bargain Hotel	I had a room at the Flamingo booked for July 22-25 (Sun --Wed) for a great rate of $60/night. However, most of the hotels on the strip (and many off of the strip) were running $120-$250 for Saturday, July 21. I was traveling with my wife and we both realized that this was waaaay too much to pay for a room when that we would spend so little time in. My first thought was the Orleans, but their rooms were running around $120/night for a Saturday stay. With this in mind, I checked around and found a $60/night rate at the Fremont. We had never stayed downtown before but figured we would give it a try....As others have stated, the room itself was clean and VERY small. Some of the furniture looked updated, but gernally speaking, the room itself was VERY old and dated looking (same for the hallways and common areas). The a/c worked ok but not great and the T.V. got very few channles. However, none of this was very important because after a long day of traveling all we did was fall asleep anyway.In summary, If you're looking for BASIC accomodations at a bargain price in downtown Vegas I think the Fremont fits the bill without a problem. I think if I find myself in the same siutation again I will try the El Cortez or head out to a &quot;local&quot; spot like Sam's Town for the one night stay."
77,347,"Jul 31 2007	Fremont Hotel	Stayed at the &quot;Fremont for the second time. Not a negative thing to say. Hotel staff very accomadating. We asked for a king non smoking room. It was small but very nice. Comfortable bed and nice linens. We were asked what part of the hotel we would like. I asked for a room away from the Fremont exxperience where it would be quiet. That was not a problem. Never heard any noise. The room attendent was very good. We have no problem with the Fremont and would stay there again. Love downtown. It is very fun and cozy. The strip is fun for us to visit, but not to swtay there."
78,347,"Jul 28 2007 	The All NEW Fremont!	OK, I got to admit, I like dirty, dingy, downtown Vegas. I like to play awhile at one place and then move on to the next place, all without breaking a sweat!I have stayed in lots of Vegas hotels and when I stay and play downtown, I end up at either the Fremont or the Golden Nugget. This last visit we stayed at a comped room at the newly renovated Fremont. No, the casino, lobby and main areas are all the same, but the rooms have all been tastefully redone and they are very, very nice.Subtle tones, new bedding, and a shower curtain rod that keeps the curtain from flying all over the place during a shower.Sure the Fremont isn't the Wynn, nor does it try to be. The rooms are tiny and old Vegas. Back in the day players weren't expected to stay in their rooms, they were expected to be on the casino floor, so the old rooms are small. But hey, they are really clean, nicely redecorated, comfortable and cheap.If you want the big mega tourist resorts, stick to the Strip. But if you want that old Vegas feeling, check out the newly renovated Fremont."
79,347,"Jul 8 2007	Loved the Fremond	This was the best hotel I've ever stayed in Las Vegas! Never had stayed downtown and I will only stay at the Fremont when I return to Vegas! The location was excellent and the room was exceptionally clean! The blinds were a great alternative to curtains!! The room was quiet and just perfect!!!! I can't wait to stay there again!! Taxis were easy to find to get to go the strip! The food choices were so much better downtown and the prices were so reasonable! Also, the security was very visable not only in the hotel but the entire downtown area!! Highly recommend the Fremont!! My new home in Las Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
80,347,"Jun 23 2007 	Great For One Person	I found the room to be small, but comfortable and very clean. The remodeled room is soothing and quiet. Nice textures. I was one person in the room, and just right for me, with a king-size bed, chair and ottoman. I think it would be fine for a couple that doesn't need to spread out. In my opinion, it would be too smallfor people needing two double beds.The bathroom is very small. Think &quot;cruise ship with a tub&quot;. Again, perfectly fine for me as a solo. Or anyone who just wants the basics and no need to spread out.Dining is not an issue. Nice buffet, coffee shop, Tony Roma, and plenty of other dining options just steps away at the other casinos.The only thing I'd like to change in the room is to have the air conditioner blow out into the room, not just up to the ceiling in front of the window. But, as long as I left the air on low cool all day, it was comfortable when coming back to the room."
81,347,"Jun 3 2007 	Great place to stay	This hotel was great. The valet and registration attendants were very friendly. The rooms were all redone a year ago and were very nice. Nice comfy bed, nice bathroom, etc. Really enjoyed staying here in the downtown atmosphere. They also share a pool with the California hotel across the street-very easy to get to and easy to use. Would definitely recommend this hotel!"
82,347,"May 23 2007 	not as bad as I expected	I ended up staying here one night on a business trip because all the other hotels were booked or way too expensive. It was $80 and based on the reviews here I thought it couldn't be too bad. The valet parking, hotel registration, and elevators were very conveniently located. They upgraded me to a suite, which was unfortunately right next to the elevators. The suite was small but quaintly furnished, very cute. You can tell the rooms are old, the bathroom is tiny, but they have tried to update it with modern decor. No room service, so I had to eat at the cafe. I had the Singapore Noodles, very good. For some reason the restaurant was not open at 6:45 when I came down for breakfast so I went across the street to the Starbucks at the Golden Nugget."
83,347,"May 8 2007 	4th time we've stayed!	We come to LasVegas at least twice a year. The past 2 years we have stayed at the Fremont! Nothing fancy but, everything we need. The staff is very friendly &amp; helpful. We ALWAYS do better at the slots atthe Fremont than we have ever done anywhere else! The buffett was good &amp; Had good service at the steak house! We love the atmosphere at &quot;Fremont Street&quot; - layed back &amp; comfortable!! We take the shuttle to the Strip a couple of days &amp; enjoy that also but, Really Love Fremont Street!! It's an experience!! Can't wait to come back and stay in November!!"
84,347,"Apr 15 2007 	Good Deal at Fremont	Stayed a the Fremont April 10-13, 2007. No charge for room under the April Slot Marathon promotion recieved in the mail. We have gambled at the Fremont before, but this was our first stay. No complaints, great at the price!Quick and easy check in at 2:00 PM on Tuesday afternoon. No self parking, valet only, but quick service, never waited more than a couple minutes for the car. Room 1127 was a few doors down from the elevator. Yes, the rooms are small, but they are nicely decorated, and are well appointed. Comfortable bed, no charge wall safe, hair dryer, ironing board and iron. King size bed was very comfortable, and the pillows very soft, we each needed two each, provided very cheerfully by the maid. The TV has only a few channels, but they are the most needed by a traveler, TWC and CNN and the local channels. Who needs a TV in Vegas other than to check the weather? The AC/heater worked fine, and was just loud enough to screen any incidentalnoise from the hall.The bathroom is also small, one person at a time, but everything is clean and functional. Good water pressure, and the shower head was plenty high enough for me (5'10&quot;).The decor in the rooms has a retro 50's feel. Especially the carpet. But it works and looks great! Everything was clean and fuctional. Thestaff was pleasant and helpful. We would definitly stay at the Fremont again. It's not the Bellagio, but is a great value for a stay downtown.p_jay2001"
85,347,"Apr 3 2007 	Clean Cheap but not Glamorous!!!!	This was my first trip to Las Vegas and my friend and I stayed for two nights at the Fremont. The hotel was what I was looking for - inexpensive. Overall, the rooms were pretty clean and I liked the recent renovation. HOWEVER, if you are looking for an exciting casino/hotel with good amenities I would definitely NOT recommend staying at the Fremont. I wish the room would have been brighter. I was also disappointed by the lack of channels on cable for when I woke up with a hangover :)I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap stay downtown. I would recommend Paris Las Vegas if you're looking to spend a little extra to stay in a posh place with young people aroundyou."
86,347,"Mar 25 2007 	Nice hotel for the price	This hotel reminds me of an upgraded Days Inn. We had room 1007. Very clean. Two double beds. We arrived at 11:30 pm and there were people still at the front desk. Very quick check in. Bathroom was tiny. Two people can't stand in there comfortably at the same time. Shower was very good, great water pressure.Sheets were clean. They have a sign in the bathroom that if you take the towels, pillows, or washcloths you will be billed a fee that ranges from $10 - $40. I think they were serious. LOL. The pillows are down and very soft, so I can see where someone might want to steal them. Requests for extra pillows, towels, etc was met with cheerful politeness. Everyone was so darn nice!! It was refreshing. We didn't eat at any of the hotels restaurants but I did get a snack at the Lanai express at 4am. I had the best burger and fries. Between the hours of 12am to 7am they serve a limited menu of breakfast and burgers etc. Great for when you finally look at your watch and realize you missed all of the regular restaurants.Overall a great stay. If you get a players card they will probably hit your email up for offers."
87,347,"Mar 11 2007	more than slow ribs.............	sigh............... a 2 1/2 hour wait to eat at Tony Roma's with one poor waitress trying to take care of the whole room. The Paradise Buffet was great with such a cute waitress. Thank you Ana! The Fremont refused to cash my company (My Company) check, but it was a short two blocks to B of A. It was my first time at the Fremont and my first time to Vegas in about 20 years, what a change! One of the cocktail waitresses had a terrible attitude at the tables with a lady and one of our party and the girl at the front desk was more than unhelpful when I brought up my check dilemna. salt and peppa vacation wrecka..............."
