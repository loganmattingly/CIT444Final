39,1927,"Dec 27 2007	Fantastic!	The hotel was clean, in a good location, and though small, updated and modern. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was well maintained, and there was even a flat screen. For the money, I would certainly stay there again."
40,1927,"Dec 6 2007	Managers attitude	The manager David( not sure of surname) was very unhelpful, obnoxoius and unpleasant to his staff.The rooms were very small for 4 people but were clean, rest of the staff were very nice, especially Ralph, Alan &amp; Vanessa"
41,1927,"Nov 19 2007 	Really liked my stay here	Staff was friendly - new to the city, I was given a subway line tutorial and and nice map pf Manhattan. Room was small but nicely furnished - large bed - great free standing closet and flat screen TV!Bathroom had nice space - shower was nice - very clean!Nice place to relax after a very busy day spent playing tourist!"
42,1927,"Nov 2 2007 	David is great! The rooms good!	Unfortunately I booked this hotel through HOTELS.COM and they screwed up my ENTIRE reservation. (Corporate rooms, 20/ALL WRONG). Even though I had confirmation before hand many times, every single one of my reservations was completely wrong upon arrival. (I was even jipped one of my rooms after paying in-advance over $40,000!)The saving grace: 1) The location to the Javits Center is INCREDIBLE2) David--front desk....who went out of his way to completely make everything better. (Including walking to the Javits Center while I was in the middle of running an event to make sure I had everything I needed!!3) The rooms/price. Very beautiful re-done lobby. 4 rooms per floor, but decent sized for New York--Times Square was a really quick walk away!!!The bad:1) A certain un-named incompetent and unsympathetic front-desk staffer2) hotels.com3) No breakfastPlease feel free to contact me for more details. I will never use hotels.com again to book group reservations! However, the Gem is a true Gem so I didn't let that effect our companies stay. Thanks David! :)"
43,1927,"Nov 1 2007 	Perfect for overnight stay.	Stayed there for 1 night in Oct. 2007..Hotel room is very small, however bathroom was very clean and modern. FlatScreen TV is new..Overnight parking was $35 at lot across the street. My wife was happy and she is extrememly fussy. I am just not used to the small NYC type hotel room but it was okay for one night and if you don't stay in the room much..10 minute walk to 34th street, Madision Squre Garden and Macys..A little creepy to walk back to the hotel from the theater district in the evening..Use a taxi or drive..Overall for a one night stay it is fine and recommended if you don't want a fancy 5 star hotel."
44,1927,"Sep 2 2007	Off the beaten path	Got a great price from Hotwire. But too much off the beaten path for me.Location: two and half blocks from the subway on 8th Ave.If you don't mind spending money to catch a cab back at night, this place may be for you. Or if you need to save money, walk back very quickly and avoid the group of people hanging out throughout the night across the street.Enjoyed the room though. The bed, had a safe, flat screen tv, nice bath ammenities, nice sized bathroom....The night time guy at the front desk was very helpful and pleasant. The early Morning crew was seen hanging with their dates in front of the hotel. One women still managed to blurt out good morning to me. On my check out day, the guy checked me out and gave me a paper to read."
45,1927,"Jul 16 2007 	Slept well at the HoJo	The Howard Johnson was a great place to stay for us because we were on a limited budget. The staff was great and VERY helpful. They helped us navigate our way through the city and gave us great advice on how to get back to the airport for our departure. Since the hotel is relatively new, the rooms were fantastic. They each had a new flatscreen tv and were decorated in modern black and white. They were small, but it's NYC... we spent the majority of our time sight seeing. We didn't care about the size of our room. The only thing we did in our room was sleep and the beds were clean and comfortable... and the rooms were quiet.The only slightly negative side to staying at this hotel was that it is located about a mile from Time's Square. If you are planning on staying out late night... you can take the subway to Time's Square and then take a $5 cab ride to the hotel. We did that to be safe. The hotel was clean and great for travelers on a budget. I would stay there again."
46,1927,"Jun 17 2007 	Great hotel ok location breakfast could be better	My wife and I stayed at the Howard Johnson Midtown Manhattan from June 4th until the 10th 2007. After reading the reviews we were a little bit concerned, not too much though. When entering the hotel it felt good already and in the room all doubt was gone. It was great. The rooms are not too big, but remember, you are in Manhattan, New York. All two, three star hotels have rooms of similar size. This is not the Waldorf Astoria!BEDThe hotel is pretty new which makes all thing neat. They offer several bed sizes. Our room (#904) offered a king-size bed and four pillows. Placing them next to each other fits the width of the bed. I guess the length is 2 meters. It was a large bed, laying comfortably, making one sleep absolutely well. The spacing around the bed is not too much, just enough to get out and into the bed at the side. DESK/ TV/ PHONE/ INTERNETAt the foot of the bed a desk is located, of an appropriate size. If one would really want to work there, the space is not really comfortably, when it comes to getting seated as well as the work space at the desk itself. But occasionally will give no real problem and for just placing your stuff on the desk, it suits. A coffeemaker is located in the desk. A great flat TV is hanging on the wall above the desk and two phones are available (desk and bed). Complimentary Internet excess in the room is available (use your own laptop). It is wired and a cable long enough to sit on the bed is available from the drawer of the desk.CLOSET/ SAFE/FLAT-IRONThe closet is not big either, but more than enough for two people to put their clothes in, needed for one week. It offers two drawers, and of course a part to hang your clothes. One can put his suite case on top of the closet. A flat-iron is located in the closet, ironing boards are located in the fire escape.A safe with electronic PIN lock is complimentary and placed in the closet. It fits a laptop.A/C UNITThe airco unit can also be used as a heater. We only used it as an A/C. It switches on and off depending on the temperature. Although not having it switched on all night (and/ or day) is really great for the environment, we thought it was a bit annoying to sometimes be woken up in the middle of the night when the A/C switched on. But referring to the time before going to sleep, it must have switched on and off many times a night, so I guess the only time we really woke up, was when we already needed to go to the toilet. The window can be tilted open lateral.BATHROOMThe bathroom is of an appropriate size and large enough to have two grown-ups brushing teeth together. The holder of the toilet-paper in our room was hanging loose. We didnt mentioned it, but after two or three days it was repaired. The shower is good, constant temperature and a firm jet.BREAKFASTAs mentioned in some other reviews the breakfast was not too great. Located in the cellar and offering several muffins, cereals, coffee, tea, orange juice and apple juice. We thought the location of the cellar was not too bad, it is not really great either. But mostly, the housekeeping staff were also responsible for keeping the breakfast in a good state. That means, they kept an eye on the amount of muffins and all, while, at another corner of the cellar, preparing the bedclothes and towels for cleaning the rooms later on. It were clean bedclothes though. The breakfast could be better and in a better place. Even though it is rare for a hotel to serve breakfast in NYC, when doing so, do it good!Coffee and tea is served all day. But one morning after breakfast, the coffee was done. And when I say done, I really mean done. No coffee available to refill the machine with. I think that is a lack of planning and bad service.LOCATIONThe hotel is a bit off the beaten track, but well enough to walk to Times Square (a little under 15 min) and Penn(sylvania) Station offering Subway and trains (10 min walk). One day we even walked to Fifth Ave and up to Central Park. The ramp of the Lincoln Tunnel makes no problem and with the window of the room closed, one doesnt hear any annoying sounds from outside.FRIENDLYNESSWe thought the personnel were friendly and helpful. When checking in we met Alan (great guy!) who gave us a map of New York City and the subway and later that week some hints about what to see in the Big Apple. All other staff were friendly as well.SUMMARYWe loved the Howard Johnson Midtown Manhattan for its cleanliness (I have asthma so a clean hotel is very important and I had no problem in the HoJo), all was new. A bit off the beaten track may be somewhat sadly, but is no real problem. The breakfast and friendliness of the housekeeping staff (breakfast as well) could be better. This hotel is absolutely worth the money! We would definitely return.See our posted candid traveler photos. For questions, dont hesitate to contact us."
47,1927,"May 29 2007 	Excellent! Will definetly return.	I stayed at the Howard Johnson Midtown May 14th through the 18th. The room was delightful for a budget hotel. It had two beds, a desk, a flat TV hanging on the wall, and two phones (one cordless). It was very clean and comfy. The hotel is a little bit off the beaten path, but at night it was quiet and there were no disturbances. The subway was a short walk away (about 5 blocks or so). The staff was really nice, especially the girl at the front desk (I believe her name was Vanessa). They were really helpful and chatty. As others have said, the breakfast area isn't very nice, but it did the job. They had some muffins, some cereal, coffee, and orange juice and apple juice. Overall, for what I paid, I was really satisfied and will definetly return."

63,1927,May 9 2008 	Molto carino
1,1934,"Nov 19 2009 	Great Hotel if you know a few things	First be sure you are GUARANTEED to be on the side of the hotel away from the bridge. If you face the bridge it is very noisy and you maybe very upset. Second know that you are in Chinatown. I love Chinatown and needed to stay in lower manhattan but it is a bit out of the way for some people. It is very clean, new and the customer service is great. It is however minimalist. You get everything you need but not a thing more. There is no wireless - there is hard wired DSL and in our room the cable was next to the phone on a TINY night stand with a short cable. We had two queen beds and the room was quite large. The desk was also tiny. The free coffee in the lobby is instant coffee and hot water.Cabs are fairly easy to get in China"
2,1934,"Nov 14 2009 	Surprisingly nice!	In the middle of bustling Chinatown is Hotel 91. Immediately surprised by its cleanliness and comfortable beds! The property has a very &quot;fresh&quot; feel. Our room had 2 double beds (they reminded us of the Westin's &quot;Heavenly Beds&quot;. A/C was very quiet and efficient, plenty of hot water, free high speed ethernet, flat screen tv. Overall room size was a bit small, the window view on the 6th floor was the traffic/train of the Manhattan Bridge (almost touching distance!). A bit noisy, but the double-paned windows helped and it didn't interrupt sleep. No fridge, We only saw Chinese food nearby (Starbucks about 1/2 mile away). &quot;Complimentary coffee and tea&quot; on 2nd floor was a hot pot with instant Folgers or tea bags.Walking distance to the Brooklyn Bridge, Ground Zero.Good value for money. Nice and helpful staff.Parking at $32/day on Henry St (near the backdoor entrance to hotel)."
3,1934,"Nov 7 2009 	Solid value for money	This hotel is not fancy or anything but the location is great and the room is good. You only get a room and some vending machines - no restaurant/bar or room service - but that's all you really need. No bedbugs and the room is cleaned every day. I got an offer on the room (104 $/night) and the price was definitely right.The hotel is smack down in Chinatown which worked for me since I spent most my time in LES and the Chinese surroundings is a good experience - like being in China actually. :-)I got a room right next to the the train track on Manhattan Bridge but was not disturbed by the noise even though the trains keeps at it all night. There's a double window frame so most of the noise is blocked out.You can find better hotels (but then again probably also more expensive) but definitely also worse, so Hotel 91 is worth a recommendation."
4,1934,"Sep 14 2009 	Clean Friendly 	Me &amp; my best friend took a 4 day trip to NYC. - Saw this place on line, booked it. - Got there and we were happily surprised to find how clean and nice it was inside. Everything seems new. The Staff is SUPER friendly, Didio was my favorite. ~ The rooms were perfect for 2 people, the beds ROCK, and although the train is nearby it wasn't bothersome at all (from Texas, just sounded like thunder to us). ~ The only downside is, if you are not gonna hang out downtown, you will have to travel a bit as the Hotel is pretty far from Midtown. BUT, they have their own Car Service and it IS cheaper than a Taxi to get anywhere you want to go. (Example, to Laguardia it was 35 bucks, a taxi cost us 45 on the way in). ~ They told us of all the great places to go &amp; see and how to get there on the Subway. The Staff just really knew their stuff. I would stay there again for sure! ~ Everyone we saw (other visitors) were nice and seemed pleased as well, there were people from all over the world there. - I HIGHLY recommend this place. (me &amp; my friend are females, mid 30's). You won't regret staying here, I promise."
5,1934,"Sep 11 2009 	Please Stay you will not regret it!!!	The reason we stayed here is because of the rate. We had a great time. The room very clean. The customer service was just pure de awesome. The thing that we did not like was that it was 4 of us and the room was very small. The noise did not bother us not one bit. Plenty of transportation service all around the area. No complaints what so ever and will stay there when we all go back to NEW YORK again. Thank You Hotel 91 for all your help. I wanted to take the bed home with me, it was so comfortable."
6,1934,"Sep 6 2009 	Great stay in a very convenient location	Hotel 91 is great. Not expensive -throught hotels.com- and so conviniently located at the heart of Manhattan. Chinatown is a great place to stay, very charming despite the fish smell in the streets. The room was clean and I almost didn't hear the noise from the bridge thanks to the double-double windows !"
7,1934,Aug 28 2009 	Great Place	stayed for 8 nights - the beds are great - the bathrooms clean... we faced the train and could hardly hear a thing... they provide a great lounge with free tea and coffee 24/7... It is right in the heart of Chinatown with a fish market on the street which adds to the local flavour. Canal Street is a short walk away. A brillant restaurant called Bacaro is in Division street a 2 minute walk away... well worth a visit !!!
8,1934,"Jul 15 2009 	Great value comfy beds no breakfast!	I've done a fair bit of travelling and for what I'd term as a budget hotel (compared with other hotels in New York) you're very well looked after and the rooms are very clean and comfortable.The only downside if I could pick anything is the location. There are subways to the rest of Manhattan from Chinatown but if you're wanting to go out in the evening for a drink near the hotel there really isn't anywhere.If you're walking towards City Hall (out of the main hotel door, turn left) however you will catch a glimpse of a &quot;Subway&quot; if you like your sandwiches - I think I've had about 5 from there and the staff were good.Great hotel for....- Sleeping (I want to take the bed home with me, the mattress is great)- Relaxing for short periods (they have a vending machine on the 4th floor for drinks/snacks)- Internet (ONLY if you bring your own laptop)...there's blue ethernet cables in the rooms and its free to use, however there is a communal PC on the 4th floor but you have to pay to use it (weird, really).Bad for...- If you have a late night there aren't any &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; hangers. So be prepared to make your own somehow or you'll have some aggressive banging on your door &quot;Housekeeping....housekeeping&quot; for 5 minutes straight. Worst of it all is you can't predict when they're coming it seems to vary. The only thing that stopped them getting in was locking the door.Looking at other reviews, my room faces the train bridge and it does sound a bit like distant thunder as they go by but unless you're a very light sleeper it's not going to affect you."
9,1934,"Jul 1 2009 	Great but one thing	I read reviews about this Hotel before I went. People complained about the train and noise. My hotel window faced the train. We heard it but it didn't bother us one bit. A long day in the city will make you want to come back and knock out. This hotel has the best , most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. I slept like a log. I usually have back pains in the morning but I had none when I woke up in this bed. AWESOME. The downside is that I had an orange stain on my sheets. I brought my own blanket so I didn't make a big deal out of it. Also, they don't have do not disturb signs so I made my own generic sign to put on the door. Also, there is one elevator and it was very slow. So if you're talking bad about the people that work at the front desk, be quiet when it stops on the 2nd floor looking right in to the front desk. Now last thing is, the 2 guy workers that were working the day I checked it. RUDE.... The asian guy with the long hair that thinks he's a big shot and looks like a wannabee action hero....BIG ZERO. He didn't even acknowledge us. I think he was too busy watching stuff on the computer. the white guy was Okie but he barely looked at us. They didn't even greet us when we got to the front desk. HOW RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We only saw them that afternoon. They are unprofessional and should not be working a customer service job. Other then that, Hotel 91 was good. AHAHHAHA... I would stay again but hopefully those workers are gone."
10,1934,"Jun 24 2009 	worst hotel service i have ever had	We had a terrible experience at this hotel. It does not look at all like the pics on the website! And yes, it is extremely loud because of proximity to bridge traffic. While the hotel does appear clean, I got a RASH from lying in the bed for 10 minutes. When we went to the desk, and asked if they might recommend another hotel in the area, the night shift clerk said that he couldn't say or he would be &quot;helping the competition.&quot; He was on his ipod, claiming there was &quot;nothing he could do.&quot; We were told that if we wanted to find another hotel we would have to PAY THREE DOLLARS TO USE THE COMPUTER IN THE HALL!! I have stayed in many hotels in my life and have never encountered anyone as rude and inhumane. When a representative from hotels.com called hotel 91 on our behalf (it was 1am and I had hives and no internet), he then reported to me that the hotel clerk had been rude to HIM and told him nasty things about ME! Please don't stay there."
11,1934,"Jun 11 2009 	nice location near LES shops and restaurants	We got a great deal on the room. So based on that alone I would probably stay here again if it was during the spring or fall. The hotel is no where near a subway stop. The closest one is the F train and that is about a 5 or 10 minute walk from the hotel. When I stayed there it was warm, so walking to the subway stop was no big deal, but I can imagine if it was 15 degrees out, I'd be singing a different tune.The hotel is underneath a bridge. So it can get pretty loud noise. I shut the bathroom door, which helped muffle the noise, and luckily my boyfriend and I are fairly deep sleepers. Overall clean hotel, but the bathroom seemed a little dated. There aren't a lot of bells and whistles to the place. It's in the middle of Chinatown, so if you don't like the smell of fish don't stay here. As there are Chinese markets with fish and dried fish galore. I didn't mind the smell because it reminds me of any big Asian metropolitan city.Is the best hotel to stay out in NYC? Probably not. Is it the worst? No."
12,1934,"Jun 3 2009 	NOISE	We stayed at the hotel for three nights. The room was very small. There was no free internet, no safe. The room is very basically equipped. The bathroom is good, but we had to ask for additional towels. Worst of all: it was EXTREMELY loud. No chance to get sleep without earplugs. Some members of the staff are friendly others definitely aren't."
13,1934,"May 21 2009 	The Coney Island Express Runs 1 Meter Behind the Hotel--- You Can Imagine What That's Like	***From the perspective of a 26 year old woman from Toronto who often visits NYC and primarily spends her time in the Lower East Side, DUMBO, checking out art galleries, shopping and dining out.  ---The Hotel---The Good:- It's modern and clean. Similar to any budget hotels, although it lacks a few amenities that I consider basic: wi-fi in the rooms, fridge, vending machines etc.,- The visitors are mainly Asian tourists and young travelers, both of which you hardly see or hear.The Bad:- Zero security: there are three entrances to the hotel and they are unmanned, the concierge is on a separate floor from the entrances, and anyone can walk-in any of those entrances and take the elevator to any floor in the hotel. There are also no security camera's.- It is 1 meter away from a busy bridge on which the Coney Island express runs and a major road runs underneath. It is extremely loud and the hotel shakes.- There is zero customer service, I personally am not very demanding and don't often need much, but this was ridiculous. The staff were not willing to help you out with anything, and/or did not now the answer to most of the questions asked and were surprised to be asked very basic questions, such as &quot;where can I buy some water?&quot;. ---The Area----The Good:- As far as lower east side hotels this one is fairly cheap and decent. It is close to Brooklyn and LES, and a short walk to the subway.The Bad:- This place is dead...DEAD(for emphasis) after 9 p.m. or so. Everything is boarded up and there is no where to grab a bite or buy snacks. Only the homeless roam the area after a certain hour, and although they are harmless, if your alone it can be unpleasant. - It is in China Town, so it is a bit dirty from the food stores. ---The Rooms---The Good:- They are typical of the price range, no frills, modest decor. This one is relatively new and things are kept very clean.-Bathroom en-suite, no sharing.The Bad:- They are small, the train running past is loud, the windows don't open.- We didn't really want to go back there much, and sometimes after a long day you need to re-charge for a bit before heading out again. ---The Price---- Overall it is not that cheap that it would be worthwhile staying here. I would recommend moving uptown or midtown to the cheaper hotels there, despite the less desirable location and being further from LES.- They charge you for storing your bag after checkout; I have never encountered this. They have this dingy internet access station where they charge you quite a lot for internet access."
14,1934,"Apr 30 2009 	Clean comfortable no frills NY on a budget hotel.	I read many of the reviews on this site about this hotel. I feel much the same as many, if you are looking for a five star experience then look near times square and the five star price tag. This is a no frills hotel that gives you a clean room to sleep in and a close stop to the subway. And on the note of the subway, we stayed on the track side of the hotel and there was track noise every 5-7 minutes or so, but neither one of thought it was really that loud. If you are a light sleeper then it might be somewhat annoying. The room was always clean, with fresh towels and folded linens. The rooms could have been a little better lit. There was only one floor lamp in the corner and lamp between the two beds.The staff was friendly and helpful. We asked for a authentic Chinese restaurant and she recommended one within walking distance. They also held our bags for after we checked out so we could continue to explore the city on our last day.Outside you are truly in Chinatown. There are vendors right on the street selling their wares. As in other reviews, there is a fish market near the end of the block with the smell of seafood but it is brief as you walk by. Overall, not a big deal.A couple of negatives. It is true that there aren't many &quot;american&quot; places to eat nearby. But we were never in that area much for it to be a factor. Also, anyone can enter the hotel through the front door. A doorman or key card would alleviate any concerns. But we never felt unsafe while staying here.Overall, it was a wonderful experience staying here and I would recommend this hotel to a friend. If you want to explore the city on a budget and stay in a solid, quality hotel, then this is the place for you."
15,1934,"Apr 29 2009 	Better Late Than Never (I was waiting on a Pic) :-(	My two grown daughters and I booked Hotel 91 after reading reviews and knowing that it was almost a new property - The price was also a determining factor. We were hesitatant about it being in Chinatown, but having never been to NY, we wanted the full experience. We were very pleased with what we found!!! The staff made our trip the best, by suggesting were to eat and making sure we knew were we were going. Our subway experiences were a learning curve, but we were pros after a couple of days. The subway @ the Manhattan Bridge wasn't so loud, and the people in Chinatown were very nice!!! The &quot;F&quot; subway line that you took to get anywhere was a block and a half away, but if you can't walk that, you don't need to go to NY, it is definitely a walking city!!! The Hotel rooms were small but not to small and the beds were very comfortable, it was also clean!!! We stayed a week and didn't want to leave!!! The shopping on Canal St is just blocks away with great bargains, just hit 5th Ave and compare!!! :-) Many thanks to John, Didio, Howard, Hughes, and William at Hotel 91 for a marvelous trip!!! :-)"
16,1934,"Apr 23 2009 	NOISY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT	Although the rooms are clean and the hotel quite well placed, the noise of the trains rattling past every 5 minutes was ridiculous and spoiled what is otherwise a nice hotel. Also, no ok food outlets close by for late night eating.VERY VERY NOISY"
17,1934,"Apr 11 2009 	Nothing special	Stayed there for 1 night in a double full room. I liked reviews here and pictures on the hotel site. But was a bit disappointed by unfriendly staff, our room, which was narrow and had its windows facing the bridge with all its noise. Pillow cases were creased, everything a worn. I won't stay here again."
18,1934,"Mar 23 2009 	Excellent value for money clean decent hotel	My partner and I stayed at Hotel 91 for 1 week in March. The hotel was spotless and the service was excellent. We got clean towels everyday and the room was always very warm and clean. The bathroom was very nice and modern and so was the room, albeit sparse. We had a flat screen tv and a wardrobe, as well as a tiny desk we could just about balance our laptop on. The only thing I would say about the room is that the bed was definitely too small (especially too short) for us! We had booked a Single Full Room, which is supposed to sleep 2, but both my partner's and my feet were hanging off the edge of the bed! (We are 185 and 175cm in height). Our room was on the 7th floor and faced right on to the Manhattan bridge. Sure you could hear the trains pass by, but we never once woke up from the sound. The location is good for evening strolls around Soho and the Lower East Side as you can then easily walk back to the hotel. For daytime, sights etc you just need to catch the Subway... you will never be close to everything you want to see wherever you stay, so it doesn't really make any difference. In short I would say this hotel is perfect if you want to spend your holidays in and around NY city and NOT in your hotel room! We used it just for a night's sleep and we were off again in the morning to explore this fantastic city. It's affordable, decent, warm and clean and you get a good night's sleep - which we REALLY needed every night!"
19,1934,"Mar 21 2009 	amazing modern hotel	Me and my GF stayed at the hotel 91 in chinatown east broadway,and what a treat it was! the hotel was very reasonably priced and the hotel staff were friendly,interesting and very helpful! it situated very close to tribeca and cosmopolitan SoHo,its quite a busy area though neve &quot;noisy&quot; and although the manhattan bridge was very close to our window the hotel has installed a 2 window system where its like double glazing but wider apart so u can hardly hear anything! the bed was the comfiest ive ever slept on! the bathroom was very very clean and they had an ice machine! though no ice buckets! a duane reade shopping bag was all u need to fill to the brim to keep your pop/beers cold,when i go back to new york this will be my hotel of choice!"
20,1934,"Mar 18 2009 	the perfect little hotel in Chinatown	Hotel 91 is the perfect place to be if you arent bothered about being downtown and a good walkin distance way from the main New York attractions (i.e. the Empire State or Times Square). This was my first time in New York and I couldnt fault the hotel at all. On my first day we walked from the hotel all the way up to as far as the Rockefeller Plaza (the border of uptown). Cabs are reasonable to and from wherever you go. We never attempted the subway. The Hotel was just how you want, its like going home from home really, because all hotel staff were so friendly and happy to help, and the room was a comfortable size. When I wanted to use the computer upstairs, it wasnt working and they let me use the one behind the main desk. Although there is no one to man the front door throughout the day, there was alway one man on through the night. It was a safe area and we didnt worry about anyone just walking in to the hotel.The bed was unbelieveably comfortable and the room was cleaned everyday unless you didnt want that and wanted a lie in. Our room was on the 3rd floor was facing the bridge but it didnt bother us at all, its not something we were used to, but the trains just sounded like a really strong wind or a rumble of thunder. They also run less throughout the night. The location is right in Chinatown, you almost feel in a different world, but a short walk away and you have everything you need. Bars and restaurants are within walkin distance if you head up towards Soho or Little Italy.I would definately go back to this hotel again, and now knowing where places are I wouldnt worry about getting lost, although its a pretty easy place to navigate once you get your barings."
21,1934,"Feb 19 2009 	An absolutely wonderful hotel!	Last week I stayed at Hotel 91 for 5 nights with my best friends. We were just us to girls going for a vacation to New York. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. The rooms were very nice and clean every day, when we came back during the late afternoon. We had requested two queen beds - and thats what we got! :) The beds were very comfortable. I had read in here that the noise form the Manhattan Bridge is loud and stuff - but we had a room, where the window faced the bridge and we barely heard the subway. It sounded a bit like a thunder that's still quite far away - you know - like a slight rumbling. Plus at night there are less trains driving, so it's absolutely nothing to complain about (unless you choose to spend a lot of time in your hotel room....).There's no restaurants at the hotel, but instead there's about 3 bakeries next door. During the night there was a nice chinese man sitting just inside the entrance, to make sure, that no dodgy people entered the hotel. The only thing, that was slightly irritating was the smell of fish every day when we went out on the streets - but that's got nothing to do with the hotel..And Canal St. and East Broadway subway stations are very near. In total it's definately a hotel I'd stay at next time I'm visiting NY."
22,1934,"Feb 18 2009 	Valentine's/President's Day In Chinatown	It's not a hotel, hotel, it's more laid back. No doorman, no bellhop, ok by us, just very little work to get settled in. Room was big, Queen Deluxe, (2 beds). The heat took a little patience on our part, bein from NYC we want everything quick, just take your time, it takes a few minutes to kick in, red light will illuminate, rutters will move, very slowly, then we were sweatin once it kicked over. Nice flat screen TV, view out the window of E. B-Way, nothin big, trains on the manhattan bridge, noise did not faze us. Spotless nice size bathroom, all said and done, 275. Balloons for NYC on Presidents Day/Valentines Day weekend, can't beat it. Cabs were hard to find, drinks too, no bars in sight, not after walking either, oh well. We found a nice dim sum house called Golden Unicorn downt he street, 18 E.B-Way i believe, 2nd floor, get there early if ya don;t wanna wait, they open 10AM, 9AM weekends, wild aggressive loud atmosphere/ambience, however, good food. We would def go back to Hotel 91, clean, great price, what more do ya need?"
23,1934,"Feb 3 2009	Good Basic Accomodation	I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel 91. I chose this hotel for two reasons; it was close to where my son lives and the price. I found it to be clean and very basic. The room was small with no view, but hey, I was there just to sleep. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The staff at the front desk were always very helpful and polite. The trains didn't bother me at all - you could hardly hear them. Yes, it is in China Town with all the attendant sights and smells, but that was part of its charm. Yes, the lobby is on the second floor - just follow the signs. Yes, there is only one elevator, but I never had to wait. The East Broadway subway stop is just two blocks away. No bells and whistles, just an honest clean hotel room. Where else in New York can you get two queen sized beds for $118 a night? I would definitely stay there again."
24,1934,"Feb 2 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	I just come back from, staying in New yorks, famous china town.I stayed in Hotel 91, It's a lovely hotel for the price and the star rating, It's the best hotel in china town, The hotel is smack bang in the middle of china town, a very bussy area, all mainly chinese people, with very little english, it's like being in another world, you will find, many great things to do in china town, it's not how people have made it out to be china town is very very big, and you need know where your going or you will get lost, esspecially at night.The food there is great, and the people are friendly.Now for the hotel, it's very very clean, Very spacious, and very private, the reception is easy to find, and the service is more than excellent, They always have hot fresh water for Tea or coffee, They have a lovely warm lounge, which is very relaxing, receptionist's, make you feel more than welcome.Apparently there are two sides to stay in hotel 91, But I got the side where the bridge is, and to be honest the view from the bathroom is nice, but there is no view from the bedrooms on the 6th floor, from 603 upwards, but that doesn't spoil, the fact that the rooms are 100% cosey and lucious.If your on a buget, there is no shame in saying so, because hotel 91 is more than your average 3star hotel, and I would go there again, if I decided to back."
25,1934,"Jan 24 2009	Great hotel for the price!	I would definitely stay at this hotel again. At first, I was concerned about the bridge being so close (my window faced it), but it didn't bother me at all. I was in NYC w/my little brother - who has never been before - and I think he was a little bummed out about the location. So, I would suggest that if you are going for business, or have been before, or prefer the LES, then this is a safe bet. However, if you're looking for something more touristy, then I'd look somewhere else. The hotel itself was nice and new. The room was really small, but who spends a lot of time in the room anyway. There was an ethernet cable for internet access. The beds were comfortable, and the linens were clean."
26,1934,"Dec 16 2008 	Good base to explore	We stayed at Hotel 91 for 7 nights at the end of November/start of December. I knew that the hotel was not in a very central location for tourists, but we really wanted to stay for 7 nights and our budget would not stretch to staying in the midtown area. Some of the taxi drivers were asking us why we were staying here, as they didn't know that there was a hotel in the area.If you're just looking for a clean place to sleep and shower then this hotel is ideal. It's not fancy, but it is clean, the beds are very comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious and there is plenty of hot water. The staff are friendly and helpful and there is a subway station literally 2 blocks away (E Broadway). From here you can take the F train which stops at several of the major mid-town locations most used for sight-seeing.If you are happy to accept the fact that yes, you're going to have to make the effor to ride the subway to get around and that the hotel is only for sleeping, changing and showering, then this an ideal, budget-friendly base to explore the city from. Nearby useful places:- E Broadway Subway Station- Grand St Gourmet Deli- The Rainbow Cafe- Starbucks on Delancey"
27,1934,"Nov 26 2008 	A Good Value Hotel	Overall our stay at Hotel 91 was fine. The hotel was clean and new, and the bed was probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in away from home. The staff were friendly, and check-out was easy. My husband arrived before me and said that there was a problem with the key card when he first went to the room (three trips down to the reception on the second floor before it was correctly programmed), but aside from that there were no problems with check-in either.I had asked for a room away from the side of the hotel that the trains were on, and this request was granted. What we hadn't expected was that the room had no window! There was a skylight, but due to vandalism this had been covered over, and so the room was dark unless the lights were on. This wasn't a major problem for me, as we only wanted to sleep and shower at the hotel, but it was still quite a surprise. We could still hear the trains, so I can't imagine how loud they must have been on the 'train side' of the hotel!My only real problem with the hotel was the shower. We were on the 7th floor, and the water pressure was so low that there was just a trickle of water really. It took about 5 minutes to heat up, so we had to be quite patient.I would still recommend this hotel as it was good value for money, and had nothing majorly wrong with it, but if you are looking for luxury, or are a light sleeper, I would definitely look elsewhere."
28,1934,"Nov 18 2008	Some good some bad	A slightly mixed experience.On the one hand, the room was clean, beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was well sized, and also clean. In my experience these are certainly not guaranteed in hotels!However, the location is adjacent to the Manhattan Bridge, which is excessively noisy at all times. The room was so narrow that there was barely room to walk around the end of the beds. There are smaller niggles too - the internet, though free, is wired, and the wire is so short that you had to use laptops on the bedside table - why not provide a secure wifi? The desk is very small - certainly not large enough to work from. There is no food offering, and the complimentary tea and coffee are low quality.Overall, this is fine as a place to crash, though not a hotel to spend lots of time in."
29,1934,"Nov 12 2008 	Good Value Depending on Room Location	A good value IF you get a room on the side that is not adjacent to the elevated train tracks; trains rumble through every five minutes until midnight or longer. Clean, pleasant staff, on edge of Chinatown and near Little Italy and not far from SoHo."
30,1934,"Oct 22 2008 	Good value for money neighborhood not so	Booked the hotel because it offered a good price for a NY hotel, the room was clean, bed - the best we've ever slept on, air conditioning , cable TV, LAN internet connection (which I could not configure with my laptop) but basic - small wardroad, no safe, minibar or even a luggage stand. The staff was terrific, very helpful &amp; even let me use their computer to check my gmail. Also reccomended a great Chinese restaurant.There is a freight elevator which can take your bags to the reception on the second floor otherwise it is a longish walk along the still empty ground floor &amp; down a few steps.Though trains pass the Brooklyn Bridge all the time, noise was not an issue as the double glazing was very efficient.The hotel is in Chinatown &amp; the chinese not the touristy part of Chinatown, almost all the shops &amp; signs are in Chinese catering to the locals many of them do not speak English or do not bother to answer, at night everything is closed with black nylon bags of garbage dotting the pavement. The neighborhood is safe but not pleasant. Subway is a 6-8 minutes from the hotel and the F line runs along 6th Av."
31,1934,"Oct 18 2008 	Nice Hotel	My friend &amp; I stayed at Hotel 91 in Chinatown for 1 night ~ Saturday, 9/27/08. I read the reviews here religiously to make sure I chose wisely &amp; was prepared for everything. We chose this hotel b/c it is literally 1 block from where our bus drops off/picks up. So, for our purposes the location couldn't have been better. We arrived in NYC at an unexpected 6am! The bus driver had a lead foot. Happily, our room was available &amp; we went right up. It was eery that the entire first floor was vacant, nothing but empty tiny shops with glass windows. It was a pain in the @$$ that check-in/out was on the second floor - just added 1 more thing you had to do when coming in creating an unecessary ripple in what would ordinarily be a smooth arrival. The staff were incredibly friendly (&amp; gorgeous) throughout our entire stay, including my phone calls to confirm our reservation, as well as another reservation I made for October which I had to switch around, then ultimately cancel. Our room was nice - the walls were bare - something I'm not used to seeing, but I guess I prefer nothing as opposed to tacky, cheap art on the walls. The Manhattan Bridge was right outside our window &amp; we naturally heard the trains, but it wasn't enough to be a bother. The bathroom was beautiful, but while unpacking my travel case I saw some dried-on brown gunk near the faucet, which I was able to remove w/ my fingernail. Now for the shower...while my friend was taking a shower I heard this loud Clang!!, followed by her laughing - thank god. She burst out in a towel &amp; asked me, &quot;Did you hear that?!&quot; The handle that controlled the water flow/temperature had fallen off &amp; into the tub. This made adjusting the water temperature a nightmare. We could shove the handle back on &amp; adjust the temperature slowly, but it took forever. The A/C worked great, but that D@*%^D remote gadget was ridiculous. It looked like something you could use to fly a spaceship with. Why the need to be so complicated? It sucked that we were only provided with 1 tall cabinet to store our clothing. This closet only had 3 hangers &amp; a small shelf at the bottom. My friend ended up keeping everything in her suitcase - just not enough room to accomodate clothing/shoes for 2 people!!! The beds were like a dream - probably the 2nd best hotel bed I have ever slept in. The linens were pristine &amp; the beds came w/ 4 pillows!! That was a fantastic bonus. I'm used to just 2 crappy pillows - I lay there wishing I had 2 more....this hotel made my wish come true!! Very clean &amp; superbly comfortable. Overall our stay was very nice. However, when I returned home I realized I had left my camera's battery charger plugged into an outlet in the hotel room - I even have a picture to prove it - take a look &amp; see! I made numerous phone calls to the hotel regarding this &amp; while they were very nice &amp; promised to leave a note &amp; call to let me know either way, etc. etc. It resulted in nothing - not even the phone call they promised to let me know whether or not they found it. I've since replaced it, but that lack of effeciency &amp; customer service is troubling. Overall we enjoyed our stay &amp; would go back - the price was decent for what we got ~ $199. And, if anyone stays in room 403 &amp; sees my battery charger in the outlet by the television - tell the front desk asap!! :)"
32,1934,"Sep 28 2008 	An ok no frills stay.	This was the second hotel we stayed at during our ten day long visit to New York.We picked this hotel for three primary reasons. 1. It is located in Manhattan 2. For it's location, the price we paid was a bargain, with many other Manhattan hotels charging roughly 50% more than what we was paying3.The hotel was less than a month old, and we wanted a clean room.Overall, I would say our stay was ok.Location wise, we got lost a few times trying to find the hotel as Chinatown is so chaotic and it's easy to lose your way. Getting to Midtown Manhattan (where we spent a lot of our time) proved to be more difficult than when we stayed in Long Island City where the no.7 train took us to Times Sq in less than 15 mins.So before you book, do find out where you will be spending most of your time.This hotel is good for Chinatown, Statue of Liberty, Battery park, Wall Street and of course SoHo.The hotel was clean and so were the towels.But the rooms were very small, and with basic ameneties.One criticism is the doors have very big gaps, and the windows have poor insulation which means it can be very noisy with the hotel being beside the Subway track.All in all, for what we paid, I feel we did get value for money, but Iit appears that prices have risen to $300+ per night, and this seems a tad high to me for a very basic room, which does not even have an in-room mini bar ,a safe or even a luggage stand.On the upside, there was free internet access, free coffee/tea making facility in the lobby area and the staff were very friendly and helpful.I would stay at this hotel again, but only if this was the cheapest Manhattan hotel available to me at the time."
33,1934,"Sep 23 2008 	I love Hotel 91 in Chinatown	Great place right in the heart of Chinatown. Rooms were clean, spacious for NYC. The a/c remote was a little confusing, but once we figured it out it was fine. There no coffeemakers in the room, but there is an area on the second floor for free coffee (instant) and tea. The water dispenser was a little funky to operate, but again, once you figure it out it was was fine. The staff was TOTALLY friendly and so SO very helpful. Look forward to staying there again. This is a minimalist kind of place so if you want lots of frills, go somewhere else. I REALLY enjoyed my stay at Hotel 91 :))"
34,1934,"Sep 4 2008 	Welcome to Chinatown!	Hotel 91 is a great bargain the heart of Manhattan's Chinatown. I stayed for 2 weekday nights with friends. I found it purely by chance. I frequently take the chinatown express bus from Washington, DC to Manhattan's chinatown and walked by the hotel on my way from the bus stop to the subway. My friends and I got the room at $219.00 per night, which I thought was a great deal considering the last 2 weeks of August are the height of the summer tourist season. I actually had to work in Flushing, so I asked the concierge about how to get there. He told me that I could take the chinese shuttle to Flushing for $2.50, it departs from Confucius Plaza when the bus is full. Shweet!We had a room on the other side of the hotel so we did not hear the trains at night. The room was small, we had 2 queen beds, but all you really need is a clean bed and shower and we were very satisfied with that. The beds and bathrooms were comparable to an upscale 3 star hotel. I loved the modern decor combined with Asian accents.Service was excellent, the people at the front desk were very helpful. While there were no ironing boards and irons in the room, when I asked to borrow them, the gal brought them to my room within the hour.In the morning you can walk to any of the bakeries and get a pastry and coffee for less than $2.00. I also got Bubble tea in the afternoons.One morning, I walked a few blocks and hopped on the F train at the corner and took it to Koreatown at 32nd and Broadway, very quick ride and only costs $2.00 one way.The hotel is still new and the ground floor glass retail shops are still vacant. It's sort of odd to walk by the empty rooms on the way to the elevator. I wonder about security. I see the black half dome security cameras in the ceilings but you don't need your hotel room key to go access the elevator at all. So that means that anyone walking off the street can get in the elevator and walk the halls of the hotel on any floor. I never had a problem during my stay regarding security, but I do wonder about it.We also walked around, there is so much to see and do, the Buddhist temples, all the shops and restaurants, Little Italy, men playing chinese checkers in Columbus Park, people doing Tai Chi outdoors in the mornings, etc. I loved it. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and the location."
35,1934,"Aug 24 2008 	Great place to stay	What a great find! I needed a place to stay on the Lower East Side for a class I was taking. After reading various reviews, I decided to take a chance on Hotel 91. My roommate and I had a wonderful experience. The hotel was clean, sparkling bathrooms, crisp white comforters and very plush beds. Having stayed at hotels in NYC, including The Plaza, I was hesitant, but I needn't have been. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the noise was nothing like some of the reviews said. Yes, the hotel is near the Manhattan Bridge, but the windows are double pane with an air layer in between. Any sounds we heard were much quieter than most hotel air-conditioners. And the air-conditioner in the room here was extremely quiet and worked well. We requested a room that overlooked the street and also one that was large since we were going to be there for five nights. We got a handicapped accessible room that was quite ample for the two of us - 2 queen size beds. The outer hallway was huge; there was even another bathroom directly across from our room. The decor is spartan; nothing on the walls, an armoire for a closet, no ironing board or iron, but there was a flat HDTV and it worked for us. It doesn't have amenities like a restaurant or swimming pool but for our needs, it was just fine. We even got a discount because we stayed there for more than 4 nights. The flavor of Chinatown was really an added plus. We could walk to Little Italy and experience all the sights and sounds of the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again."
36,1934,"Aug 12 2008 	Weird decor good value helpful staff	The hotel is in a weird part of town, not particularly central to any part of the city but a great cultural experience in one of New York's oldest neighborhoods nonetheless.The decor is a bit drab, when you first walk in you see a bunch of glass stalls, which upon further investigation are supposed to be stores. (How you're supposed to have a store in a 5 foot by 10 foot space I have no idea) The 2nd floor is where the front desk is, which was fine, the staff was pretty efficient and very warm and personable, unlike a lot of Manhattan hotels. They were helpful throughout the entire stay. The lounge area on the second floor is terribly decorated. It looks like someone took all of their grandmother's junk from the last 40 years and threw it in one room. There is a flatscreen tv, but it's surrounded by 3 junky old leather couches (the hotel is supposedly new, would it have been too much to spend $2000 to put 3 new couches in? After all, it's the first thing people see when they walk in.). Then there is a big white porcelain elephant and what looks like an urn just sitting on the floor next to the couch. Doesn't go with the couches, the TV or the rickety old chinese furniture in the room. The carpet in the lobby areas throughout the hotel is just horrid looking, it makes you dizzy just walking on it, it looks kind of like the carpet from &quot;The Shining&quot;.The rooms themselves have just about everything you really need for a hotel stay: TV, internet, comfortable bed, private bathroom. The decor is pretty shabby, cheap vinyl chairs and furniture that looks like it was made by a boy scout at camp. Cheap plastic covered wood. The bathroom marble counter doesn't match the tiles on the floor or the wall. Looks like someone went to a lot of hardware clearance sales.For its price, the hotel is actually a good value and I'm being overly picky about the decorator's terribly bad taste. But whichever interior decorator did the hotel should definitely reconsider their career.The only real gripes I have are:A. Cleanliness - A lot of other reviewers have said this hotel is clean. I would agree, at first glance. But a closer look would reveal a lot of corner cutting. The middle of the room gets vacuumed but there is dirt at the edges. The windows never get cleaned and are outright filthy. Stains and smudges on the walls. Garbage in the hallways, stairwells and elevators. It's obvious that their housekeepers are understaffed and overworked, so it's understandable they can't get to everything. But it doesn't excuse the fact that things aren't clean.B. Someone else had mentioned a nosy owner during their stay, and I would agree. During my check in, a similar old lady came out of the elevator, walked around the line (3-4 people waiting to check in at this point) to the side of the counter and started demanding things from the kid working the counter (who was obviously already speaking with a customer). &quot;Print this, is so and so here, I need this and that.&quot; in a very loud and obnoxious manner. Very unprofessional in a hotel environment and obviously could have waited until after guests had finished. After she had gotten her list of demands, the kid said &quot;Sorry for the inconvenience, but that was the owner&quot;.The next day, the owner happened to be on the elevator when I got on and tried to make small talk. It turned into a grilling about what I was doing on my trip to New York and then an endless list of things I SHOULD do according to her. If I needed the advice I would have asked.Obviously this is the owner's first hotel and she has no experience whatsoever with hospitality. She would be well advised to take after her employees a bit, who actually made an otherwise very average stay pretty pleasant. For the price, the hotel is a good place to stay. Just avoid the owner and pretend you're colorblind when you look at the decor."
37,1934,"Jul 31 2008	Very Clean Hotel	Never had been to New York before but kinda of a last minute thing. Hotels are very expensive, so found this one on line. In comparsion to price and other reviews we choose this one. I was very satisfied. Although a little strange that you check in on the 2nd floor, the hotel was very clean and very comfortable beds. Yes, the train was right outside our room, was noisey but didn't bother us at all. Since it's right in China Town be prepared to walk a few blocks if you don't want Chinese Food. Yes, when you are out in the streets there are vendors selling fish, fruit and other things and it was kind of smelly but it's just as you pass the vendor. There are bakeries close and Chinese Restaurants all over the place.The hotel staff at the desk was nice and helpful as they could be. They are no vending machines, just an ice machine. We rode the subway to get around, which at first is a little confusing but the staff gave us a map and some help.Yes, it isn't real close to the tourist area's, you have to take a bus or the subways.So it does require a lot of walking. Little Italy is a couple of blocks away and is nice, especially if you like Italian food."
38,1934,"Jul 29 2008 	Average stay great staff with some problems	When i first arrived at Hotel 91, the first floor was full of empty store fronts that made me think the person that built the hotel didn't plan very well. During check-in, everything went pretty well, staff was very friendly and helpful until an old chinese woman rudely walked right in front of me while I was checking in. She asked the front desk clerkif they needed any change, so I figured it was either a manager or the owner. After she left, and I was able to finally finish my check in, I asked the front desk clerk about who the woman was and she confirmed that it was the owner. This wouldn't have been that abnormal at a business except for the fact that 1.)She cut in front of me and interrupted me as I was speaking 2.)The owner was dressed as though they were going fishing and not working at a hotel. This happened again when I was downstairs getting directions from the staff. The owner still in her fishing clothes, interrupted the conversation out of no where and tried to help but all she did was talk for 10 minutes straight giving directions that I couldn't even understand When I got up to the sixth floor to go to my room, there was an old piece of furniture that looks kinda like a tombstone that fell apart. Also the lobby looks like they went to a garage sale and just bought everything and threw it in one room. As far as the actual hotel is concerned, the rooms were fair size for new york, and the staff was excellent. If not for a nosy owner and shabby decor, the place was a great find."
39,1934,"Jul 21 2008 	The hotel is great it's the neighbourhood that stinks (literally).	The good: The hotel is relatively new so it's very clean with modern styled rooms. It's also very comfortable. The beds and pillows were excellent, as was the state-of-the-art AC/heating unit in the room (so long as you don't let your friend turn the AC off in the middle of the night causing you to wake up in a pool of your own sweat). My friend and I stayed on the fifth floor and we couldn't hear a peep from the street or bridge. Also the price was great compared to places closer to Times Square that looked fairly run down. I should also mention that the staff at the front desk (oddly located on the second floor) was very friendly and helpful. The distance from the nearest subway station is only a few blocks...just far enough for you to escape the crowds and the smell...The bad:Here we go. Chinatown is disgusting. The smell from the street vendors and grocers was horrible, like rotting fishy garbage that flows along the gutters. Now this is not something the hotel really has any control over but it's just unfortunate. As I mentioned above, luckily the smell and crowds of people only surround the hotel for a few blocks so if you can hold your breath while squeezing through a crowded sidewalk then you should be okay. Other things worth noting are that the water pressure in the shower on the fifth floor was really weak and the hotel only has one ice machine on the fourth floor. This bit is weird, when someone is taking a shower you usually can't hear it over by the beds but when the person in the room next door takes a shower you can hear it quite loudly. If you care about this sort of thing, the television in the room doesn't provide any sort of movie or video game services. There really isn't much to do in the neighbourhood (unless your favourite game is Guess That Smell*) so if you want a place within walking distance of any fun then forget it. You will need to call a cab or take the subway for sure.(*The answer is always: Rotting fish guts.)"
40,1934,"Jul 20 2008 	Recoomended For: Value (by NYC standards!) Cleanliness Comfort	This hotel had recently opened only a few months earlier as of my stay in July 2008. As a result, everything in the room was new, clean, and comfortable. The room itself was basic, but functional. I did not miss features you might expect in a more expensive place such as a sofa, fridge, of microwave. A room safe would have been nice to store a passport, however I understand a safe is available for storage at the front desk. Other reviews have complained about subway noise from the Manhattan Bridge. Our room was equipped with two sets of double-glazed windows, and street noise was not an issue.The hotel is closest (two stoplights) to the East Broadway subway station, and is very convenient to arrive at any destination in Manhattan or the surrounding boroughs. Be warned that while the hotel is extremely clean, it is located in the heart of Chinatown. At street level, the neighbourhood is safe, but definitely crowded, gritty, and smelled of food waste from the many restaurants and grocers.All in all, I would recommend this hotel on the following strengths: Price (by NYC standards), Cleanliness, Comfort, and Central Location. Given the basic amenities of the rooms and the unpleasant conditions on the streets outside, I would not recommend it for travellers who want their hotel to be a destination in and of itself."
41,1934,"Jul 12 2008 	What an awesome find!	This was a true gem of a find! We got a great deal for 5 nights on Expedia.com. This hotel is located in the heart of Chinatown, which for the traveler looking for a luxurious stay will find a disappointment. However, if you're looking for a TRUE stay in one of the greatest cities in the US, then Hotel 91 could not be a better fit. One step out the front door and you are in the dead center of the Chinatown Marketplace. The fishy odor that many guests mentioned was not nearly as bad as commented. Rooms: Were incredibly spacious by NYC standards. Huge bathrooms. The rooms were very clean, everything looked new and in excellent condition. I should also note that there was an additional bathroom on each floor with a toilet, sink, and large mirror that was helpful with multiple guests getting ready in the mornings. Cleaning staff came each morning, were very friendly and efficient. Staff: As noted, cleaning staff was great. The front desk staff was also helpful and friendly, and were quick to give great recommendations as to where to eat in Chinatown. They held our luggage between check-out time and the time we left to fly out of NYC, which was very helpful. Location: As said before, this hotel is right in the center of Chinatown. It's such a culturally diverse spot, really a highlight of this area and this hotel. It is a very short walk to the subway. Many users noted that the train was very close by and this was an annoyance to them. The train was right outside our window and was not at all annoying, distracting, nor did it ever wake me up on any of the 5 nights of my stay. I hardly even noticed the noise, besides, who comes to NY to hang out in their hotel room?Overall I rate this hotel a 4-4.5. It was a great deal, excellent location, extremely clean, and I will most definitely be coming back in the future. All my friends that joined me on the trip were equally as thrilled as I was to find this great place."
42,1934,"Jun 29 2008 	A gem in Chinatown	We stayed one night at the Hotel 91 during a stopover in New York City. We deliberately chose to be in Chinatown as we wanted an authentic Chinese dinner in the evning. Check-in was efficient and friendly being met on the ground floor by a porter, the check-in in on the 2nd floor. Within minutes we were in our room, the hotel is less than 3 months old so it was in a super condition. Flat screen TV, airco and a decent size modern bathroon/ shower with hairdryer. We knew in advance that the hotel is close to the Manhattan Bridge and you do hear the train at night, a sort of low thudding sound, although it didn't keep is awake. The beds were two queen sized, clean and comfortable although to get to the 2nd bed you do need to shuffle past the 1st one, there's not much room. After dumping our baggage in the room and freshening up we asked the young helpful staff where the best places to eat were, one of them recommended to us was &quot;The NY Noodle Shop&quot; a lively Chinese restuarant in Bowery street a couple of blocks away, If you don't fancy Chinese 5 minutes further takes you to little Italy. One thing you should know is that this is real Chinatown with all the sights and smells that entails. We loved it but know this maybe not to everybody's liking, my wife even had her hair done by a Chinese hairdressers 3 doors away !! When we checked out in the morning the hotel was kind enough to allow us to leave our bags with them until our transportation to the airport arrived, we also could wait in the lounge which has complimentary tea and coffee available. All in all this a good hotel, reasonably priced but you have to know about it's location, we'd be back for sure."
43,1934,"Jun 25 2008 	New and nice hotel	We stayd in Hotel 91 for 4 nights after staying midtown Grand Hyatt for 3 nights. I liked both hotels and I am happy that I had an opportunity to stay in two such different neighbourhoods. Next time I will propably stay somewhere in downtown. Midtown will be option only if I get a great deal in 4 star hotel.Hotel 91 is conveniently located if you want have a dinner in Little Italy or drinks in the East Village. It is near to two subway stops and a short taxi drive to lot of interesting areas. We took a bus to Union square and subway to Brooklyn and walked across the Brooklyn Bridge. Taxi is difficult to get from this hotel but you can ask the staff call you a car. We ordered a car in advance to the airport and the price was 45 $ and it was told us in advance. The surroundings was exactly as described in other reviews: fishmarkets and a huge crowds except in the evening. We enjoyed it and I would definitely stay here again. We liked the hotel and the neighborhood, There isn't good coffee shops near by, we did not mind: we got our cappuccinos and espressos in Little Italy. You get instant coffee and tea from the hotel and something to eat from the 3 bakeries next door and you will get great lunch in chinatown. We had a double queen room for two and it was spacious for our needs. Room was new and matresses were good. New linen was nice although it wasn't changed during our 4 night stay. Everything was clean. Bathroom was chic and towels were changed every day. Bathroom was larger than we had in Grand Hyatt. With current prices I was satisfied what I got."
44,1934,"Jun 23 2008 	Loved Hotel 91 in Chinatown	Hotel 91 is a great place to stay in NYC. It's in the heart of Chinatown, convenient for getting to any of the city's neighborhoods, especially Soho and the Village. Staff is fantastic, friendly, and helpful. Bed was big and clean. Flat screen TV in the room and a big hanging closet. Clean shower and bathroom, amenities, etc. Unbeatable value in a place where hotels are outrageously overpriced. I would definitely go back here any time I come to NYC."
45,1934,"Jun 7 2008	Very Nice but Location is Everything	I m checking out of Hotel 91 today. We had a double twin for 4 nights. I am on the traiin side. Noise did not bother me since I can hear the trains at night at home as well. What bothered me is the smell walking in and out of hotel from all the Supermarkets. This was of the fish, garbage etc. I would not step in any of these because they all look incredibly filthy. And we did see a nasty rat runny wild in the street. And saw another running in the train staion where the cars would run. Thats 2 more then I have seen in my past 3 other trips.2 blocks from the F train. This mean at least 30 minutes to any attraction. 20 miute walk to the shopping district in Chinatown. 4th time in NYC in two years first time stayed outside of Midtown. No Starbucks for a good 15 minute walk. Could not figure out what restaurants to eat in because all the signs are in Chinese. Tried one, Mings Cafe right befind the F train stop. Yummy fried noodles. I don't think I saw one place to buy a six pack or bottle of wine. Sidewalks roll up here around 9:00pm while Midtown is happening.Room was cleaned well except, sheets were not changed. On the last day, no toiletries were given. Common areas very clean. One ice machine was not enought for all floors. There were no vending machines of any kind.Hotel staff helpfu and very nice. The night clerk was kind enough to help me figure out the thermostat which was a little tricky.I would not stay here again because because of proximity to Midtown. The walls were way too thin but hey, its just a little noise.Value is wonderful. I paid$155 a night."
46,1934,"May 27 2008 	Value for money but don't expect too much	The hotel is relatively new, and as such hasn't gotten everything down yet (like housekeeping comes as late as 7pm some days), but value for money was there. The subway is 2 blocks away, Little Italy is a few blocks away. The hotel has hot water and instant coffee/tea bags in the lobby, but the closest good cup of coffee is over 1/2 mile away. The neighborhood is full of fish markets so smells terrible. The beds were comfortable, the rooms clean and the staff friendly. We got a special rate for an extended stay, so if you are planning to stay a few nights, call the hotel for a price quote."
47,1934,"May 26 2008 	Chinatown convenience	At the time of our stay, this budget hotel, according to the staff, had only been open for a few weeks. The standard of the hotel is modest but good. Because the property is new, everything is clean and works properly. The rooms are, as most in NYC, small, but they are clean, equipped with a comfortable bed, a brightly lit private bathroom, hairdryer included, are individually airconditioned with remote control, and offer clock radio, telephone, and LCD televisions with a modest channel line-up. The true drawback of this hotel is its extreme proximity to the Manhattan Bridge. Anyone who has seen the Blues Brothers movie will recall Elwood's (Dan Aykroyd) response to Jake's (John Belushi) question regarding the frequency of the trains traveling past Elwood's room: &quot;So often you won't even notice them.&quot; Someone who is looking for silence should therefore look elsewhere. It should however be noted that the trains run less often at night. Also, while not &quot;paper thin,&quot; the walls of the room could have been made somewhat thicker to better isolate noise from adjacent rooms and hallway.The staff is courteous and speak English natively or at least very well. A request for left behind razor and shaving cream was promptly complied with. Leaving bags at the hotel, prior to check-in, as well as after check-out, was accommoted with ease. In all, our stay was a satisfying one. For those familiar with Chinatown bus travel, they will appreciate the hotel's proximity to the drop off zone on East Broadway. Hotel 91, refererencing its location on said street, is merely a block away. Let's hope the hotel will retain its current value and quality and we will surely return."
48,1934,"May 23 2008 	Find someplace else unless you have to be right in Chinatown	The first review of this brand new property was helpful and accurate; ask for a room on the opposite side of the bridge, small rooms, etc. I took their advice. But on balance, the review may have been too friendly. Better than ask for all the concessions, etc.; simply don't stay here.I'm not all that picky about hotels, even though I've flown a million miles (really) and stayed in hundreds and hundreds of hotels. I want a hotel that is clean, quiet, convenient, has a decent bed and pillows, has a good iron and board, and has a shower that works properly. Your basic Hampton Inn or Marriott Courtyard is absolutely fine with me. I'm not a snob.This hotel, in the funky heart of Chinatown, simply isn't ready, and won't likely ever be. It appears to be still under some construction, but they did get a screaming deal on tile. A long, hollow hallway leading to the elevator is still largely empty. Chinatown is exotic and interesting, of course. But it's also smelly, filthy and crowded, making it difficult to even get down the street. The hotel doesn't offer a warm, welcome respite from that.I stayed in a room on the opposite side of the hotel from the subway, yes. But it had no windows, was relatively small, and was still a bit loud. New bed and bedding, a new armoire and desk (as if bought at Walmart), and a new bathroom. The shower, being that it was on the 7th floor, I guess, was more a &quot;dribble&quot; than a &quot;shower.&quot; Water barely came out. Ridiculous.Clean, yes. But no amenities. One example: there was no iron or ironing board in the room, so I called down to get one. That took about 30 minutes and a second call. But worse was the fact that the relatively new ironing board smelled terrible!! Like molding trash! And made my shirt smell awful, rendering it unusable. (They're obviously storing the board in the same closet as the trash, or in the alley, or something. Terrible.)A single elevator means that you're also going to wait a while sometimes.Another problem: it was very difficult to get a taxi from this location, and the subway line is not all that convenient.Needless to say, I won't ever be staying at this hotel again and recommend that you find another property as well - unless you're really interested in being right in Chinatown."
49,1934,"May 14 2008 	Great value - but some drawbacks	Hotel 91 offers an excellent value in lower Manhattan, with a few drawbacks. Here are some notes of our experience:Pros: - Reasonable price - with prices around the same as they were for a mid-town hostel, this 3-star hotel was a bargain.- Newness - we could still smell the paint drying in the hallways. Bed, curtains, room finishes, etc...are all brand new.- Cleanliness - the lobby, hallways, elevator and room were all spotlessly clean. No sign of any dirt, insects or anything like that. The hotel was new and clean.Cons:- Room size - our &quot;single full&quot; (ie one double bed) room was very compact. There was a tall wardrobe, one bed, one side table and a flat-screen tv in the room and that is all that could fit in it. Clothes had to stay in the bags on the floor, and the room was very full. My guestimate is that the room was 10'x8' plus the bathroom, at most.- Noise - if you googlemap the hotel's location, you will see that it is right beside (ie right underneath) the Manhattan Bridge. Subway trains run through the bridge all day and night. From our room, we were basically looking directly at the subway trains running about 20 feet away. The trains were very loud. We are city people and used to quite a bit of noise, so we could live with it, but others might find it very hard to sleep with the noise. The other side of the hotel is probably better.Pro or con, depending how you look at it:Location - this hotel is located in the middle of Chinatown, with all the sights, sounds and smells that go along with that. Immediately outside the door the sidewalks are full in every direction with crowded stalls selling all manner of things from cheap sunglasses to live crabs. We love it, but your mileage may vary. Overall, this is a good new hotel. We would stay here again, as long as the prices don't go up too much. We would definitely try to get at least a queen size room, and definitely on the east side of the building. The staff was fine, not impressing us much one way or the other. The room amenities were indeed of a 3-star calibre - nice furniture, marble in the bath, new fixtures, etc... If you can live with the drawbacks, it is definitely worth a visit."

1,1935,A pleasant Thanksgiving surprise!	I stayed at this hotel during the Thanksgiving holiday and was not only very surprised but very pleased! All hotel accomodations were great. My room had a very comfortable king bed &amp; I slept like a baby! Continental breakfast was great! Hotel bar was great! I'll be staying at this hotel again! Location! ws fabulous!
2,1935,"Nice Budget Hotel	We were in town for the Macy's Parade and selected this hotel based on the fact that it was the best deal we could find. That should be your selection criteria too. If you are looking for a clean, simple room, this is it. My husband and I have have stayed in every hotel price range imaginable, but for this trip, we were trying to stay on the cheap, as we knew we would never be in the room. The room was clean and small. All NYC hotels are small, so brace yourself. Beds were comfy and bathrooms clean. Lobby area was nice and they provide a complimentary breakfast of coffee, juice, bagels, and do-nuts. The location is great for exploring and the subway is around the corner and down one block. My only complaint is that our AC banged and roared all night (EVEN WHEN OFF, yes, I know, but it's true). I did let the front desk know, and while he was polite, nothing was fixed. Other than the strange window unti banging, we never heard our neighbors or the street. The staff was polite, but older and not exactly &quot;hip&quot; on cool places to eat or have a drink. You are on your own for that advice. I would probably not stay here again, only because I am personally not a fan of the neighborhood or being that close to Times Square, but for many visitors, the location is perfect."
3,1935,"Great value	I travel to NY often for business and have stayed at many a nice hotel (The Palace, The Plaza, etc), so I was a bit worried about this one. I was traveling with my mother, who did not want to spend a lot, so after reviewing choices on TripAdvisor, we picked The Hotel at Times Square. I must admit it is a good choice for value-minded travelers. It is on a relatively quiet block of 46th between 5th and 6th avenues -- close to 5th Avenue shopping to the east and theaters to the west. I would caution guests to avoid rooms on the east side of the hotel for the next several months, however, as there is a big construction project starting on the lot next door. Our room faced 46th and street noise was minimal (for NY). We heard nothing through the walls either.The rooms are small but that is normal for NY. The room was very clean and the bathroom newly remodeled with plenty of shelf space and nice enough towels. No problems with hot water. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were soft, albeit rather thin. The blanket and bedspread were OK for now, but this will likely be an area to watch as the newness of the redesign starts to fade.The room was always warm, often hot in fact, but we slept with the AC on low and this made the temp perfect as well as blocked street noise.The breakfast room is downstairs and I'm not sure that there is an elevator for the lower level. There is no doorman, so no help with luggage or getting a taxi. The lobby is nice and there was a computer for guest use.My only complaints are that the vending machine didn't work and there are no newspapers available for purchase in the hotel"
4,1935,"Nov 26 2009 	Great hotel in a great location at a great price	Just got back from a quick trip to NYC to see the Macy's parade. The Hotel at Times Square was clean, quiet, nicely furnished, and so convenient to Grand Central and many sites. We stayed in the family suite on the 12th floor and it was spacious, clean, and quiet. We booked through AAA and the price was right. We would definitely stay there again without hesitation."
5,1935,"Nov 23 2009 	Great Hotel Great Value!	Location can't be beat, walking distance to Times Square/theatre district. The hotel was clean and room was nicely furnished. Staff at front desk are professional and accommodating (Geovanna is especially informative and friendly). Definitely will stay there again! A moderately priced hotel in the middle of Times Square!"
6,1935,"Nov 18 2009 	Great Hotel in good location	Stayed in The Hotel at Times Square fo 8 nights with my wife, we found it to be excellent value for money, room was large and with huge bed. There was some traffic noise from street at night but this New York, room was on 7th floor and overlooked a small memorial garden. The Hotel has been renovated recently and certainly looks clean and modern, Breakfast was included and this consisted of cereals, bagels and bread to toast with fruit and yoghurt a fine start to day. The area around Hotel has loads of Restauants and Bars and is only 200yards from center of Times Square.Would recomend this Hotel and would Stay again."
7,1935,"Nov 17 2009 	excellent location moderate price best for family trips	Stayed for 6 nights in this Hotel on our (re-)discovery trip to NYC. Appreciated the location, the service, the business centre, friendliness of the staff. All this for a moderate price, so you can .... spend your dollars elsewhere. Best proof : a full house!Recommend it for tourism and private/family trips."
8,1935,"Nov 17 2009 	good value wonderful location	Very good hotel,good price, close to all nyc atractions,new room, refurnished, very confortable."
9,1935,"Nov 15 2009 	No frills but perfect location	We stayed here for 10 days while holidaying for 4 weeks around the US. We stayed here last when it was the super 8. There have been a few upgrades since then and the price is still around the same. I think it may be due to the construction next door. The noise from this starts at 7am every week day so be prepared to wake up early! Other than the noise which will finish one day the hotel is great. It is in a great location and although the rooms are small they have everything you need. We weren't there to sit in our room so it was more than adequate and the bed was quite comfy. I found the free wi-fi a bit patchy but we were on the top floor so this may have had something to do with it. The breakfast room has been extended since our last stay and there was plenty of room for everyone to sit and eat.You can't beat this place for its location, between 5th and 6th Ave and so close to Times Square and a short walk to Central Park. It was a great base for us to explore the city from."
10,1935,"Nov 15 2009 	great location and price shame the reception desk staff were surly	This hotel was recommended to us by friends and is in a great location, easy walking distance to Times Square and the upper east side. The continental breakfast was fine and the man working in the breakfast room was very pleasant and helpful. We booked a king size room and it was large (not small at all). Be careful if booking via their website - there is a system glitch that books 2 rooms when you book a room. When we arrived at the hotel the front desk man was quite rude about it and made us feel very uncomfortable and that we were at fault. We know that this also happened to at least one other couple while we were there - so it appears that it is their website. If they don't fix their website I recommend that you confirm your booking prior to arrival rather than suffer the grief when you check in."
11,1935,"Nov 10 2009 	Location for a Deal	Not right on Times Square but very close. Between 6th and 5th Avenue (Times Square is where Broadway crosses 7th Avenue). I was in Nw York for three days to see four plays. Three of the theaters were only an easy 15 minute walk from the hotel. The fourth was a 20 block walk up Broadway to Lincoln Center. This is the first time I was ever in New York without using the subway.The real surprise was the quality of the hotel for the price. I paid $189 a night, which included AARP discount and all the taxes ($27.40). All of the pictures on their web site are accurate. I had a single room which was large with plenty of closet and drawer space and a desk and two chairs. I was on the 9th floor and could even look out half of my window and see the street below and the sky above. Wallpaper and drapes looked new. Bathroom was large and bright and new-looking"
12,1935,"Nov 10 2009 	Although room was small met all our needs and can't beat location for the price.	Didn't know what to expect. Couldn't believe my eyes when I realized that we were only 1 block away from Times Square. Although hotel is not fancy, it met all our needs. It was clean and beds were comfortable. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Even the breakfast was adequate to get our day started. Can't beat the price for where the hotel is located. I was there with my 2 adult daughters and never feared walking alone at night. My daughters are planning to go back with their families around Christmas. Was even able to print my boarding passes in the business centre. Usually there is no paper available for printing."
13,1935,"Nov 7 2009 	Average	WHAT HEAT IN THE ROOMS!!!!!!! Staying here for a week we were hoping for a good, quiet, relaxing, friendly and inexpensive accomodation. We got all, but the heating was so overpowering. We asked for heating to be turned down, told it was, the room still made us sick. We also had to change rooms as the family rooms are so small, we paid for upgrading to a suite, a little better, heating still a disaster.Continental breakfast very good, crossiants, juice,cereals, fruit, tea coffee as much as you like. Reception personal very helpful, housekeeping staff very polite. Overall good hotel, great location. THE BAR UPSTAIRS SO OVERPRIZED GO ELSEWHERE FOR A JAR, BETTER VALUE."
14,1935,"Nov 4 2009 	Horrible: No refund even after explaining my son was discovered a terminal disease	Not 24 hours before, as their policy states, but 20 hours before, we called to cancel a reservation, because our child had been diagnosed a terminal disease just hours before, on that same Friday. We had a reservation for Saturday.This was the answer from the manager, when I requested a refund, with a doctor's letter:-------------Dear Mr. ,I am very sorry for the delay on the request below but we can not creditthe no-show charges because our room was left vacant &amp; clean as we hadheld the room in good faith.Sorry again-------------I will not only never go there, but make every effort possible to damage their image, because they don't deserve to be in business. I'm a frequent traveller and have cancelled reservations before, with less important excuses, and never had a response like this. If you want to give these kind of people a job, know what business you're throwing your money into."
15,1935,"Oct 30 2009 	Top hotel for tourists.	We stayed here at the start and end of our trip to NYC, New England and Canada and decided on this hotel based on good TA reviews. Well I can confirm the positive reviews. This hotel is all that you need for NYC. It's very well located being close to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre and the subway. The first room we had was at the back of the hotel and had no view but it was quiet. The room was small and it was difficult to open all our suitcases - wifey has a suitcase that is in two halves so it needs the floor space of an average billard table to be able to open it. If you stand the suitcase up it doubles as a walk-in-robe!The decor is very tastefully done as was pointed out by wifey who knows about these things. I just wanted to know how many cable channels there were. The tariff is very reasonable (for NYC) and is value for money. I knew I had done well when the rest of the the people staying there were modest tourist types like ourselves with not a business man to be seen - not even one trying to save on his travel allowance.Also not much English was being spoken and it sounded like some Eastern European languages which had me wondering how they got the word about this hotel.The breakfast is included and is well run.On return to NYC we stayed in the front of the hotel in a much larger room and it had a good view of the small park opposite. Make sure you ask for a non-smoking room as they have both.My only gripe. The lift (elevator) at the back makes a pinging noise on every floor and in the lift (elevator) you feel like you are in a German U-Boat being pinged by a Royal Navy destroyer. How about killing that pinger?"
16,1935,"Oct 29 2009 	Super stay in great location	Booked this hotel using Tripadvisor due to location and good reviews.In a city of spectacularly rude people this hotel has miraculously found a set of very friendly, efficient, eager to please staff. Rooms were good sized and clean, breakfast was fine and started the day off well. Great location, only a couple of minutes walk to Times Square but in a (relatively) quiet street. Would not hesitate to stay here again."
17,1935,"Oct 26 2009 	Third time's the charm!	This is the 3rd time I have stayed at this hotel since 2006. It is no longer the Super 8, and I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to see the extensive renovations the new management has accomplished. Our room was very nice and sufficient for its purpose. All staff were kind and considerate. I wish the continental breakfast area (updated decor with plenty of space) was open earlier than 7 am, but aside from that, it is a great value!!!! Very good bagels :) I gladly tipped the attendant as he is the hardest working guy in that breakfast room, as well as courteous. I definitely will book this hotel again. Location is a plus as well."
18,1935,"Oct 25 2009 	The beds are worth the price alone.	Just back from a weekend stay here, and I will begin with the raves...THOSE BEDS. By far the most comfortable beds and pillows I have ever experienced. We stayed in a family suite that had plenty of space for all of our things. The large, flat screened TVs were a pleasant surprise, and my teen-ager loved the I-Pod dock. The room was decorated so prettily in soothing sage greens, with dark wood furniture, that we loved coming in from a long day in the city. Bottom-line, the brand spanking newness of the rooms make your stay here.Second, the hotel is very, very clean. Our room was spotless. Did I say we loved our room? Good.Third: location. On 46th btw 5 &amp; 6th, this hotel is smack in the middle of everything. We traveled all over the city from this prime location with no problem. We were especially grateful for the bus that went down Fifth on a rainy fall night - it stopped right at 46th and we were in the hotel in no time at all. Believe me, I was loving the location that night.Fourth: any concerns we had were taken care of immediately: pillows were brought in minutes, etc.The rest are quibbles and not deal breakers: the elevators are miniscule and you will wait. Still, for how small and how full the hotel is, it could have been worse. Check out early to avoid the long lines at the desk area, which is small and gets crowded super fast. The breakfast offering did not appeal to me. The coffee looked horribly weak, the doughnuts sugary sweet, and so on. My preference, others seem to like it. We skipped it. Still, things were well-stocked, clean, stored well. The front desk help could have cracked a smile more often. Still, I can look past weak coffee, apathetic front desk people and even a Barbie-sized elevator for those heavenly beds and that pretty family suite. It's the big things that matter, and this hotel has them covered."
19,1935,Oct 24 2009 	Great hotel and location	I would definitely stay at the Hotel at Times Square again. I loved the location. It was a very nice room for the price. The room was nicely decorated and was very clean. You can't beat the price. The bed was very comfortable.
20,1935,"Oct 22 2009 	This is the place to be in NYC.	On-line booking and fearing the unknown is quite stressful when it comes to spending money these days. We went to this place on a recommendation based on its prior name and location. It's been newly renovated. WE WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! What a great place! We booked a 2-room family suite on the 10th floor. Perfect location with all of the basic needs. What a great time we had on the long weekend. We saws the sites and walked almost 9 miles in total that weekend. It was a great time had by all of us. Staff was friendly, continental breakfast was sufficient, and seeing the glow of Time Square steps away was just far enough to sleep peacefully at night. Look no further in the haystack of hotels. This was a great little place to stay. AAA discount, as well. Discount parking available just a block away."
21,1935,"Oct 21 2009 	Not to be recommended	We cannot recommend anyone stays at this hotel, unless you want to wake up in the middle of the night to find a large rat rummaging through your luggage and then chasing you round the room as it tried to escape.The good news is though that the hotel advise they have now employed an exterminator service to help try and control the situation.Happy hunting, we shall not be back to check on the progress."

23,1935,"Oct 14 2009 	Very Happy - This was a Good Find!	My wife &amp; I stayed here 6 nights beginning October 7 and were Very Happy, especially with the price under $200. The excellent TripAdvisor reviews were mostly accurate. However, here are a few clarifications regarding some reviewers' negative comments. First, the hotel IS only 1.5 blocks from Times Square. You have to remember that the east-west blocks in Manhattan are much longer than the north-south blocks. So it may seem longer than 1.5 blocks, but it technically is that length. Regardless, it's an easy, enjoyable walk to Times Square, as it is to other points of interest such as Rockefeller Center, Theaters, the Diamond District, 5th Avenue shopping, etc. GREAT LOCATION! Second, some people really seemed to be hung up on the &quot;glass door&quot; for the bathroom. Don't worry - it's no big deal. The doors are frosted and textured (see picture attached to this review). At the most, you can only see a silhouette if someone is in the bathroom unless that person is right up tight against the door. If you're rooming with that person, neither of you should feel uncomfortable with seeing a person's silhouette. The door is actually modern and attractive. Third, the breakfast room is more than adequate in size, the breakfast is very good, and it is a wonderful feature not duplicated in most other NY hotels. Some reviewers have complained about the breakfast being very basic and the room being too small. Well, here's the scoop: There were ample supplies of FRESH, high quality bananas, apples, cereals, oatmeal, bagels, English muffins, bread/toast, donuts, chilled yogurt, chilled juices, hot coffee, and tea. There is a full-time attendant there working his buns off and he deserves every dollar in the &quot;tip bowl&quot; on the counter. It looked like most folks appreciated the nice attendant and the wonderful breakfast feature, because the tip bowl was always fairly full. We never had to wait for a place to sit, even though the hotel was very busy. Even when it was fairly crowded, tables turned over quickly and no one had to wait more than a minute or two. Fourth - Sure we had to wait anywhere from 1-15 minutes for the free internet service in the lobby at busy times, but most of the time we picked less busy times of the day and walked right up to one of the two unoccupied computers. We printed our boarding passes, confirmed reservations, read emails, etc with ease. This was a very nice service. Plus the wireless connection in our room worked flawlessly with our Ipod Touch. And fifth, the two elevators were actually quite fast. They both were in service except when one was tied up for housekeeping (they had big loads at certain, but short, times of the day. We were on the 12th floor and had to wait up to 5 minutes only once or twice in six days.We had a large, very nice room with King-size bed (no extra cost when we booked a couple months earlier). The bed was very comfortable, the flat screen tv was great, the room was quiet and very clean. We had an interior room (no view) but still thought it was a great room.Sure there were a few minor rough spots at the hotel, but we had no real complaints at all. If I had to note the things that were less than &quot;perfect&quot;, this would be my list: the front desk staff was somewhat inconsistent - from very nice, efficient and professional to much less professional (one guy in particular). One of the concierge staff was not friendly or helpful and looked as though it was torture for her to work with the guests looking for information. The guest room and hallway doors automatically close and aren't adjusted or cushioned properly. Every door closes with a BANG which can sometimes be alarming in the middle of the night. But overall, these were just minor issues.We will return to this hotel for sure and will highly recommend it to other travelers. Hope this review and photos help."
24,1935,"Oct 13 2009	Excellent hotel	My daughter (24) and I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel on Oct. 7, 2009 and were very pleased. Nice lobby, very clean room with VERY good mattresses, bathroom well equipped. Very adequate breakfast.Location is just perfect - very centrally and not too noisy (which is hard to find in NYC).Can certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again."
25,1935,"Oct 12 2009 	Amazing location and nice people.	The location is really excelent, even if you hanvent been to New York before. Just 2 minute walk to Times Square and one minute walk to Fifth Avenue. The rooms are smal, especially the double, but have good TV, clean bathroom and great bed. The people at the hotel are very nice and honest. Great stay - if I return to NY I'll be back!"
26,1935,"Oct 10 2009	Convenient and good value	My sister and I were just staying one night in New York while we went to the US Open. The hotel was convenient to the subway, which took us directly to Flushing Meadows. It seems to be pretty well located if going to Broadway or other sight seeing adventures. There was only one reception clerk at check in time and there was a line. It went slowly, primarily because one of the guests had a problem. The clerk seemed a little flustered, but remained professional. The room was clean and newly remodeled. It was very loud outside, starting at 5am. The shower head was heavenly. Very adequate continental breakfast provided. I would definitely stay again."
27,1935,"Oct 9 2009 	Great location highly reccommended!	We had great service the whole 2 days we were there. Front desk people were very nice. We were able to buy tour bus tickets at hotel from very helpful and patient lady at service desk. Included basic breakfast of bagels, cereal and doughnuts. We had two rooms and both were very clean and not as small as I had expected. There were some spots in the hotel that needed minor repair or touch-ups, but overall it was nice and was very clean. The location was great. Two short blocks from Times Square and 1 block from 5th Ave. I thought it was noisy at night (although my husband didn't notice), might be better to have a room that didn't overlook the street. We had a great experience and it was the best price we found in that area for that weekend. Would definitely reccommend!"
28,1935,"Oct 8 2009 	Now that it's remodeled we'll go back there year after year!	We love this hotel! The lobby is modern and beautiful. Our room was the perfect size for the two of us; it was updated, clean, and quite comfortable. The staff was professional and helpful, although we had no problems they needed to attend to. We enjoyed the generous continental breakfast in the newly remodeled spacious breakfast area. The location, so close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, and subways, has always been important to us, and we couldn't ask for a more convenient spot. It's a great value for the money. We travel to NYC every fall, and will definitely go back to the Hotel at Times Square!"
29,1935,"Oct 6 2009 	Great stay	This is the 4th time I've stayed at this hotel and it was definitely the best visit as the renovations are finally finished. We had a room on the 9th floor; the room was decorated very nicely and quite large - it could have accommodated 2 cots in addition to the 2 queen beds. Room was very quiet (until at the dot of 7:00 a.m. each morning the construction outside began); bed was comfortable; housekeeping did a great job. The breakfast room has been enlarged and is organized much better than in the past. The breakfast offered is basic: bagels, toast, yoghurt, fruit and oatmeal, but a nice extra included in the price. The foyer and lobby have been updated and there are lots of couches and flat screens around, in addition to 2 computers and free internet access. The young lady who organizes tickets, etc. is most helpful in the lobby. The elevators can be slow, particularly at peak times, but no big deal. You can't beat the location of this hotel and we received a very reasonable rate. I will definitely continue to book this hotel in the future."
30,1935,"Sep 29 2009 	Just about perfect!!!!	Spent 4 nights here and have to say we couldn't have been happier. The twin queen bed rooms are spacious and well maintained. House keeping service was excellent and friendly. The breakfast downstairs was vey good,nice fresh doughnuts and bagels,butter kept in a mini fridge[great touch].Somebody has thought out customer service.My only mild negative was the in room coffee very weak needed two packs to make one good cup and please let's have china cups and saucers instead of styrotex.This will be my future base anytime I'm in Manhattan."
31,1935,"Sep 29 2009 	Best Deal in NYC!	I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. The service was great 24/7. We arrived early and couldn't go to our room but they let us check in and took all our baggage for us and stored it until we came back. The front desk and concierge were always very friendly and always went out of their way to help any way they could.The lobby of the hotel was very updated and modern. It had two computers that could be used by the guests at any time and lots of seating area. There was a fitness room and a HUGE breakfast room downstairs - the continental breakfast was really well done and a nice inclusion to an already affordable hotel.Compared to other hotels in this class/price range, the rooms were huge - ours had two double beds, a desk w/ chair, a flat screen TV perched on a fair sized chest of drawers, an arm chair, a full sized closet, air conditioning and a four piece private bath. I read that some people complained that the bathroom door was frosted glass. I went with a girlfriend and we tested it - you couldn't see through the glass unless you were leaned up against it and trying!! It also had free local calling and an alarm with MP3/iPod compatibility, which was nice when getting ready to go out and hit the town! Everything was so new and SO CLEAN!! Our rooms were done everyday and we received full linen change and fresh towels. There were four pillows on each bed and extra blankets in the closet.The location was awesome. It's between 5th and 6th, but a little closer to 6th. It took us less than 5 minutes to walk to the middle of Times Square. Because we were one block from the busiest part, I didn't find it very loud at all (mind you, we were on the 10th floor). There is a little bar in the hotel that is super small, but has great service, atmosphere, and super cheap martinis! Definitely worth stopping there for a drink or two before heading elsewhere.I would definitely stay at this hotel again and I have been recommending it to anyone who will listen. You will not be disappointed."
32,1935,"Sep 28 2009 	Excellent value - great location	A friend and I stayed here for a 5 day vacation in early September. The hallways are tiny, but the rooms were spacious for NY standards, comfortable and, most importanly, clean. Good (FREE) continental breakfast and friendly staff. Great location...easy walking distance to Time Square, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station and other major attractions and close to major subway lines. For two friends travelling on a limited budget, this was an excellent hotel...highly recommended."
33,1935,"Sep 28 2009 	Very nice CLEAN and NEW furniture. Best price x location.	Perfect location, great price, decent breakfast. Room was very clean, has coffee machine, brand new tv, good tv channels, good lamps."
34,1935,"Sep 27 2009 	Great location- will return	We have stayed in many NYC hotel in different locations and this by far was the best for walking out your door into the heart of the &quot;tourist&quot; section of the city. Room was clean as was breakfast area and lobby, only negative was that our room and bathroom windown opened into the middle of the building. I would have been better off if I never opened the windown to see what was out there at all. Also, very nice bar on site, but the staff were very unfriendly and offered no local entertainment or food suggestions. Breakfast was standard cold cereal and bagels, but nothing I wasn't expecting. Overall, because of the how clean and updated the hotel was I would stay again for the cost. Also- we stayed here because it was near a subway that went directly to yankee stadium."
35,1935,"Sep 24 2009 	A real gem	After a very exhaustive internet search and months of planning this hotel was reccommended by a co-worker 1 week before our trip to NY. Great location, rooms were very clean, friendly/helpful staff, very quiet and comfy beds (so quiet and comfy we slept in and missed breakfast every morning!). We were surprised at the spacious rooms from what I read about the tiny rooms in NY hotels. We arrived at 1:00 and expected to store our luggage but our room was ready for us and storage on our day of departure was great so we didn't have to wheel our luggage around the streets. A nice surprise just across the street, a beautiful park and tribute to 9/11 victims (very touching) a quiet oasis to get away from the hustle and bustle of the streets. Very happy to have stumbled upon this hotel at the last minute. Glad to not have stayed right in Times Square as originally planned. Definately would reccomend to anyone! Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable and comfortable!"
36,1935,"Sep 17 2009 	Old Reliable...	I liked this hotel when it was the Super 8. The rooms are clean and the staff are very helpful. Despite the fact that there was a problem with the heater on the coldest day of January, I was supplied a space heater that worked just fine and within minutes. You can't beat the price and the location. I would definitely recommend and continue to stay in the future. In fact, I will be staying at the Hotel at Times Square next month."
37,1935,Sep 17 2009 	good location	stayed in this hotel which was in a great location just off Times Square.Free internet PC's in lobby.Room was quite small given the cost but sufficient.the only problem wass that the bed lonen appeared not to have been changed before I moved in. I only stayed one night so can't comment on longer stays.continental breakfast in mornings was mediocre.Overall too expensive for the quality of rooms and service.
38,1935,Sep 9 2009 	Great Place to stay!	OMG Let me tell you about my visit to NY where we stayed at the Times Hotelfrom the moment we checked in until we left-4 days and3 nights the staff were so friendly and helped us in any and all ways. The room was clean and we loved the room we had with the extra space. Being from Texas we were a bit concerned about security-no need for that because they have the best. I would defiantly recommend the Times Hotel to any who makes a trip to NY.
39,1935,"Sep 9 2009 	Nice hotel good location and value mediocre breakfast slow elevator	Stayed here over Labor Day. Nice, well-maintained, fairly new hotel with a good location near Times Square. Great value at $153 a night, I thought, though the advertised queen beds were smaller than a full. Main drawback was very slow elevators and a mediocre breakfast (which was free, so it's hard to complain too much). Rooms were small but well decorated and maintained-very clean. Friendly staff."
40,1935,"Sep 8 2009 	No problems as usual	We have stayed here many times over the years. We kept going back since it is a solid hotel in NYC - clean rooms, good service, great location, breakfast and fitness room."
41,1935,"Sep 7 2009 	A good hotel for a decent price good location	We were traveling with our 1 Y.O baby, initially we got a really small room, and between the suitcases, the baby stuff and everything else, we had to hop around and over things just to get to the bathroom or out...The next day we asked to switch room and we were immediately transferred to a substantially bigger room.The rooms are nice and clean, the service we got was quick and helpful.There are only 2 elevators and one of them worked only half the time, though this didn't usually seem to be a problem. They have two computers with free internet access in the lobby, not a lot of privacy but it's quick and free.The breakfast is very good, containing fruits (apples and Bananas) cereal, different kinds of buns, cheese jam etc, coffee, donuts, juice. The location is great, two minute walk(one block) from times square and very close to the subway."
42,1935,"Sep 5 2009 	Great except for one minor glitch	We stayed at the Hotel at Times Square for one night. We arrived very early in the morning, and &quot;checked in&quot; at about 9:00am. We were given our room assignment, put our bags in storage, but obviously not room keys. We returned to the hotel at about 9pm for the night. After retrieving our bags and getting our keys, we headed up to our room. We were on the 3rd floor in a section that was only serviced by an old-fashioned service style elevator, with an elevator operator and all. Our kids thought this was really fun. Our room was small but otherwise just fine. We were all in bed by around 10:30. At 10:45pm my husband heard someone trying to enter the room. He jumped out of bed. We had thrown the door lock/latch. He looked and it was a family. They apparently had been given this room too, complete with newly coded room keys. They were just as surprised as we were, I suppose. We called to the desk to let them know this family was on their way back. Obviously the next morning our room keys no longer worked. But other than the momentary panic/surprise of thinking someone is breaking into your room when you're in it, we had an excellent stay and it was a great value and location. The parking rates cannot be beat either."
43,1935,"Sep 3 2009 	Great location and very clean	The service from the time we checked in to the time we checked out was exceptional. The room was clean when we arrived and very spacious for a NYC hotel. Very up to date with a flat screen TV and nice bathroom. The bathroom was small for some people, but nice. We did not mind the size as we are used to small bathrooms. Odd though that the door was glass, which was weird staying with my daughter. The hotel offers free continental breakfast, bagels, cereal, juice, coffee. It was all we needed to start our day, and being free in NYC is really a great deal. The rate was chep too. Less than $500 for a 3 nite stay, during the US Open. Location was the best. A short walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and 5th Avenue shopping. Very close to Grand Central, and not too far from Penn Station where we came into the city. Subway is close by too. There is a small park across the street, which made it a nice feeling as well. Plenty of places to eat as well, for all tastes and budgets.The best thing about the Hotel @ Times Square was the location. Each nite we finished up in Times Square. And we felt very safe in the neighborhood.The thing we liked the least was our view. There is none. The window looks out into a fire escape in between buildings. All in all, that would not deterr me from going back. It was a great stay."
44,1935,"Sep 1 2009 	Clean Quiet Convenient and Reasonable	After an exhaustive search (almost bordering on obsessive!), I found the Apple Core site and finally decided on the Hotel at Times Square. I am in the third day of my trip staying here, and I have to say I have been extremely pleased with the hotel. I think it's a tiny bit of a stretch to call it a boutique hotel, but it definitely lives up to its current reputation as a very pleasant, clean and extremely convenient hotel. My room on the 11th floor has been so nice and quiet, the beds are luxuriously comfortable (so comfortable in fact that I've missed each of the free breakfasts so far because I've slept in so late!), the rooms are perfectly cleaned up every day, and the free wi-fi is a real bonus. I had a small problem with my bathtub drain not working, and they were up within 10 minutes to fix it. Very efficient.The one downside (noted by a previous reviewer as well) is that they give you plastic and styrofoam cups in the room. I also read that the breakfasts are served all on disposable plates with plastic utensils as well. From andenvironmental standpoint, I think it's extremely wasteful and I hope management seriously looks into providing real cups, dishes, and cutlery as soon as possible. In addition, if they truly are trying to promote themselves as a boutique hotel, all the more reason to cut out the tacky and wasteful disposables. The only drawback in my mind to this otherwise pretty great and reasonably priced hotel!"
45,1935,"Aug 23 2009	Location and amenities make for great value in NYC	We reserved this hotel from the Internet, and were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Everything looks new and clean. Our party stayed in two rooms. Our room was slightly larger than the other, but both had all of the amenities (TV, wireless internet, an alarm clock with an IPod dock, desk and chair, and nice en suite facilities). The ordinary continental breakfast was a timesaver, and the location allowed us to walk to the theatre district, to shopping, and to restaurants. They give discounts to AARP or AAA members. We could not have been more pleased, and will return in the future."
46,1935,"Aug 21 2009 	Nice Hotel near Times Square	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the last 2 days of a trip to NYC. We had stayed at the Ramada Eastside hotel, which is also part of the Apple Core chain of hotels. We wanted to stay in the hustle and bustle of Times Square, so decided to give this hotel a try, since we'd had a good experience at the Ramada.Overall, the Apple Core hotels are all pretty much the same. The rooms have been renovated and offer the same amenities at each hotel. I wrote a detailed review for the Ramada Eastside, so you can read that if you want more information.There are a few specific things about this hotel that are different from the Ramada Eastside. The staff at the Ramada Eastside were more personable, whereas the ones at The Hotel are a little less interested in you as a guest. The breakfast room at this hotel is packed in the mornings...a lot more tourists stay here with their families...so you may have to wait to find a table or place to sit and eat. Also, it's louder at this hotel, because of the location. The free wifi was a lot slower, and the computers downstairs were always occupied. Overall, it's just a busier hotel, with the same amenities you'd find at another Apple Core hotel."
47,1935,"Aug 19 2009	Location location location!! - but service standards a bit low and terrible consierge service	All who travelled and stayed at the hotel = Me: 29/female; Partner: 30/male; father 64/maleMy boyfriend and I took my father on one of our many trips to NYC. We chose this particular hotel because my father has some health problems and cannot walk far distances. In NYC, this is problematic of course because it is a pedestrian city. I promise that this hotel was the very best hotel to stay at with my Dad on the trip because it was the closet hotel to everything (most tourist sights) that tourists have heard of and want to see. We were a mere couple of blocks from Father Duffy Square in Times Square, and we were right in the middle of the theatre district (mere blocks from all the shows we went to see).Upon arrival, yes we also had the fellow who could not speak a word of english, but he was friendly enough. We were also provided little &quot;welcome&quot; packages of the small things you might need or have forgotton (toothbrush, toothpaste, tylenol, etc). It was a nice touch. There is also complimentary continental breakfast served every morning. Fitness centre and high speed interent included as well as boutiques on the main floor. The rooms themselves are standard sized (we stayed in a 2 bedroom double bed room). they are not incredibly small, but not overly large. They are comfortable enough. Our only issue was our television did not work when we arrived and we required extra pillow, so we called down to the front desk for service. It took a very long time for them to rectify the problem and to get more pillows to be honest, so we were a bit put off by their service standards.Clean rooms and it was nice to see that they had extra soap, shampoo and conditioner (knowing we were a party of three).The consierge looked to be a summer student who did not really care too much about her job. I asked her where I could get tickets for Billy Elliot, and she told me &quot;the box office&quot;. Duh. I know that, but they are sold out and usually consierge helps out with this sort of thing. She was very hopeless and definitely NOT helpful.The Hotel is right beside a Dress Barn too, so ladies, lots of dress shopping too! We were staying there when the Pride Parade was going on and it was simply a block up the street, so it was convienient.A negative comment (besides the horrible consierge) would be that one of their two elevators was out of service, so we had to wait a LONG time for an elevator. A few times we took the stairs (we were on the 6th floor).In general, we would stay again just based on the location itself. Awesome location! Again, the rates my boyfriend found a decent rate of $160 for the first 3 nights and then $180 for the last two nights. Not too bad for such a great location. We would stay again....but do not suggest relying on the consierge for anything."
48,1935,"Aug 11 2009	be aware	I was given one price on cheap hotels when i reserved it, for 159,, then upon check in, they tried charging me over 200,,,, i showed the NON english speaking man and woman my printout,, so they still didnt honor my rate, they charged me 3 dollars over what i was given online,, when i got home and checked my card, they over charged me by 65 dollars,, i called they said they would call back, 4 hours later, he tells me that they over charge in case i watched movies or made phone calls. I was like &quot;you knew when i checked out that I did not do that.&quot; so he says they will credit in 4 to 5 days, i now have to wait and see. Which is frustrating, becuase makes me wonder now what will they do with my credit card info. very dishonest. i will never stay here again. Its not as close to times square as they say,,, its about 6 blocks, and its not worth staying here. we were never thanked for check in or check out, and never told about any hotel amenities. never were told about the buffet, or fitness room, they must think we are mind readers. the consegierge, sent us the wrong way to the location we needed."
49,1935,"Aug 10 2009 	Best thing is the LOCATION! Easy to get everywhere	We just spent 6 days with our children ages 15 and 13. We booked a non-smoking suite--which had two bedrooms. One had a King bed and the other a Queen. Yes, the bathroom door was a bit see-thru. HahaWe found this hotel to be a great choice. Located in Midtown, it is easy to get everywhere in NYC, yet the actual street it is on (&quot;Little Brazil&quot;) is quite quiet. Our rooms were small, but clean. The beds and pillows were awesome. We didn't plan to spend much time in our rooms, so the size didn't bother us. And because the hotel is located in a charming, older building, it is built like a rock with thick walls. We heard NO noise at all even though our rooms were located near the elevators.The continental breakfasts are only moderate, but suitable: Cold cereals, toast, bagels, doughnuts, coffee, juices, fruit and yogurts. It is definitely a good value."
50,1935,"Aug 7 2009 	Very nice excellent value!	Hi! I just wanted to contribute to good overviews of the place. After reading tons of reviews on Tripadvisor I finally booked the Hotel at Times Sq. and stayed there for 10 days in the beginning of May 2009. The key thing to share is that it is a great location for visitors, clean rooms and friendly staff. I would not say the place is luxury, it is just nice and clean with nothing disturbing or annoying. I have a very pleasant impression of the place and would definitely recommend it to people who came to see the city and not stay in the hotel for long. However, I should admit that very often one of two elevators does not work, one of two PCs with free Internet access in the lobby does not work, the breakfast is the same everyday. But believe me it is not that crucial for the money you pay."
51,1935,"Aug 5 2009 	...a little bit of heaven....	It was sure nice to come home to The Hotel @Times Square every night, after our adventurous, shopping and sight seeing days in New York! Everything you have read in all the other reviews is pretty accurate, and we enjoyed everything about the hotel, even our bathroom door. As you may have already read, the bathroom door is pretty see through, with some clear and crystal striping in the middle. To remedy this, I took a hanger out of the closet, and took a bath towel and clipped it lengthwise and hung it on the hook on the door. Viola'....problem fixed! You will find other places to stay in New York, but nothing that compares to this little piece of heaven, with as great a location and price, as The Hotel@ Times Square!!!"
52,1935,"Aug 4 2009 	EXCELLENT VALUE CLEAN CLOSE TO EVERYTHING QUIET AREA	This hotel was great. Worked for my family. Rooms are not huge, but clean and bright. The morning breakfast is a great way to start your day. Staff was excellent. After looking at prices at other hotels, I thought that this place had to be a dump for what they were charging. I am happy to say I was wrong. The place is great. Just 1-1/2 blocks from times square. 1/2 block from 5th ave shopping. Worked great for wife, 2 kids 7 and 13 year olds. I really liked that you could get away from the mobs of crowds on times square. Right across from hotel is a nice plaza to relax in, and the best pizza slices are next to the plaza on 45th st. called Little Italy Pizza. Get the Calamari pizza slice, you will not regret it. We stayed 3 nights and were very happy with the hotel and its central location to sites, shopping, theaters, restaurants and subway right around the corner. I have stayed in nicer, larger hotel rooms that are true five star, but for the price to value you get, it is a five star stay in my book. I will be back to this place to stay again, I just hope that they do not get to popular, and raise the prices of the rooms."
53,1935,"Aug 1 2009 	Very Nice Accommodations Great Location Excellent Value	We just returned from 4 nights in the Hotel at Times Square. What a wonderful find! The hotel is is on West 46th street between 5th and 6th Avenues. It is an easy walk to Grand Central, Rockefeller Plaza, Times Square and Subway/Metro stops. Your hotel stay includes a reasonable breakfast (hot and cold cereals, fruit, yogurt, rolls, milk, coffee, hot chocolate, juices. The breakfast area is pleasant, well maintained, and has a goodly amount of seating. Our room had a king size bed and was very spacious by NYC standards. The A/C worked fine. The hotel has been recently refurbished. Front desk staff were courteous and helpful. A daily newspaper was included as was free WiFi access in the rooms. There is computer and printer access in the lobby to print boarding passes or check your email if you didn't bring a laptop. The hotel also has a cozy bar/lounge that serves very reasonably priced wine, beer, and cocktails. No restaurant in the hotel, but many, many to choose from in the immediate vicinity. All in all we were very pleased with our choice and would stay there again in (as they say) &quot;a New York Minute!&quot;"
54,1935,"Aug 1 2009 	Wonderful NYC theatre district find.	My wife and I travel from Baltimore to NYC a few times a year for theatre and are always on the lookout for good deals on hotels in the theatre district. We book through the Quikbook website or by phone through their toll-free number. We recently spent three nights at The Hotel at Times Square and will certainly return. It has been recently renovated. The decor is upbeat. The rooms are adequate size, good beds and very clean. Buffet breakfast is included. Free phone calls from the room and free computer access in the lobby. It seems the owners have made a special effort to provide the cost-conscious visitor with all they really need for a good experience. The only downside was the concierge service."
55,1935,"Jul 27 2009 	A clean pleasant facility at a reasonable price in a great location.	We've stayed in this hotel twice, certainly will go back again. Rooms are clean and well maintained, the continental breakfast (included in room price) is quite satisfactory and is offered in a newly remodeled, pleasant breakfast room. The staff is most welcoming and accommodating. The location, just a couple of blocks from Times Square and a very short walk (even with a suitcase!) from Grand Central Station, couldn't be better. We literally walked everywhere we went--museums, shopping, Circle Cruise, Central Park, theaters, and great restaurants. If you bring a car, discounted parking is available across the street. We're picky, and we highly recommend The Hotel at Times Square."
56,1935,"Jul 27 2009 	Best Kept Secret in NYC	Booked this property based on reviews read here. The price was great ! The price actually dropped after I made my online reservation, made a call and they adjusted it immediately. The room was new, clean and not huge but big enough. The staff was friendly, the lobby area was nice, the free computers were great (had to wait sometimes but not long) The free breakfast was sufficient and definately saved us some money. Were were a few blocks from TImes Square, Steps away from 5th avenue and Rockefeller Center. The Subway (BDF) was just around the corner. I lived in NY for 30 years and this was my first trip back in 15 years. I could find no better deal online for any other hotel. At 165.00 a night this was the best kept secret in NYC. Would highly recommend and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Explained subway and alternative routes that enhanced our experience.Be sure to show AAA or other discount card -- they do check!Computer/internet use included. Computer available in lobby and WIFI in room.Breakfast is crowded. Don't wait until 10:00.I highly recommend the hotel. Great value - excellent location."
59,1935,Jul 26 2009 	The most pleasant SURPRISE!	I booked this hotel because of it's resonable price in it's location. I was most pleased when I arrived. The hotel looked as if it had been recently renovated and the location is awesome. One block from 5th Ave and about two blocks from Times Square! They served a continental breakfast every morning. The staff was very friendly and accomondating. AAA discount and they even gave us a discount on the long term parking. It will be the first place I book if ever I return to the Big Apple!
60,1935,"Jul 24 2009 	Great value at terrific location in The Heart og Midtown Manhattan !	We were 2 groups of 3 persons from Denmark visiting the highlights of The former New Amsterdam, and loved the hotel and location. Terrific value including free breakfast (OK but not great), fast WiFi internet in the room, in-room safes, coffee maker, good air conditioning, etc.The location can not be better if interested in seeing the major sights of The City. 5 minute walk to Times Square, just off of 6th Ave, and a 3 minute walk to the best part of 5th Avenue.We got a cheaper rate than originally booked y continually checking the hotel's web-site, and the price went down 30 dollars pr. room pr. night jujst days before our visit, so we re-booked at the lower rate.The beds were great, the rooms good-sized for New York, and the bathrooms large and very clean. LCD tv, etc.The hotel staff was genuinely interested in the guests having an enjoyable stay."
61,1935,"Jul 22 2009 	Nice hotel but only 1 elevator operates	All in all it was a very nice stay. Clean rooms. Maid service was kind enough to leave plenty of shampoo and conditioner. Management was always warm and welcoming. Conceriege didn't have any stamps available for purchase for post cards. But most problematic was only one elevator in operation. When I inquired management informed us know they were just wrapping it up. However the very next day they started on the other elevator.....Elevator is used for handymen, maids and guests for all 12 floors."
62,1935,"Jul 22 2009 	Great Value for Money Hotel in NYC	The Hotel at Times Square is a great find for a reasonable priced hotel in NYC. My stay was for 6 nights and I had a large room on the 10th floor. i didnt expect a view as I wasnt in NYC to look out my hotel window. This hotel is close to everything you need for an exciting stay in this large city. The breakfast was an extra bonus and offered the perfect selection for an Aussie traveler, as we are fans of cereal and toast for breakfast. The only thing missing was Vegemite! The staff were all friendly and helpful, answering every query cheerfully and with great knowledge of their city. If I ever make it back to New York I will be booking a stay at The Hotel at Times Square again. Keep up the good work!"
63,1935,"Jul 20 2009 	Excellent value service and location	Stayed for 5 nights recently. It's excellent value with modern, renovated rooms, good solid service and wonderfully clean. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped and serviced very well. Location is great, round the corner from the subway, safe and walking distance to so much. The hotel management obviously knows something about customer service and this shows in the staff dealings with guests. They respond quickly and appropriately to any issues. The breakfast buffet is more than adequate with a nice variety of food, continental style. The only criticism I have is that there are only styrofoam and plastic plates and utensils available and nothing seems to be recycled. I know there's no kitchen at the hotel, so they can't provide reusable dishware, but can't they find a way to recycle? This is just a personal beef. I'm already planning a return trip to NY and will definitely stay here again."
64,1935,"Jul 16 2009 	Great Hotel!!!	The hotel was GREAT!!!! The location, free breakfast, room size, and internet access made our stay a wonderful experience. My only complaint is only one of the elevators was working which lead to a sometimes long wait and my room was on the 9th floor. I would stay again with no hesitation."

66,1935,"Jul 15 2009 	Great Location and the concierge made it easy to plan our day!	We came for a week of shows, shopping and sight seeing. We had a problem when we first arrived regarding our room, but the staff at the front desk resolved it quickly and very much to our satisfaction. We were happy with our room, and the shower was great. The continental breakfast was a great start to every day. The location of the Hotel at Times Square was perfect for all of our outings. The concierge was able to assist us with directions and best means of transportation, making it easy for us to plan our day. We would definitely go back."
67,1935,"Jul 15 2009 	Charming and Clean Hotel in Heart of NYC	We stayed in this hotel 7/4-7/7 and enjoyed it very much. The room although smaller was perfect for the two of us. Everything was modern and new and looked really nice. We arrived at LGA at 11:30am and the hotel was all set with a room for us for 12 noon, no wait whatsoever! The only issue was one elevator was broken so only using one had really long waits. Sometimes you would hit the buttom on the 9th floor and it would skip you twice! You just had to be patient, and sometimes just give up and take the stairs. The bed was extremly comfortable and the flat tv a very nice touch. The free wireless internet was great too! This property is close to everything, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave all minutes away! The rate was great too at only $125/night for 2 ppl, you can't be it! The breakfast was decent, we only ate it once. The line was kind of long at 9:30am but that was fine. All in all a great stay!"
68,1935,"Jul 13 2009 	Great Hotel	We have stayed at this hotel many times. We are going again in two weeks--this time with our son and his family. Our granddaughter has to go to the hospital for a few days in the city. We are looking forward to our stay at this location when we check out of the hospital. This hotel has always been nice, great helpful staff, and we are looking forward to seeing the renovations. Always a pleasure to stay here."
69,1935,"Jul 6 2009 	Excellent accomodations and great price	It may seem odd to write &quot;great price&quot; for a NYC hotel, but that description is accurate for The Hotel at Times Square. The location is about 2 blocks off Times Square and the price was great. It was over $100 less than the Holiday Inn Express and the rooms were much bigger. The morning breakfast was very good; nothing fancy but serviceable. The hotel has been remodeled recently so the rooms all look very modern. Parking was only $23/day, which is very good for downtown. Great hotel!"
70,1935,"Jul 6 2009 	Comfort Location Staff and Value - TOP NOTCH!!	My family recently stayed in this hotel - daughter and family in one room, husband and myself in another. We totally enjoyed everything about our stay! The continental breakfast (FREE!) was a great way to start our day, and provided a wide variety of foods for all. Hotel beds were extremely comfortable, staff very friendly and helpful, and location for all &quot;tourist&quot; attractions couldn't have been better. We felt very safe coming and going at all times. The hotel's cleanliness was evident, as the janitorial staff could be seen working throughout the day. Although not your fancy NY hotel, the value was fantastic, and served our purpose well. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and I intend to book again this fall, when I return for a &quot;girls only&quot; trip! Thanks for a great stay!"
71,1935,"Jun 30 2009 	exceptional staff and total amenities	I choose the hotel for it's location only, but was very surprised at how great the staff treated us. The amenities were also fantastic. I encountered a small problem with the parking facility and when I notified Sonny, the manager, my credit card was credited the overage immediately."
72,1935,Jun 26 2009	Great hotel staff	Thanks to the staff at this hotel who really went the extra mile to return a lost wallet to us. This kind of honesty and responsibility is indeed a wonderful thing in a hotel staff.
73,1935,"Jun 24 2009 	A good place to stay	8th to 13th June 2009.THE Reception Staff were Polite &amp; Effecient.

74,1935,"Jun 23 2009 	excellent hotel in great location	basically really loved this hotel. i grew up in NY but was not able to stay with family like we usually do and we were travelling with friends and teenagers. so, with tickets in hand to a broadway show and only a couple of days to explore the city, i wanted a place close to the heart of the city and close to transportation. we lucked out with this smallish hotel with a classic architecture on a street between fifth and sixth avenues - there are subways within a couple of blocks in 2 directions, the street is fairly quiet and the rooms are roomy, believe it or not (plus they are quiet and you can regulate the temperature well). Ask for a room on the east side - til they build the new building next door, you'll have large windows with a nice view (the west side rooms seem to have narrow windows facing a narrow alley). the bathrooms are small but very nicely outfitted and the variety of good breakfast offerings kept us satisfied all morning to give us more time to search for a great lunch (!). there's an easy to use safe in each room and altho the elevators are slow, we didn't mind. also, there is parking available for about $30/24hrs and the rooms are nicely decorated and thoughtful things like an iHome are there for your iPod to play music. i don't usually write reviews, but i thought i should pass on the news that you can stay close to the center of the city for a very good price (on the applecore web site we paid $175 for Sat nt and $145 for Sunday - plus tax) and be comfortable and happy."
75,1935,"Jun 23 2009 	Great value great location lots of info. in review.	Overall, for the money, this was a great value in Manhattan. We booked it directly though applecore.com and checked back frequently and got a lower rate by rebooking. We paid $130 a night. They had the best rate available from various websites. And it included a free continental breakfast and free wireless internet and computers/printer in the lobby.I will start with my problem issues:1. Biggest complaint - elevator service. They have 2 elevators, but at almost every time we used them, one was out of service for some unknown reason. It varied and wasn't always the same one, so it clearly wasn't an &quot;out of order&quot; issue. Frequently had long waits for the elevator.2. Bathroom window didn't lock, and it was accessible from the fire escape. 3. Breakfast lines were long and seating not available when we went each day.4. Maid service questionable. They did not restock our coffee or cups on any day. We had to repeatedly call each day for coffee packets.5. Trouble making calls to front desks - phones not working or busy, not sure.6. We found a pair of flip flops in our room one day, presumably left by room service. We actually didn't figure this out until we were leaving, as I and my niece both thought they belonged to the other person. Didn't have time to complain at checkout, but it is bothersome in retrospect to have someone in our room and leaving things. Looked like a man's flip flops.7. 2 computers in lobby always in use, though didn't have to wait long to use.8. Beds were double beds, not queen beds, as I thought the website said.Now, the good things.1. Great value for price.2. Great tourist location - a couple blocks from Times Square and the Theatre district. Close to Rockefeller Center. Close to 5th Avenue shopping. Can walk to Empire State Bldg (about 1 mile) and south side of Central Park (about 1 mile). 3. Nice room decor, large rooms, clean. Recently remodeled.4. Free wireless internet. 2 computers and printers in the lobby for printing out online tickets, etc. They could use more computers, as they were always in use though people seemed to get off quickly if you stood there and waited.5. Breakfast had good variety for continental breakfast - O.J., apple juice, milk, several cold cereals, oatmeal packets, variety of doughnuts, variety of bagles, toasters (with line), yogurt, bananas, and apples. We went between 9:30 and 10 each day (it closes at 10), and they hadn't run out of anything. Not enough seating at breakfast.6. Nice lobby.Highly recommend with caveats - the hotel could fix a few problems easily and make the experience better. I"
76,1935,"Jun 21 2009 	Look no Further! Best Value in Manhatten!	If you are looking for a clean, comfortable Hotel in Manhatten within walking distance of TKTS in Times Square, Broadway Theatres, good restaurants, a subway around the corner, look no further! The Manager, Sonny G., upgraded us from a double bedded to a queen bedded room, and when I told him I had medication that needed to be kept cold, he provided an in-room fridge at no charge. Our beds were supremely comfortable, bathroom was modern, my companions loved the breakfast (included), while I walked several blocks to Eight Avenue for fresh vegetable juice to maintain my glutenless diet,. There is a Kosher deli across the street, along with many other restaurants within walking distance, including the Edison Cafe, a few blocks away. The NY Public Library, Maceys, Lord and Taylor, Saks, Daffys, and lots of shopping possibilities are easily accessible by foot. Return trips to NYC will see us back at this Hotel! Thanks to the courteous, professional staff, especially Sonny G, from your Canadian fans!"

78,1935,"Jun 18 2009 	Great hotel and the price is just a bonus.	Stayed here in 2005 and the remodel has vastly improved the property. Very sleek modern rooms with amenities like flat screen tv, wifi, coffee maker and free breakfast make this the best value in NYC. Friendly efficient staff add to the experience. Will definitely stay again"
79,1935,Jun 13 2009 	great location!	The hotel at times square was in the perfect location. Its not dead center of times square but just a short couple of blocks. The guy at the front desk was always very nice. They were renovating when we were there which is the only reason I rated the cleanliness lower then the others. Im sure it will look great when its all done!If you plan on taking the subway (which is very very convenient and buy the day pass) make sure you get a map which was provided to us by a girl at a desk in the loby.I went with a group of 4 girls and we all packed at least 3 bags and the room was a bit snug so be prepared.
80,1935,"Jun 12 2009	Clean Convenient Affordable	newly remodeled, great continental breakfast, minutes from Times Square. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay there again. Paid under $200/night - great deal for the location"
81,1935,"Jun 11 2009 	Great little hotel	this was a great little hotel for my two night stay. Great location, comfortable bed, quiet, sleek modern furniture. Ella at the desk was helpful. The amenities are great and unexpected at this price - free breakfast, free internet, coffeemaker in the room, flat screen television. At first, I was disappointed that the hotel was not right on Times Square, but it's just a short two block walk and you're close to Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central. It's actually better. Nice Brazillian and spanish restaurants on the block. Don't miss the great juice cart and Indian food cart across the street. No complaints about this great little hotel."
82,1935,"Jun 7 2009 	Incredible Find!	We typically stay in name brand hotels, but took a chance and stayed at this hotel due to the great price and good reviews I read about on this site. I was not disappointed! This hotel is a true gem. The location is absolutely great! We were able to walk to Times Square, theaters, 5th Ave. shopping, subway stations and Rockefeller Center in a matter of minutes. The hotel is on a rather quiet, by New York standards, side street. The street is lined with interesting Brazilian restaurants. It is also in the heart of the Diamond District. Our room was ready when we arrived. The lobby is beautifully decorated and the entire hotel was very clean and comfortable. Our room on the tenth floor was large and featured a flat screen TV and other amenities. The front desk staff was very friendly. The breakfast each morning was basic bagels, toast, fruit, doughnuts, cereal, coffee and juice, but was always fresh and plentiful. The staff, who manned this area, made sure that everything was well stocked. The free breakfast alone saved us lots of money. Each night, after touring, we walked down to 8th, 9th and 10th Avenues, to eat at great little ethnic restaurants that gave us a local feel. They were much cheaper than the Times Square tourist traps and delicious. The Magnolia Bakery is only two blocks away from this hotel and we frequented it daily! The area was very safe and I would stay again at this hotel. I was very happy with everything about it."
83,1935,"Jun 6 2009 	Everything we expected no disappointments. Brilliant!!!!	On arrival to the hotel the Shuttle Bus tried to leave us at 44th st, 5th Ave, so i'm glad I did my homework and known where the hotel actually was. When we arrived the Reception Staff was very welcoming, and were happy to let us have our room early. Our room was just what we expected, no disappointments, everything we needed e.g safe, hairdryer, free wifi for our laptop was available! The room was very clean, and it was cleaned to a high standard everyday and with fresh towels left. We met our housekeeper a couple of times, and she was very friendly and helpful. The Breakfast was lovely, and the paper plates etc wasn't a problem, to be honest most restaurants used throw away plates etc. However, the Gentleman who worked in the breakfast room, who kept items filled and clear up, firstly he did do his job well, but he never seemed to smile, we tried everything to get a reaction from him, but with no joy. All in all though I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would stay here again!"
84,1935,"Jun 5 2009 	Excellent hotel in great location!	This was the best hotel I have stayed at in New York. It is also a great value. It was clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. And the hotel was in a fantastic location! Patrica, our maid on the 8th floor, was incredible! So friendly and helpful. Also, everyone at the front desk and at the concierge desk was extremely conscientious and knowledgeable. We will certainly stay at this hotel again."

86,1935,"Jun 1 2009	Clean spacious economical (for NYC) value.	We rented 2 rooms for 4 adults for 5 nights. We chose this hotel for the location &amp; the $ &amp; it did not disappoint. Close to Grand Central, Times Sq, Rockefeller &amp; subway. The rooms were spacious &amp; very clean with good beds. The bathrooms were nice &amp; the shower was great. Overall, the hotel personnel were helpful if not particularly friendly (seemed to be a NY attitude rather than anything else). The hotel needs to upgrade the sheets &amp; the concierge needs to be better trained. And both of our room doors squealed terribly - invest in some WD40! If you want a dark room, stay away from the 3rd floor front. Skip the continental breakfast &amp; go to the Dunhill on 45th &amp; 6th or the deli on 6th around the corner for a geat price. Overall, we found it to be a good deal for the price we paid. We'll definately stay here again."
87,1935,"May 29 2009 	Can't be beat!	I just returned from a 1-night stay with my sister and her 5 year old son. Nothing but good things to say about this place! Excellent location, spotless room, friendly staff and an amazing rate. The included breakfast was a nice extra, since I was traveling with a child. The breakfast dining room was large, bright and very clean, with a pretty good assortment to choose from. Our guestroom (2 double beds) was immaculate; our bathroom was stocked with plenty of extra towels and decent toiletries. We even received a little gift bag upon check in, which included additional toiletries...nice little extra. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
88,1935,"May 26 2009 	Liked it very much!!	The hotel is great for what you need to get around New York City! The location is awesome, 2 blocks off of Broadway going towards 5th Avenue..the hotel staff upon checking in and out were friendly, welcoming &amp; informative! The Central Parking across the street a few feet away from the hotel is excellent &amp; if you validate your parking ticket with the hotel, you get a discount! The rooms are small but the beds are WONDERFUL! The only 2 negative things I experienced but did not report to the front desk were, 1) the tv reception is HORRIBLE, you must do something about it, I know when you come to the city you shouldn't be in the room watching tv, BUT when you do return from walking all day and are relaxing ,a little tv wouldn't hurt, only there is no tv..nice flat screen tv, now only if you could make out whats on, and I was on the 11th floor near the door that seperates the staircase from the rooms, OMG! get some oil for the doors! Everytime someone came thru that door we heard , ccrreeaakkkkkkk....again, I know I didnt report it to the staff but hopefully you can fix these 2 small details for the next person, All in all, it was a wonderful hotel and I am spreading the word to friends an family! I will return again!"
89,1935,"May 26 2009 	Not worth the money I saved	I planned a weekend trip to New York. I selected this hotel for its vicinity to Times Square, its affordable rate and positive reviews. Unfortunately, that is all this hotel offers. 1. My sink and toilet were not working. 2. The overall impression of the hotel is that it is not frequently cleaned or maintained.3. The bed sheets were stained.4. The batroom had ants and stains.5. Breakfast room is icky.6. Vending machines are empty.7. Lobby bathroom is dirty. Like subway dirty.8. One member of the check-in staff was rude. The woman checking me in was rude - abnormally rude for New York. She huffed and puffed when she realized there was a problem with my reservation and had to call the reservation department. Seriously, she said in a deep sigh, &quot;Now I have to call reservations,&quot; and did so reluctantly. She couldn't even solve the problem or, in my opinion, she was unwilling to solve the problem and had me deal with their reservation department and Expedia. I guess she didn't realize I was the one on vacation."
90,1935,"May 22 2009 	Excellent value hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in May. The rooms were spotless, the free wif-fi was a great bonus, plus there is free use of the hotels business centre pcs complete with printer!The staff were very helpful and the location of this hotel is very central to midtown and close to subways . The rooms whilst being on the small side were more than adequate afterall when you visit NYC as a tourist you dont really expect to be spending much time in your hotel excep to sleep! We went for the free breakfast one day but in all honesty we preferred to seek out low-cost delis and have a different breakfast every day! All in all we would highly recommend this hotel."
91,1935,"May 21 2009 	All work AND play!	As a college recruiter I travel throughout NY state but mostly in the Five Borough Area. Whenever in NYC, I first try The Hotel at Times Square. I have stayed there many times in the past. The location is central to my schedule. There are numerous restaurants around the area and a parking lot kitty-corner across the street making this hotel very convenient. Often, my wife accompanies me on these trips. She plays while I work; shopping, theaters, museums are either within walking distance or just a bus ride away. After my work is done, we will take in a meal or go to some interesting tourist destination.The Hotel at Times Square staff is excellent. They are very friendly and efficient. they will seek to accommodate the guest as much as possible. there are both smoking and non-smoking rooms which are clean and comfortable. Recently, the Hotel was remodeled and is now very modern. We have traveled to Europe and find that the hotel has that European feel from the lobby to the decor in the rooms. In fact, many international tourists stay at this hotel.The continental breakfast is very good -- and free!"
92,1935,"May 14 2009 	For business or Broadway a good deal	Great value location for a mid-town business trip or a night at the theatre. Small, clean rooms with polite, if a bit cool staff.Close to Times Square, TKTS booth.Free breakfast is fine, if uninspired.Ask for a room on the lower floors facing south and you'll get no view, but you will get quiet."

Perfect location for seeing the best bits of NYC - the hotel is 5mins from Times Square and the Rockafeller Centre, 3mins to the nearest Starbucks and 2mins from the nice end of 5th Avenue!After reading all the whinging about small rooms for NYC hotels I was pleasantly surprised with a decent sized double room and compact, but perfectly adequate bathroom (no bath, just shower). Rooms were well equipped - coffee maker, big plasma screen, air con unit, safe etc etc.The only minor downfall is the breakfasts - buffet of bagels, toast, sugary cereals or doughnuts all served on plastic disposals plates / bowls - good effort on helping the environment there. Would have been nice if there were a few more healthy things to eat, but for a holiday it's fine.Don't be misled by the &quot;business centre&quot; - this is only 2 computers in the lobby with free internet &amp; printing, which is great, but more often than not you'll be waiting 30mins to get on them at all times of the day due to habitual facebook-checkers!"
95,1935,May 5 2009 	Great clean place to stay	This hotel was very very clean and the rooms were very nice. The staff were very accomodating. The beds were very comfortable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The rates were very very good. The breakfast they proivided was great. I highly recommend this hotel.
96,1935,"May 4 2009 	Decent Rooms; Great Staff	The hotel had no rooms when I arrived, and moved me to another hotel.I returned the next day - the staff were helpful, and friendly.The room was clean, tidy, and decent."
97,1935,"Apr 29 2009	I would definitely stay here again.	I arranged for a group of 20 people to travel to the city from West Virginia during our spring break. We arrived late but were checked in quickly. We found our rooms freshly remodeled and very clean. I slept in my comfortable bed with very clean sheets and blankets. Everyone in the group enjoyed the breakfast and liked that they could eat and get started early. The staff is very nice, Shelly with group reservations was especially helpful to me. Several people in the group stated they would stay here again. I only wish it had been a little closer to the theatres but I didn't mind the walk, even at night. We used our internet daily and that was a big plus. I would recommend this hotel to others."
98,1935,"Apr 28 2009 	Great location 	This was our second stay at the Hotel at Times Square. Our first stay was in 2004 when it was Super 8. We had a good stay then and a good stay this time. Not much has changed other than the name and a remodel. Hotel staff could be a little bit more friendly. We did see a GIANT cockroach in the lobby during our stay but only 1 and only once. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a squeeky hallway door near our room. We always had hot water even in the mornings. The maid staff were friendly but very slow on making up our room each day. The value with this hotel is the location as it is near many subway stops, proximity to Times Square and the inclusion of a FREE breakfast each morning. When you are trying to keep costs down the free breakfasts help you acheive that. The gym is very small but has two treadmills and a flat screen TV. No weights. The business center in the lobby with free internet is a huge bonus! I was able to keep in touch with home and check for directions. The only small problem is that there are only 2 computers and many of the other guests in the hotel seem to forget to keep their sessions short. I do recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Like others on this site have said: don't come looking for a 5 star hotel. Come looking for a nice hotel and a great value with a private bathroom."
99,1935,"Apr 25 2009 	Fantasic Brillient Hotel in a Great Postion.	Here i am on my last night in this great city of New York writing this review from my room at The Hotel at Times Square using the hotels FREE internet conection. First this hotel is in a great position just one block from Times Square and one block from the Rockerfella Centre and surrounded by restaurants, bars and irish pubs. There is plenty going on around here day and night and all the theatres within a short walk away.The rooms are on the small side but very clean and there is a work desk, 32&quot; flat screen tv with games consul and we have one king bed which is comfy and soft. Coffee and tea machine, Iron and Ironing board, Nice bathroom with nice powerfull shower with plenty of hot water. The staff at the front desk are friendly and helpfull and sent us two extra pillows within minutes of asking for them. The breakfast is ample with plenty of juice, cerial, toast, fruit and tea and coffee e.t.c. to start the day with. There is allso a small Bar which serves a pint of draught beer for just $3.00We are off down to Atlantic City tomorrow on the Gray Hound bus so look out for my review on the Bally's Atlantic City. Some i have read on Trip Advisor are not very good atall."
100,1935,"Apr 21 2009 	A great deal for the money - would definitely use again	This hotel has recently been refurbished and offers good facilities for a small (by NY standards) hotel. The rooms were a reasonable size, well equipped and serviced efficiently each day. The staff were all helpful, and the location (between Times Sq and 5th Avenue) was ideal. Whilst only a few minues walk from Times Square the location was quiet, and city noise was no problem. The (inclusive) continental breakfast was a bonus. I would definitely use this hotel again if staying in central New York."
101,1935,"Apr 21 2009 	Pleasant stay	Stayed at The Hotel at Times Square for three nights and found rooms to be very clean, ample room, pleasant desk and concierge staff and housekeeping staff. Will definitely stay there in the future."
102,1935,"Apr 19 2009 	Times Square's best kept secret!	We stayed here over Easter weekend/Passover and despite arriving in NYC at a very busy time, we couldn't find any fault with the service at this hotel. Location is great - 5 mins from Times sq, Rockefeller, St Patricks Cathedral and Radio City. Plenty of restaurants nearby, a Duane Reade drugstore just around the corner and Delis open late just along the street.Don't go expecting 5* luxury, but the rooms were clean, newly updated, bathrooms nice.Big plasma tvs in the rooms and an ipod dock too. Plenty of fresh towels everyday.The breakfast was a real bonus: tea, coffee, fruit juices, cereal, yoghurt, bagels, doughnuts and toast. Got a bit boring by the 5th day but who's complaining! Free wifi access in the rooms and 2 computers in the lobby with free internet access.The staff were very friendly and helpful and acted promptly if you had any problems.All in all we thought this hotel was excellent value and a fantastic location. We won't hesitate to return there nest time we're in NYC!"
103,1935,"Apr 19 2009 	Fantastic value-for-money hotel for hectic family trip to New York	The Hotel at Times Square describes itself as a newly renovated boutique hotel. I would say it's a superb value for money budget hotel with some great extras included in the package.We spent a week in The Hotel and loved enough to take time to write this review! At 59 W 46th St, The Hotel is actually closer to Rockefeller Centre - a plus for us, since it was quieter and less busy. I've been to New York many times on business, and usually stay on Central Park South - but our family budget for this trip was very different.The Hotel fitted the bill exactly. Before making our reservation, I looked at all the hotels I knew in New York - the &quot;hidden gems&quot; recommended by friends who live there, serviced apartments, and B &amp; Bs in Greenwich and Tribeca etc. When I cross-checked with TA ratings, I just couldn't find anything that was cheap enough for the four of us which didn't compromise on location or quality. The Hotel is in a perfect location from which to explore on foot, by bus or by subway; it's surprisingly quiet at night (I had requested a quiet room and the hotel kindly obliged); there are plenty of good family restaus close by (eg. John's Pizzeria 260 W 44th St, Lattanzi on W46 th St) when the kids are close to dropping and you simply need to eat something good in a convivial atmosphere; it offers free wi-fi; there's ample hot water at night and in the morning, and a good supply of towels; comfortable King-sized beds; and it's newly refurbished, clean and well-kept throughout. Our bedroom was spacious enough to have a small desk and a couple of chairs, however public areas are small. There's a contemporary-style foyer which can be a little crowded in the morning but as the hotel only has 140+ rooms, it doesn't bustle like the Hilton on Ave of the Americas. For Central Manhattan at $ 150-160 a night for four of us and a free upgrade to a junior suite - it couldn't have been better! I think The Hotel is a great find.We were delighted and I would definitely recommend it to all friends who are looking for a good base for a sightseeing/shopping trip to New York. In these austerity times, the location, comparatively spacious rooms, a basic gym and free wi-fi makes it a possible choice even for business trips. It might not have the presence or charm of The Library, W or the Essex House but as an honest quality budget hotel, it's hard to beat.The breakfast bar in the basement is utilitarian rather than appetising or full of choice - but there are good typical American diners only a block away. The Red Flame on 67 W 44th St is one where you'll find a full pancake and syrup stack, eggs and grits. The Hotel has a Tapas Bar on the 2nd Floor (we didn't visit) and no restaurant as such - but when New York is full of superb choice - why worry? If you have small or young children flagging with jet lag, you can even order in (and actually the Jewish deli across the way does great pastrami!) A small grouse - it would be nice if the hotel staff on reception were a little more welcoming and learned to smile! - but I can live without that.The hotel's own website lists its facilities as follows:Complimentary continental breakfast (7-10 a.m.)Free Wireless Internet access24 Hour Business center24 Hour Fitness center incl. the &quot;PowervibePro Workout Bench&quot; (didn't have time to try, but there are pictures on the hotel's on website)No charge for calls within the U.SUpstairs Tapas Bar located on the 2nd floorConcierge Service availableReduced rate parkingChildren under 13 stay free when sharing room with adult(s)Flat screen cable TV with Movies on Demand &amp; Nintendo video gamesAlarm Clock Radio (MP3 compatible) and iHome: audio system for the iPodIn-room personal safeLaundry/Valet servicesIn-room irons and ironing boardAir conditioning or heatingSingle or double roomsComplimentary newspaper weekdays (USA Today)In-room coffee makers with coffee &amp; teaInfant Cribs (available at front desk upon request)Private bathroom with Hair DryerOur top &quot;Things to See&quot; (Parents plus two boys aged 13 and 11)Central Park (&amp; the Carousel!)Natural History MuseumThe Metropolitan MuseumThe Whitney The Frick (for the Vermeer &amp; Holbein)The Intrepid Museum (fantastic aircraft carrier turned museum- well worth a visit)Nintendo World (Rockefeller Centre)Sony Lab (free tickets in the morning - go early)Ellis Island ferry - for EI museum and Statue of LibertyEmpire State Building - the City Pass cuts down a 2 hour wait outside before the 1 hour wait for the lifts!)View from the RockRock and Roll Museum on Spring Street after a pizza at LombardisGround Zero - not everything is a Spiderman gameCentury 21 for discounted trainers (huge discount department store - close to GZ)Chrysler BuildingSerendipity for the largest ice creams ever seenI'd also recommend a City Pass (you can buy on line) to dispense with queues - though if you're travelling on a budget, be aware that some museums do not charge for children and some ask only for a contribution - so you have to make sure that you will see enough sights to make the pass worthwhile. And just walk and walk and walk.....!!!"
104,1935,"Apr 17 2009	quite a deal and good location	My father and I stayed April 13-15, 2009 and had a great stay. I was a bit nervous booking on the internet. There were old and new pictures posted, but everything has been renovated. The room was clean, spacious for a large city and the location was great. We had a two queen room and it was exactly like the pictures on the hotel site. We were only two blocks from Times Square and only a few blocks from many other NYC sights. The staff was nice. The wireless internet was a bit slow, but free so no complaints. The lobby hotel internet seemed to have a lot of problems, but I had enough luck printing our boarding passes for our flight back. We thought there was a Tapas restaurant on the second floor, but it turns out it's just a little bar (we didn't try it). The breakfast was great. We felt clean, safe, and like we got a deal. I would definitely recommend it."
105,1935,"Apr 17 2009 	Average	It has comfort of being in main area of the manhatten city and close to times square.It's small but neat room, free internet wireless facility with morning breakfast &amp; gym.Little congested.but still good option for one who want to stay in the heart of the city and travelling for business or leisure.Location is just perfect.Jet Previlage Membership No. [--]"
106,1935,"Apr 11 2009 	Clean spartan quirky	Stayed April 8-10 in a &quot;family suite&quot; of two rooms with two beds and two TVs, no refrigerator. Very clean, quiet and comfortable. Others have noted the etched glass on the bathroom door. We solved that by taping some newspaper over it. The renovations others complained of seem to be done, at least in lobby and lower floors. Although clean and with new furnishings and carpet in rooms and lobby, it's an old building with oddities such as hallway doors separating adjoining elevators, some uneven stairsteps, and an unexplainable floodlight that goes on and off erratically in the airshaft (which was our only view). The bar on the second floor is little more than two small connecting hotel rooms. There are two free computers in the lobby but seemed to be a lot of competition for them. The free breakfast until 10 a.m. was well-stocked and convenient. The location is terrific, and the value is great (we paid $177 each night). Be sure to check out on time, though. We got a call at 12:25 p.m. warning us that we'd be charged another $25 if we didn't come down and check out immediately. Via Italiana and Ipanema on the same block were very good, modestly priced restaurants."
107,1935,Apr 10 2009 	Great hotel at a very reasonable price	The Hotel at Times Square was in a great location (2 blocks from the heart of Times Square) yet was not as noisy as some of the Times Square hotels can be. The continental breakfast was ample and the hotel rate was very reasonable for a hotel in that part of town.
108,1935,"Apr 7 2009 	Great value 	Paying for a US hotel in NZ dollars is scary! We wanted a good hotel in a handy location - without paying through the nose - and spent ages looking for one before settling on The Hotel at Times Square.We could not have asked for a better location - it was handy to the subway which provided easy access to all the attractions we wanted to visit that were not within walking distance. While the room was small, it had been recently redecorated and was nicely appointed.The best thing about the hotel is that breakfast is included in the rate. I calculated this saved us something like NZ$250 over the course of a week. It is not a flash meal, but the bagels were good and set us up for the day.There are two computer terminals in reception with free internet access for guests.The only things I would comment less positively about are: 1 the lifts are old fashioned and you have to wait ages.2 the breakfast room was unbearably hot at times.3 in our room the door to the bathroom was glass - although it was frosted, it might be be too much information for some people!There is no fridge in the room, so if you want tea or coffee, you are really limited to black coffee.I scoured all the travel &amp; accommodation booking sites, and got the best deal through easytobook.com - it was considerably cheaper than booking with the hotel directly.All in all, a great deal and we were thrilled with our visit to the Big Apple."
109,1935,"Apr 4 2009	Excellent stay for the money!	Visited March 23 - March 28th. The price was right! The room with two double beds was large, quiet, well maintained and clean. No view, but wasn't in the room long enough to miss a view. The computers were up and running the day I needed to print boarding passes. The free wireless connection for our laptop was wonderful to have in our rooms to help plan our excursions. We leisurely made it down to breakfast, a little later each morning, but always found plenty of fresh pastries and fruit, coffee, cereal and yogurt and a table. I was impressed with how clean the breakfast room was no matter how late we arrived. Never waited for elevators because the stairs were next to the elevators, open and well lighted (in other words safe and not hidden away) and easy to take as well as a good way to work off extra calories. I was happy that the hotel was not in the middle of Times Squares (even though Times Square is in the name of the hotel). I felt very safe and comfortable in our location for this mother /daughter trip. Only needed to take subway for our Central Park stroll, Ellis Island visit, Century 21 shopping trip, and Greenwich Village stroll. It was so convenient to walk everywhere else. It was hard to believe this is a budget hotel. If pressed for concerns: There was one large high school group who were a bit loud the few times we ran into them (where were the chaperons?). I hope this lovely budget hotel does not become a haven for touring high school groups! Can't say that the concierge services were what I considered true concierge services, but didn't really care because we had a laptop in our room and with free wireless connections had trip advisor, hopstop.com, restaurant reviews etc. Everything we needed and no waiting. Overall the hotel was far better than what I expected for a budget hotel in NYC. I am sure the economy and time of year of our visit had a lot to do with the rates, but I did a lot of comparison shopping in preparation for this trip. Based on location, free wireless, free breakfast, room size, double beds and cleanliness, I know we got a great bargain. It really made it appear that our very budget conscious mother/daughter trip wasn't so budget conscious. Much gratitude for all of the advice and suggestions I found on Trip Advisor."
110,1935,"Apr 1 2009 	was a bit dusty but great	yes there was work going on in the lobby but in our rooms or in the cute tiny bar you couldnt hear a thing, we had 2 rooms booked no problem with either, bathrooms we had had a warpped design in the glass so you could not see straight through, location was brilliant, some nice little delis and bars up the road near the comfort inn and left of the hotel you are a minute to 5 ave, i always stay in 4 or 5 star hotels but as there was so many i had to go for somewhere cheaper, glad i did i really like this hotel and will def be back"
111,1935,"Mar 25 2009	Pleasant	Problems with the heating that never were resolved. Flood lights directed right into our room, kept the room very bright all night. Still not quite sure if I understand why the hotel would put see-through glass on the bathroom doors, kind of creepy. Was told a week before we stayed that the renovations would be done in about a week. When we got there, we were told the renovations would be done in about a week. Must be the standard response. The staff did seem very friendly. The breakfast was very nice and fresh. Rooms were very clean except the dirty windows. Nice location."
112,1935,"Mar 25 2009 	Very good: location cleannes comfortable!	This hotel exceeded our expectations. We paid an excelent price, around 140 dollars per night.The location is excellent, near Times Square, Rockfeller Center and close to almost every subway line you can think of. The room is very nice, quite comfortable, everything new and very clean. The breakfast has doughnuts, bagels, juice, coffe, etc. It's very crowded and since there are so many places to eat nearby we often end up eating out. Service was good. The hotel was going through some renovations and sometimes there was only one elevator functioning which was a little bit disturbing, but it seems that these renovations will be very good for the hotel.I recommend it to anyone looking for a good budget hotel in a excelent location."
113,1935,"Mar 18 2009 	Good hotel - will be better after renovations are done!	I stayed here with my husband from March 11 - 17, 2009. The rooms are newly renovated (flat screen TV, wifi, cordless phones, clean) and fairly spacious for NYC, I think. I was disappointed that the advertised business center was not available due to renovations in the main lobby, but this should be fixed within a week or so, I would guess. I was able to go one block west to a sister hotel and use their business center, but that was not especially convenient.The breakfast was nice, nothing fancy or special but a free breakfast to get the day started is always great in my opinion. The location was good, although really not &quot;at times square&quot;... a few blocks away. Walking distance to central park, 5th ave, rockefellar center, times square. I think for my next trip, for variety, I would stay in another area (maybe Greenwich Village or Tribeca - a more 'neighbourhoody' area) but for my first trip to NYC I thought this hotel was just fine, and I got it for $109/night, which I think is a steal! The renos in the lobby were nearing completion when I left on March 17 (through the St Patrick's day parade, literally outside the front door... crazy!) and I think it will look very nice when finished. A great find if you want to stay in Midtown. Not as close to the subway as some other options, but as long as the weather is nice, the walk is a nice one."
114,1935,"Mar 11 2009 	Centrally located friendly staff good breakfast.	Beds were very comfortable, very clean room with good quality sundries, walking distance to Times Square, restaurants, and subway."
115,1935,"Mar 7 2009 	Clean clean great service and value!	This hotel is run by Applecore hotels. We stayed at the Comfort Inn Times Square last time. This hotel is spotless, great value, location etc etc. The breakfast is a bonus. Staff are fantastic. In reality it's closer to Rockefeller Center then it is to Times Square but it's definatly walkable distance to both as well as almost any midtown venue."
116,1935,"Mar 5 2009 	Great location great value clean comfortable	Trinidad, Feb 24th to 26th Check in/Check out was quick and easy, no problems with our reservation. The room looked fresh, not run down, bathroom was very clean. Location was superb, just a short walk away from Times Square, Broadway and all the other hot spots. It was so easy to pop back in for a rest after walking and shopping all day and before going out for a show. We actually dropped packages off a few times during the day rather than walking around with them. Heating was great, was actually a bit warm sometimes but much welcomed after being out in the cold, and there was always a good supply of hot water for showers. What was commendable was that when we got to the room the sink was not draining properly, we did not report it that day as we were eager to get out on the town, however, it seems that when the maids came to clean the following day, they got it fixed without us asking. That was nice. The ongoing renovations were a bit inconvenient as they often closed off one of the lifts, but we never had to wait too long for the one that was working. Breakfast was decent, loved the coffee maker in the room as I must have a cup as soon as I wake up. Overall I would definitely stay here again, as it provided a safe, clean, convenient and comfortable place to sleep after a day/night in the city."
117,1935,Mar 4 2009 	Forgetting the basics	The rooms are a decent size and comfortable enough. Good value for the location.But the website forgets to mention that the whole ground floor (1st floor to some readers!) is under renovation and it is a noisy building site.Reception is neither friendly or welcoming. Maybe they are fed up with the noise and dust.The single elevator is dirty; probably from the building.To get to breakfast you have to walk through the buidling site and the workers. I think a single female guest would be a little concerned; not unsafe just the subject of unnecessary attention.I think the failure to mention the renovations reflects the attitude towards the hotel's guests. Complacent.. I will stay somewhere else next time.
118,1935,"Feb 26 2009 	Great value and fantastic location	If you are looking for a good value hotel in a great location then this is the one. The room was very comfortable and clean. The complimentary breakfast was excellent - bagels, cereal, juice, fruit, tea and coffee and plenty of it. The desk staff were polite and helpful at all times. We had a problem with the heating and it was fixed almost immediately. We asked for more pillows and they were brought up promptly. The location is superb - close to everything. The windows are rather dirty but that is the only thing I could find to fault this hotel. I intend to return again next year."
119,1935,"Feb 24 2009 	a wonderful place to stay .	we stayed here from 18th Feb, checked out 22nd Feb , would highly reccomend it , even though renovations were in progress they did not disturb us, another aspect for me was the way you had a choice of a smoking room, very central to all , pleasant staff and a more than ample breakfast ."
120,1935,"Feb 23 2009 	Great Location Great Price Clean Rooms Great Value for Money	I stayed at the hotel from Feb 15-19, and checked out on Feb 20. Got a room (with one Queen size bed) on the 11th floor. Experience was generally pleasant. The location was great - near Times Square and many places to eat nearby. Room was comfortable and clean. However, the heater in the room worked on and off. Internet access was also very choppy, and went down very regularly. I was there for a business trip and therefore used the room for just basic accommodation, nothing more. Just one incident upon checkout that the management should work to address with the staff: I checked out at 8am plus and asked the front desk staff if she can help me call a taxi. She said that the concierge usually does it but the concierge staff had not arrived yet. Therefore, I had to flag the cab outside myself. Surely, the front desk staff there can dial for a cab using any phone line and not have to re-direct me to the absent concierge desk? I thought that this was very basic service, even for a budget hotel. Flagging a taxi is really no big deal for me but bear in mind that I am a foreigner who was hoping to get some help and it was also freezing cold outside. For the price range, I'd say it is very good value for money, but visitors must manage their expectations and should not expect 5 star comfort and service. I would have given a '4' rating if not for the checkout incident. Otherwise, it's worth the money."
121,1935,"Feb 20 2009 	Fine accomodation	Stayed between the 11 and 18 of Feb. We had a room on 12 floor, and it was great. Clean, comfy, lots of hot water and clean towels every day. The room had an ipod player and a very large flat screen TV.Wireless didn't work over the weekend. Reported it but took untill mon/tue to be fixedThe lobby is undergoing renovations - at times it was very noisy and dusty which is something to keep in mind if you're planning on staying there in the next month. But not too much trouble as you are only passing through the lobby.Breakfast was fine the one occasion I had it - but I didn't come to the US to eat Continental breakfast ;-) On offer was bagels, toast, porridge/flakes, donuts, juice, fruit and yoghurt.Only let down was that I had arranged to have a parcel shipped to the hotel to save me international shipping charges. The front desk staff knew I was expecting it, yet by 1800H Weds when I left the hotel I was assured it hadn't arrived. Yet upon returning home I find out the parcel had been delivered at 1521H that day and it had been refused by the hotel.Not very good at all, now I'll have to pay an awfull lot in shipping and import tax beacuse of someones incompetance."
122,1935,"Feb 13 2009 	Great Value in the best location!	This hotel was a lucky suprise. After splurging on 5 star hotels, we wanted a cheap hotel for our last stop - and boy was this place worth the money.The location alone was worth the price! 5-10mins walk to 5th ave, times sq, bryant park, and the subway station, rockefeller center, and the public library. It was awesome! There are some great Irish pubs within 2 blocks, and all the fast food you could need surrounding you, plus great shopping up the rd on 5th, and the TKTS theatre booth on the same street at times sq.The hotel itself is cozy, and the rooms are small, but thats to be expected with NYC hotel rooms. The lobby staff were very friendly, and there are 2 computers in the lobby with internet, but they were horrible to use. Very slow, and riddled with viruses.The room was clean, but the bathroom was average. Nothing grose, but passable. The toilet had flushing problems, but the staff came up and fixed that within 10 mins. The same maintenence guy was lovely enough to fix our damaged suitcase, going so far as to go downstairs and get the right tools and come back up to fix it.The compliemntary breakfast was ok. You cant really complain because its free, but there was no place to sit, so we just took the food back upstairs to our room. A tip would be to use the tray in your room and take that downstairs to load, because its tricky carrying everything up.The lifts were fine for such an old building, and you never had to wait long for them.The construction work was going on next door, but didnt bother me at all. I slept right through it.For the amount of money we paid for the room, it was well worth it. Id stay here again because of the location and staff."
123,1935,"Feb 3 2009 	Great finding at a great location!	The main thing about this hotel is its location: close to the Times Square and the theaters, the 5th avenue and the Rockfeller Center. The rates were quite good (considering NY prices) for the rooms, which had good furniture and were well cleaned and kept. On the other hand, the room we stayed could be a little larger, but I believe it's too much to ask in NY."
124,1935,"Feb 1 2009	Good hotel for the price	Stayed here for 5 nights in January 2009. Had a two double bedded room on 10th floor looking out sort of sideways onto a rather large hole in the ground building site next door.The room was clean and comfortable, although a bit on the small size, but I wasn't in New York to spend hours in my room.There was noise from the building site or maybe from the refurbishment at 11 pm one night. but mostly it was daytime and not too early in the morning.Breakfast is included in the rate and makes this hotel good value for money and includes - bread rolls, toast (make your own), bagels, iced donuts, jam, three types of cereal, butter, cream cheese, apples, bananas, orange juice, apple juice, tea, coffee and milk. The downside of all this lovely food is that the breakfast area is being refurbished and if you are lucky enough to get one of the few tables and chairs it is great - we managed this twice, otherwise you just take what you want and eat it sitting on the sofas at the other end of reception, which when we were there was a bit cold (outside temperatures were 15 degrees F or if you are a Brit then it was in the minuses) and the automatic doors keep opening and shutting.If you have your own computer or other wireless device, then you can use the free wireless internet anywhere in the hotel, including your room, otherwise there are two computers in the reception area with free internet access, although they weren't the most new or reliable, usually there was at least one of them working so you weren't cut off from the internet. The location is great, just over a block from the centre of Times Square. 46th Street comes out just by the TKS booth. I'd probably call it The Hotel near Times Square and not at."
125,1935,"Jan 29 2009 	So perfect	We changed to The hotel at times square, after a horrible night at The Pod-hotel. I spent the whole night surfing for a good price and a good hotel. I decided to try this, and got really good rates from their own website. I reserved a King- room, for a little compensation of the horrible last night.We arrived at the hotel before check-in time, and a nice piccolo came and took our bags to the storage room. The lobby was simple but classy. The check-in went well, and we were directed to our room at the 4th floor. The room was really clean and tidy, the toilet had been sanitized and had a seal on it. The whole room had a really clean scent on it. Our bed was huge, and pretty soft. The room was equipped with a coffe maker, and all sorts of nice stuff. The street was silent, but on a great location, just a few blocks away from Times Square.I needed to print a car rent voucher, they didn't have a printer at the hotel, but I got directed to the comfort inn, just half a block away. There I got to print my paperwork. It was a bit cold in the room at first, but after contacting the reception, a maintaince guy came up and made his tricks on the warmer. After that, the temperature was great. So we really loved it, clean, silent and classy. No screaming youngsters in the corridor, or other distractions.There were two things we were a little bit confused about. The houskeeper, seemed to be a bit too enthusiastic about cleaning our room, she came into the room two times without knocking, and on the other time we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot;-sign hanging on our door. It was a bit annoying.The other thing concerned phone calls from the room. We are from Finland, and I tought I'll call the reception for prices. They told me, that the price would be around 70snt per minute. And I tought it much cheaper than with my cell, so I used the phone to call my family. After check-out I took a better look at the receipt, and noticed that we had been charged around 2usd per minute. I asked from the receptionist, but he had some bad excuse. I agreed on it, as we were in a hurry to the airport.Summasumarum, I would, and propably will stay here again in the summer. Great pleace!"
126,1935,"Jan 18 2009 	Great Location shame about the smoking room.	This hotel is very conveniently located for Times Square and Fifth Avenue. Lots of things right on the doorstep so cannot fault anything there. On arrival in our room it didn't take long to realise we were in a smoking corridor. We were so shattered we just went to bed but all the bed linen etc had a stale smokey smell. We should've have asked to move but weren't really planning to be in the hotel that much. The hotel staff were mostly friendly until we didn't have any hot water. The front desk first of all told us to leave it running for 5 minutes or so and after 10 mins I called back, only be told to leave it running for 15-20 mins! Not very convenient when there was so much shopping to be done!! This happened three times during our stay so did become a little tiresome and the staff were not very helpful. The breakfast was plentiful but as a previous reviewer said, not many places to eat it due to the current refurb. All in all, good value for money but would not stay here again."
127,1935,"Jan 16 2009 	Staying here is so stress free	We stayed here about 3 years ago and it was a pleasant experience. So we went back last year and it was better. This year our stay was delightful again. Very clean, quiet room and comfortable beds. Hot, multi-head shower. Nice common areas, and perhaps most important, incredibly pleasant and helpful staff. The area is very safe and there's a lovely park right across the street. The complimentary breakfast includes fresh fruit, delicious coffee, juice, yogurt, bagels, and more. I wish we could visit NYC more often so we could stay here more often! We think this is the nicest hotel for an unbelievably reasonable cost."
128,1935,"Jan 12 2009 	Clean and location	Very close to Times Square. very clean rooms and bathroom. the decor in the lobby is a bit outdated but dont let that fool you. the rooms are a good size and the location is perfect. the only problem is that the bfast room is being modernised so bfast had to be eaten mostly standing up as there were only a couple of tables and chairs available. Apart from the bfast seating, I have no complaints whatsoever. we paid $144.99 for two people each night for ny thats not bad. the most important thing is that the bedroom was immaculate."
129,1935,"Jan 12 2009 	A + ...LocationClean comfortable and friendly	Celebrated our 40th anniversary with a very fun trip to NYC. The location was perfect for walking all Midtown..(check out charming Bryant Park and the NYC Library),and subway was right there for farther trips...including to and from LGA ! Our room was large and clean,bed very comfy and staff regularly asked us if everything was OK......a very generous continental BKFST started us every AM. We walked to Del Frisco's for a great steak dinner with an awesome view! It is obvious this hotel tries to please...Thank you for a great visit to this wonderful city!!!"
130,1935,"Jan 11 2009 	great rooms great price	A fellow friend and I stayed here booking a room with 2 double beds. The room was fantastic, kept very clean by housekeeping and the free breakfast was ample, the only downside to a fantastic stay was the front desk whom we likened to Fawlty Towers. It seemed that no one had a clue. We did however only find this amusing and added to the charm. Our rooms were thoroughly modern, very comfortable beds and yes as in other reviews the breakfast room is small but they are in the process of updating and they provide a great service and at no time did we see it as an inconvenience. Location was excellent and so handy to everything."
131,1935,"Jan 7 2009 	Perfect Hotel for a Family on a Budget	We needed an affordable place close to Times Square to take our family of eight (almost all teenagers). This hotel was incredibly convenient, clean, newly remodeled, and they were very accomodating. We needed to pull in an extra rollaway bed and it was much nicer than we expected. The room we stayed in was large, and the beds very comfortable. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. With only a 5 minute walk you are in the heart of the city. Don't be scared by the outside..the inside is great."
132,1935,"Dec 29 2008 	Great place to stay in NYC	We stayed at the Hotel at Times Square for a week from November 15 to the 22. My husband was travelling on business, and I accompanied him. The location was great, just a couple of blocks from Times Square, and within walking distance of everything I wanted to do in Midtown. I even walked to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in about 35-40 minutes (I am a fast walker). The room was completely acceptable, and although small, it was well laid out. We unpacked, put our suitcases in the closet, and the room was not cluttered at all for the entire week. When I made the reservation, I told the clerk we would be staying a week and he said he would note that and try to give us a bigger room, but I don't know if that was actually the case. We arrived at the hotel before noon and were able to check in right away. I would say the room was recently renovated and given a facelift, and it looked very modern. It had wireless Internet access which we had no problems with, and was necessary as this was a business trip. The only problem we had was the window was a bit drafty, and I thought there were too many long black hairs on the towels. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine as I have a hair aversion, but I thought thick, coarse, black hairs were visible enough to be removed. The bathroom floor was heated, but we are not sure if that was by design or chance, in any case it was a nice touch. I think we stayed in room 604 (?) and the pipes were really noisy at times. It seemed like when the heat was on it was a bit less noticiable, but if you are a light sleeper it will definately wake you. I told the front desk about it and they offered to move us to another room, and had someone look at it (so maybe they fixed it). We chose not to move for our own convenience, and it was absolutely no reflection on the hotel staff, but it did seem less noticable for the last few days of the stay. The continental breakfast was a very nice touch, and had more than I needed for breakfast, yogurt, toast, cereal, doughnuts, all the usuals. It was clean and tidy and had an attendant at all times. We paid about $160 plus taxes for the room per night, which I thought was well worth it, especially for NYC. This is my third trip to NYC, and I would definately return to this hotel. If you are not looking for luxury, but a clean, standard hotel to base your days activities, this is it. The staff were extremely pleasant and we had no issues with the hotel at all. The bed was really comfortable, which is a big plus in my books!!!! Plus it has an ipod docking station which I thought was a really nice touch. It had some amenties of a higher end hotel at a budget hotel price. I am Canadian and usually stay at Delta hotels, I would put this more in the Comfort Inn line, but certainly at the higher end of this. We ate at a great Brazillian restaurant nearby, plus Burger Joint in the Parker Meridian, Keen's and Joe's Shanghai, all great spots. Definately stay at the Hotel at Times Square. Great hotel, great location."
133,1935,"Dec 25 2008 	Perfect location	Location, Location, Location. Only a block and a half from Times Square action. If you want to be near Times Square, this is your place. Don't judge this book by it's cover. This is a New York City version of a good Hampton Inn or HI Express. The facade is covered with scaffolding and it has a temporary sign. It's clean, modernized, and no doorman to tip! We stayed at this hotel the weekend before Christmas. We knew NYC tourism was down due to the economy and were thinking this was the year to go if there ever was one. We made the reservation just a week before departure and with taxes it cost about $179 USD per night. We arrived Friday morning and were surprised that our room was immediately available. (unheard of during the NYC holidays). Our room (821) had two double beds and two spacious closets. By NYC standards the rooms were adequate size. The TV reception was not great on our flat screen but I fiddled with the cable and it worked acceptably well. The bathroom lacks an exhaust fan (normal for an old building). The bathroom had a &quot;sour rag&quot; odor. Complimentary in room safe.Some other reviews have complained about the slow elevators but our waits were fine. As other reviews stated, the weakest area of service is the continental breakfast. It is more crowded than Times Square on New Years Eve. Supposedly, they are renovating the breakfast area so the breakfast is served in the small lobby. We had to keep reminding ourselves that it was &quot;free&quot;. By eating there it probably saved our family of four $25-30 per day at NYC prices. There is a McDonalds around the block and several small Brazilian and Italian restaurants nearby."
134,1935,"Dec 22 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location Great Price	We stayed at the Hotel at Times Square the weekend before Christmas (when most hotels in NYC were mad expensive) for a great rate. Booking on the hotel's website was easy. We arrived at Grand Central Station and took a 5 minute taxi ride to the hotel - the location is GREAT. 5 minutes walk to Rockefeller Plaza, a little more to Times Square, and central park is not far off either. There are subway stops close by, and getting a taxi is no problem (the staff were helpful and they gladly got us a cab).The hotel itself is also great. The lobby looks to be newly renovated. Everything is quite classy, especially for a lower priced hotel. The rooms are well designed - pretty modern, something you don't find often in cheaper hotels - and all the furniture seemed to be new. The flat screen TV was hot, and an iHome ipod dock/radio sat on the dresser. Pretty nice for $150 a night!The room was spotless and in perfect order. Everything was clean, looked like we were the first people to stay in the room, something I can not say for some other hotels I've stayed in for similar prices.Nothing about the hotel could have been better. The room was smaller than I'd expected, but only by a little, and was no problem at all. I'd recommend the Hotel at Times Square to a couple on a weekend trip, to a family of four, and anyone in between. Definitely a good find."
135,1935,"Dec 18 2008 	Location Location Location	Four of us stayed here Dec. 4th - Dec. 8th. We checked in early and was able to get our room. Had a late flight on Monday and put our luggage in storage. Everything was clean, room big especially for NYC. Bathroom nice size and kept clean our entire stay. Breakfast was sufficient but temporary site is very very small. Anytime we needed anything from hotel staff they quickly met our requests. Only draw back was language barrier with some front desk employees. Very safe tourist area and easy walk to times square or Rockefeller and even 5th street shopping!"
136,1935,"Dec 15 2008 	Quaint with good location	We just returned from a night's stay at &quot;The Hotel at Times Square&quot;. While, at first, you will notice obvious external renovations being performed, it does not hurt your stay in any way (mind you, this was a Saturday evening stay, so perhaps they weren't working at this time). This is the epitome of a quaint, European-stype boutique hotel. We came to New York to take in a show and the &quot;holiday energy&quot; of the city, so did not stay for long in the room. However, the location truly helped us enjoy every part of the city that we wanted to encounter -- from Broadway to Rockefeller Plaza and even a Paul McCartney sighting. While in the room, we found it cozy and comfortable. The TV was large, the free Wi-Fi was highly useful, the bed was clean and restful. For a young couple, the size of the room was fine -- not sure how families would do, but this was definitely meant for 2 people to use, and we found it more than sufficient. If you're looking for wide, open spaces, find a bigger, pricier place. If you're looking for a stylish place to lay your hat, try The Hotel at Times Square.The only complaint I had concerned parking; had a difficult time finding the correct parking garage to take advantage of the discount, so ended up paying an arm, a leg, and another leg at a different place. Clarification on that would be helpful. Otherwise, a joy. Front desk was very helpful, albeit a little difficult to understand."
137,1935,"Dec 14 2008 	GREAT DEAL - GREAT LOCATION - GREAT STAFF	I moved to The Hotel At Times Square after two nights at the Hilton Times Square... and I was not disappointed at all !Sure, at the Hitlon i could see the Empire State Building from my window at the 42nd floor... but believe me, if you are planning to spend your time in NYC just looking out of the window, I do guess there is something wrong with you! LOLBeing serious now. The location is great: just across the street from Times Square: you can truly reach it in less than 5 minutes walking.5th Avenue is at the end of the street; on the other side, you have 6th Avenue.This means that you reach the most popular attractions in a few minutes: shopping of 5th Avenue (Saks, Cartier, Tiffany and everything else), Rockfeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, BB King Club, Mme Tussaud and so on.The street is safe, and let me tell you that I stayed there alone - I am a young woman, and used to go out in the night too. I have never had a problem.From there, you can easily get a cab any time (day and night), or you can reach the subway in just a few steps (less than 5 minutes). if you like the bus, you can also jump on it: it is just at the end of the street (5th Avenue).The buildings around are not that gorgeus, but it is not a big deal, because the most beautiful architecture masterpieces of NYC are at a close distance.In the street, you can also find a &quot;Monster Sushi&quot;: if you like miso soup and sushi-sashimi-maki, you will find it really exciting, and not expensive at all.And now the hotel: it is quite small, familiar and simple, with a small lounge with wooden walls and leather couches. The stairs are amazing, they look so old fashioned but at the same time they have clearly been renewed lately.The rooms are exactly the way the look in the pictures in the applecore site: the main colour is green, and the furniture is new.The bath has a reasonsable size, just don't forget to bring (or buy) your own shower cap, because they don't give that.Most important thing: rooms are perfectly clean, and they have 2 locks.The hotel is ver peaceful, anyway: perfectly safe even for a single girl.The staff is absolutely great: they are always so nice and willing to help, available at any time, no matter how obnoxious you can be!!The only problem is the noise, because windows are not soundproof: I had to use earplugs in order to be able to sleep. I don't think that the position of the room can make a real difference.What else can i say? I loved the hotel, the staff and the location: definitely i did not regret Hilton, where the price of one single night was higher than 3 nights at the Applecore.Great deal, great stay."
138,1935,"Dec 13 2008 	Pleasantly surprised!!!	We stayed at this hotel from December 9 - 11th and had a wonderful time! Coming from two nights (business) at the Waldorf, we were a little nervous about staying at this hotel. The outside is nothing special (they are renovating), but we were pleasantly surprised at the room and the value for the location! Most hotels in this area run for about $300.00+, but we were able to get this room from the hotel website for under $200.00 a night. The room is small but VERY clean!! The only &quot;negative&quot; (it's a small one) was the pillows. They were flat and not terribly comfortable. The location is terrific! Two blocks from Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc. Great location!!!! We would definitely stay here again!!!"
139,1935,"Dec 12 2008 	Great location minimal service	This hotel is in a great location for access to the theatre district. The rooms are a good size for New York City. The bathroom is descent and clean. The bed sheets are pilled, which makes them a bit uncomfortable. There is a nice bistro on 44th - db Bistro Moderne. There is a McDonalds and Subway close by as well. There are little to no services available, for example, no concierge. Even ordering extra pillows took 3 calls and 2 days. Breakfast was adequate, some fruit, pastries, coffee, orange juice, but ran out of food early. Arrive near the 7 am start or there won't be any food left!"
140,1935,"Dec 11 2008 	Great Hotel - Excellent location	Like a lot of people I didnt know what to expect having read all the reviews about this hotel. My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights and thought the hotel was excellent. Its nothing fancy but the room was big, warm and very clean. The beds &amp; towels were changed every day. Bathroom is very large too with a great shower. The location is the best thing about this hotel. Its on 46th street between 5th &amp; 6th avenue which is a great midtown location. We walked all over Manhattan, youre only a few blocks from Times Square, the Rockefeller centre, St. Patricks Cathedral, The Empire State building, etc. Yes the breakfast isnt up to much but youre in the middle of Manhattan, you wont be short of places to eat. There are two computers in the lobby with internet access and there was often a queue for these but the room had wi-fi access so if I bothered to bring my laptop there wouldnt have been a problem.I would definitely stay here if I come back to NYC, which Im sure I will. Its a bit hard to spot from outside as with the building work going on next door there is only a banner over the front door. One tip is keep an eye on the website as you will often get a good late availability deal. I had this hotel booked months ago, noticed it was much cheaper a few weeks before I travelled so I cancelled the reservation and booked it again and saved hundreds of dollars."
141,1935,"Dec 9 2008 	Clean great value and location	Booked online for 4 days the first week of December. Hotel is in a great location (46th st. between 5th and 6th avenues). The hotel is very close to Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller Center etc. The rooms appear newly renovated and updated. The exterior of the hotel is still undergoing renovations, but this did not negatively impact our experience at all.We arrived at 1100am so no room was available but our luggage was stored (free) and we went out for brunch. We were told the room would be ready at 1:30pm (even though check-in is not technically until 3:00pm).Loved the room! Nice decor,spotlessly clean, modern bathroom (with an unusual glass door), and beds were comfortable. Plenty of lights and a great IPOD dock on the clock radio. Interior room so no view unless you count the fire escape but trade off was the absolute quiet. Breakfast room was extremely crowded, but some food was always available. Front desk and housekeeping staff were very helpful.Totally satisfying experience. Great value for price paid."
142,1935,"Nov 28 2008 	Big disapointing	When I found this hotel I was so happy that you still can find something on a good price in a good place.But when we checked in,the guy from the front desk told me that we have a reservation for two rooms.I said that I don't need two rooms and he said&quot;ok&quot;.When a sow him next time,he told me just like that ,that everything is ok,but they charged me for the room.After one hour discution ,that this is some sistem mistake,and after he print me some papers ,(that can not be prove,coz the confirmation number in that papers and this that I have in my e-mail were competely diferent.) he told me that this is the internet reservation and he can not do anything,I have to talk with the menager.When I went back to my room I try to call to the internet company on the phone that i found in the web site.Infortunately when I dialed this number I spoke again with the guy from the front desk???After couple days I found the menager,she told me that she will check and she will call me ,but she never did.So I found her finaly,but nothing.She just said ,&quot;sorry&quot;You gave your credit card,so you give a permition for charge.That's it,I paid for two rooms in this hotel,but they never gave me second room,by the way,may be they gave this room to somebody else.I hope that they not gonna charge me some they again,but i will never go again in this hotel.If you think that the room cost 180$,noo it cost at about 370$ nightly."
143,1935,"Nov 24 2008	No heating? Here's a blanket	Good quality hotel, fantastic location. However, my stay was ruined by:a. The maids who knock on your doors everyday at 9 or 10 in the morning and check to see if you have vacated your room every 15 minutes or so. Found this v annoying. They have no idea of a lie in, esp on weekends.b. The heating, which broke down. I called reception to get it fixed and heard nothing for 30 minutes. After over an hour of constant chasing (since reception did not seem to consider it an urgent matter), someone eventually showed with a blanket - since they had apparently run out of portable heaters that night! No apology or explanation offered, absolutely pathetic!c. The TV was not working for 2 days.Stay by all means, it's good value for money, but if anything goes wrong, don't expect anything."
144,1935,"Nov 21 2008 	Decent and good value for money	There is nothing wrong with this neat, clean and comfortable hotel, it might be a bit tired and run down in and around the foyer, and the breakfast room well I really don't know why they bother, but there a loads of decent diners nearby and where it counts that is the actual room these lodgings are quite respectable. The rooms are quite large by NYC standards, the beds comfortable, good shower and decent bedding, and for US$150 per night very good value. My son and I in fact where in the family room on the 9th floor, 2 bedrooms and the accomodation large enough really for a family of 5 (if the chidlren are still small), excellent, and if you like that sort of thing there are flat screen Tv's in both the bedrooms. Anyway all up, decent, good value and the location without being spectacular is quite ok."
145,1935,"Nov 13 2008 	Coming from a 'princess'... very good.	Just returned from a my first trip to NYC with my boyfriend. Tripadvisor is our bible and I can't tell you how long we were looking for a hotel that was suitable in terms of accommodation and price.Don't ask us how we found this hotel - the price for our five night stay is what attracted us initially and then looking it up on here we thought not bad. I must admit I had my reservations about staying in a one star hotel - but was very very pleasantly suprised.The hotel itself is perfectly nice and met all of our needs - great location, friendly staff, incredibly clean with mod cons. The rooms were huge! in comparison to other hotels with tiny rooms at double the price we were laughing. large plasma on the wall, comfortable bed and a bathroom which wasnt lavish but lovely and clean and certainly met our needs and in our opinion warranted more than one star.Breakfast was fine. Small seating area and self service. This certainly wasnt 5 star catering but again was just fine with a small selection of pastries, cereal, juices and fruit etc - served on disposable plates.The only downsides I must mention are the following. Our room allbeit lovely was facing road side on the 11th floor - unfortunately this was too noisy for us and our sleep was constantly interuppted which wasnt great - we did ask to change rooms which we said we could however by the time we got our acts together the hotel sold out and we couldnt move. Also on the last night - exhausted I jumped into bed and the new undersheet (fresh bedding and towels every day) was bobbled and itchy - this however did not bother my boyfriend who said it reminded him of staying at his grandmas when he was a kid - take from that what you will!Would we stay at this hotel again? if the price was right and we were able to get a room not facing the road then probably."
146,1935,"Nov 13 2008 	Great Room Excellent Location	Just returned from a terrific 4-night stay (Thu-Sun) at The Hotel at Times Square in New York City. Booked the room through the hotel website (applecorehotels.com) and received a nightly rate of $140 which is excellent compared to others in Manhattan (Sunday night was even a little less expensive at only $120).Actually, it was more like 4 1/2 nights--I arrived around 10:00 in the morning, intending to just check bags and sightsee until the 3:00 check-in and they were nice enough to give me the room early! They even provided a complimentary goodie bag with toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, razor, Aleve, and granola bar.The room was on the top (11th) floor of the rear tower and definitely much bigger and nicer than I expected based on reading reviews of other NYC hotels. Not much of a view, but who wants to be staring out the window anyway?!? The room was very clean and seemed to have been recently remodeled. Window heater/air was a little noisy, but otherwise worked fine. Amenities included a queen-size, pillow-top mattress, iPod clock radio, flat-screen TV, and closet safe.The small elevator was slow during busy times, but that was only a minor inconvenience. There is an exercise room in the basement and a small bar on the 2nd floor. Draft beers were only $3 and some of the mixed drinks were $5. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful in providing assistance and directions.The hotel itself is located on 46th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. (The street corner sign actually says &quot;Little Brazil.&quot;) The street is one-way, so vehicles will need to approach from the 6th Street direction. There is some construction in the area, but it wasn't really a problem. This location is perfect for access to 5th Avenue shopping, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Broadway/Times Square, Grand Central Station, Bryant Park/New York Public Library, Museum of Modern Art, and Central Park. In addition, subway access is only a block or two away if you have to travel a little further than walking distance.Due to the close proximity to tourist locations, there always seemed to be pedestrian traffic nearby, so safety was never an issue when walking in the neighborhood, even late at night. For last-minute supplies, there is a Duane Reade store nearby that is open 24-hours.In summary, I would definitely recommend this location for anyone staying in midtown Manhattan."
147,1935,"Oct 30 2008 	Really Good Hotel!!!	I have to say I disagree with some of these reviews, We stayed at this hotel October 22 through October 27. I was really pleased with the hotel. We got a pretty sweet deal on the hotel. We arrived at 7:00a.m. and were allowed to an early check-in. Once we saw our room, it was more than what I expected, we got the two bedroom suite (1211). Many people on this site have complained about the elevators, honestly we had no problem whatsoever. I am from Orange County, CA, I had never been to NY. My family and I really fell in love with NY. The hotel location was perfect, just two blocks from Times Square. I will definately stay at this hotel for my next visit!!!-CHRISOC, CA"
148,1935,"Oct 28 2008 	For First time in NY This Location was Perfect! Nice Rooms Too!!	This hotel was very good from the start. Our flight from Long Beach to JFK was to arrive in NY at 5:45 am, so we were a little scared that there wasnt going to be any rooms available for early check-in. To our surprise, they checked us in right when we got there (6:30 am) and we were even upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite on the top floor. The staff there was very helpful when we had any questions. The rooms were very clean and not as small as everyone said they were. Perfect location, we were one light away from Times Square. There's a Subway (rstrnt)like 20 feet away, &amp; a Mcdonald's right around the corner. Rockefeller Center is on the next block, and so is Radio City Music Hall.Being my first time in NY and being from Orange County, CA, I expected alot. (Just cause I'm so use to the Vegas rooms) Let's just say it was all I expected. I read alot of reviews prior to my stay and some people were complaining about the loud noises at 7 am &amp; how the place was horrible....but ur on a VACATION...who cares if they wake you up that early, why do u want to sleep for 20 hrs. It was fun for us, cause since we were on a vaca, we wanted to be up as early as possible. (the construction was only going on during the week, not the weekend.) Very nice place. I would stay here again.Oh, we also got a discount as far as price. I think total for 4 nights, we paid 1291.00 as oppossed to 2000 or more at other places."
149,1935,"Oct 20 2008 	Everything we needed in a fantastic location!	We were very concerned after reading reviews on Trip Advisor that this Hotel would be awful but we really enjoyed our stay. It is expensive at about 175 a night but this location was perfect if you want to be central to everthing and we couldn't find anything to complain about. The bedroom was very clean when we arrived and was cleaned to an excellent standard everyday. It had everything you need from a Hotel room with a safe, hairdryer, towels, toiletries, ipod station, coffee machine etc and all in good working order. I would not recommend this place if you want to spend alot of time in the Hotel or if you want to experience spectacular views of the City but if you want a good standard of accomodation in a great location then this is the place for you."
150,1935,"Oct 17 2008 	The Hotel (to stay in) at Times Square	Booked online for 4 days the second week of October. Hotel is quaint 12 story in great location (46th st. between 6th and 5th avenues) , newly renovated and refreshed.  We arrived at 1000am so no room was available but our luggage was stored (free) and we went out for brunch. We were told the room would be ready at 1:00 but when we returned at noon,our 12th fl. room was ready. Loved the room! Nice decor,spotlessly clean, modern bathroom,and beds more comfortable than any I've stayed in. My husband loved the little reading lights on both sides of the bed and the IPOD dock on the clock radio. Interior room so no view unless you count the fire escape but trade off was the absolute quiet. Great for sleeping. Heard more noise in hall and adjacent room than from the street. Heard no construction noise mentioned in other reviews... Breakfast room is very busy but that changes minute by minute so it depends on your timing. Basic continental choices but something for everyone and we never saw shortages.  Staff was professional and helpful. Our last morning, at 6:30am, the concierge went out to 6th avenue and brought us back a cab for the airport.  Totally satifying experience. Great value for price paid."
151,1935,"Oct 9 2008 	Horrible Experience with Super 8 Times Square	I had to change my reservation for the following day due to a flight cancellation. It was during a holiday snow storm, flying through Denver. When I called the hotel to let them know I would be arriving late, the clerk was rude and uncooperative. I ended up having to cancel the reservation and finding a room elsewhere. I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone!"
152,1935,"Oct 8 2008 	Excellent value for money	After reading countless reviews of various economically priced hotels in NY, we opted for this one since the majority of the reviews were positive. We arrived and were promptly checked in and found our room to be modern and very clean. Other reviews have stated that the rooms are small but by European standards, the room was more than adequate. The location of the hotel is fantastic, just 5 minutes walk to Times Square and only a couple of minutes to the nearest subway station. The check out time is 12 noon but the staff were more than happy to store our luggage for us until later that day. Alternatively, there is an hourly rate for keeping the room on for late check out. Overall, we were very impressed by this hotel for the purpose we needed it for - shopping and sightseeing with a clean comfortable bed to return to at the end of the day. If I had to give 1 piece of negative feedback, it would be that the continental breakfast is extremely basic (but then it is free!). Throw away dishes/cutlery/cups are OK if you just want to grab something rather than savour that first meal of the day. Unfortunately, I witnessed the staff member servicing the kitchen area using a tea towel to wipe surfaces that I had seen him wipe the trash bin with. I meant to report it to reception staff but forgot when checking out. Apart from that, absolutely fine and would definately return if the trip was for the same purpose."
153,1935,"Sep 24 2008 	Not bad :)	We have just returned from NYC and had the best time there. We chose The Hotel at Times Square because at the time that we were planning to be in New York, hotel prices were INSANE. The Hotel at Times Square was the cheapest one we could find in such a good location at $349/night. The reviews absolutely scared me. This hotel used to be a Super 8. And most websites gave it 2 stars or less. But, when arriving to the hotel I was pleasantly surprised. I am very new to writing these reviews, so let me just go with a pro and con list...PRO:- The hotel is within a few blocks (definitely walking distance) to times square.- The rooms were clean (majorly important!)- The bed was soft- MOST of the staff were friendly- Free internet- Free continental breakfast.- 24 hour Business Center (small but adequate)- Concierge helped point out nearby food delivery places, was able to buy our theatre tickets and pick them up for us, and was able to coordinate shuttle transportation for us. CONS:- The hotel is old, so expect small and slow elevators.- The bathroom was on the small side. Some rooms seem to have a little bigger bathrooms than others.- As I mentioned earlier, the hotel is old, though the rooms are renovated, the tightness and awkwardness of the hallways and stairways show you the age of this hotel.-The internet's wireless capabilities didn't work in our room, front desk didn't have any more ethernet cables, so we were without internet the first day - The business center, breakfast room, and fitness facility are in the bottom floor of this hotel and as far as I'm concerned I was a little scared to go down there! - There's no real restaurant within the hotel itself. However, there's loads of restaurants who deliver, and concierge can give you some menus and phone numbers. - Cabs do not know this hotel so just tell them the address...and not 59 W 46th street, you have to say &quot;46 street between 5th and 6th Ave&quot; and usually they'll get it right.So, the end result...this hotel is not a four star hotel...it's old, it's small. BUT, it gets the job done. Its clean, it's near times square and radio city and build-a-bear, and all those things. Would I stay here again? If the price was right..sure. If you're a business person who needs a lot of upscale technological amenities, or if you're a person looking to be pampered on your next trip...Don't stay here.But if you someone who just needs a clean, moderately priced place to rest his head after a day in New York, then this is a good place for you."
154,1935,"Sep 19 2008 	Great Value	I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, location and courteous staff at The Hotel at Times Square. After reading many horrible reviews on other hotels we weren't sure what to expect but the lobby was well lit, well staffed and the concierge extremely helpful. Our room was very clean, beds were comfortable and amenities plentiful. Other reviews are negative on their breakfast but keep in mind it is continental, not buffet. I was happy to see fresh, unbruised fruit and plenty of pastries and breads. Subway a block and a half away, close to Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Definitely recommend."
155,1935,"Sep 18 2008 	Outstanding service and value !!	We just stayed at this hotel during the recent White Sox / Yankees series.Check in was prompt and efficient, and the desk person even put us in a suite. Really friendly. Tossed us a 'welcome kit' which was necessary as this was a last minute trip and we forgot toiletry things at home.Room was just perfect. Very clean with all the latest electronic gizmos ... flat panel, TV, iPod dock. Even a coffee maker with ample supplies,Bathroom was well lit and clean (Have to mention this in comparison to other places I've been in NYC).Great location. Terrific folks. Great place to stay !!"
156,1935,"Sep 17 2008	LocationLocationLocation!!!!!!	We headed to NY from Chicago to see our beloved White Sox take on the Yankee's. We decided to book with this Hotel mainly for the lower cost of the stay compared to the other hotels in Time's Square. I will admit I was a worried that this place was going to be a dump. When we arrived I was impressed on condition of the Hotel and two blocks from Broadway doesnt hurt either. The subway is two blocks away to head up to Yankee staduim. The Car service is very nice( prices are lower than a cab to Shea Staidum) that we took to the Mets game. Shopping is located 1 block east of the hotel on 5th ave. The room was bigger than I expected, very clean and the flat screen didnt hurt either. parking is non-existent so do not bring a car. You can walk to 90% of Times Square. There are only two negative comments I have. Do not depend on the free breakfast to fill you up......and during the week at 7am the construction start, so dont expect to sleep in. This im sure is common at any hotel though. We will be back next year to check out the new stadiums and I have alread booked my stay here......."
157,1935,"Sep 17 2008 	Excellent Budget Choice for Midtown	If the price is right (and it was when I stayed), the Times Square Hotel is an outstanding budget choice for the New York traveler. The hotel is convenient to the Theatre District, Grand Central and Midtown. The hotel has recently been redone and rooms are clean and, for the price, comfortable. My one caveat would be to check price versus other establishments before booking-- the price here varies substantially on the basis of market bookings. If it veers to $300+, you can very likely do better elsewhere. But if you are at a lower price point, it is worth it."
158,1935,"Sep 9 2008 	Great Location and VALUE!!	Wow! I just had to leave a review for this little gem. I am a seasoned traveler, and have stayed at some of the best. But for this quick Fashion Week trip, I needed to stay within a budget, so booked here. My gal pal and I could not have been happier. The location is key, we walked to the tents at Bryant Park, the Rock, Bobby Flay's restaurant (Bar Americain, good but not great), and the Gershwin Theater (the last two in the rain!) and really felt we were central to all of our 'venues'. The room is clean, looks just like the photos. Comfy bed, and plenty of towels (a pet peeve of mine is skimpy towels~these were not and there were 4 bath towels each day). NICE LG flat screen, good AC, coffee maker a plus, in-room safe easy to use.The staff let us in at NOON, and since we were early, we got a room on the 4th floor as we had heard about the slow elevators. In reality, there were only a couple of times we were impatient for the lifts, mostly it was fine.I recommend watching the website and look for falling rates. I did, and the hotel honored the everlowering rates each time I called. I saved $70 per night by this method.We skipped the breakfast buffet, and instead went to Pret - A-Manger, a Brit cafe around the corner on 6th. GREAT FOOD and COFFEE! Bring lunch back to your room and save a bundle.In short, I'll be back. I'd rather spend my money on sightseeing and shopping then a fancy hotel. My sis stayed this same week at a pricier ($500 a night) place, and it was not much of a bigger room and the plumbing was awful!!Give the place a try. I think you will be satisfied. It was a total gamble for me, but paid off!!"
159,1935,"Sep 8 2008 	Good location dark rooms very basic facilities	I spent 2 nights in this hotel.The location is perfect, very central, adjacent to Broadway etc.At best, I'd say the hotel was &quot;basic&quot; for someone who wasn't too fussy.The room and decor was uninvitingly dark. The windows were filthy and had warning signs not to open them.The hotel said there were computer games in each room, but didn't say it was $8 per hour for an old Nintendo 64 game.The breakfast was a buffet of sorts in a hall were free tables were not always available. There was a lot of construction going on within the hotel. The lifts were slow and you could be waiting a while to get one.The &quot;business lounge&quot; for internet access was at the back of the hotel in a small room, behind a storage area for construction materials. It had old and basic computers of very low spec.If you're only staying a night or two, and want a central location at the compromise of quality and comfort I suppose it's okay."
160,1935,"Aug 30 2008	Great	We would like to inform the management of the hotel on how friendly Patriciais.She was very welcoming and cleaned our room 804 superbly.In this age of busy lives, a smiling face in the service industry goes along way. I am sure that Patricia has touched the lives of many travellersand I would like to acknowledge that she made a difference to our stay atyour hotel.Jeanne Waas"
161,1935,"Aug 25 2008 	Could be better but not that bad	Positives:Good locationDecent priceReasonable rateCleanFriendly staffNegatives:No towel racks in bathroomBreakfast is a jokeTV's automatically tune to pay-per-view adult content previewsSome of mentioned cabbies not being able to find the hotel but we never let that deter us in Manhattan. In fact, I'm not sure we've ever taken a cab directly to our hotel. Part of Manhattan is walking. We just got within a few blocks and walk. Much more fun.The breakfast buffet is a complete joke. After the first morning we gave up and never went back. There are only a few tables for a busy hotel. Not worth the trouble.The most irritating thing was that whenever we returned to the room and switched the TV on it was automatically tuned to the pay-per-view channel. Not unusual for a hotel. What bothered me was that every single time the previews being shown were for the adult content. I had to make sure to change the channel quickly as it's not appropriate kids to see that kind of stuff. Especially irritating considering that they bill themselves as a family hotel.I guess the key question is will be come back? Maybe. Depending on what other deals we can find we would consider staying here again."
162,1935,"Aug 20 2008 	Great Manhattan hotel	We stayed here with our 2 young children and my mother-in-law. This hotel is excellently located just off Times Square. There is a basic but adequate complimentary breakfast. The room was extremely spacious with two comfortable beds.We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. From our experience, I would say that it represents very good value."
163,1935,"Aug 19 2008 	I wish I could be more positive	We were booked for a 4 day Shop and Stay package which was listed at $109 per night on the WEB and was to include coupons for shopping, restaurants, bottled water etc. The price and offer were listed on my reservation in the special code box. When we arrived, we were told that the $109 offer was not available in August, although it clearly stated that it was available from May through December on the WEB. We were charged $259 instead. The package materials were given to us on Day 4 and weren't available even then, in the morning before we checked our bags and checked out of our room. We were given a bag at 4 p.m. when we came back for our luggage. The bag contained gingerale instead of water, coupons for a mall outside of New York City and no restaurant coupons. I left them on a table for anyone else to use. I fought for 3 days for a discount based on all of the things that had gone wrong during our stay.Positives: Comfy bed in a fairly large for New York room, which was quiet. Coffee pot in room. Nice business center with 3 computers. When the repair people came for the TV and phone, they were professional. Good location for theatres and subway. Negatives: It took 4 hours, 2 calls and a trip to the front desk to get extra pillows. Phone was broken for 2 days which negated the supposed perk of free calls. TV reception very poor -couldn't get Channels 2-7. 3rd evening had only lukewarm water, 4th morning , only cold. Former visitor's make-up brush was found on day 4, on side of bed, when we were checking that we hadn't left anything ourselves. Breakfast was a mob scene each morning with no tables. Clerks had great difficulty with keeping up with the turnover and replenishing food. Only green bananas were available. Concierge misdirected us to the Metropolitan Museum, which you would think would be a popular spot in NYC!For the entire weekend, there were tools and tape left at the top of the stairs for anyone to trip over. Also, paper was left on the elevator floor for 2 days.On a sheet listing the hotel services given to guests at check-in, guests were asked to leave positive reviews on-line. I'm sorry that I honestly can't."
164,1935,"Aug 14 2008 	Great Location!!	This hotel was recommended to us by our neighbor. I would definitely recommend it. I had to laugh at the last review as we had the same problem finding the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised when we got there. Everyone was friendly, check in went smooth. As far as the room size it was definitely adequate. We stayed in Paris a couple of years ago and this room was twice the size. The rooms were very clean and always made up properly. The room where the continental breakfast was served was adequate and it was a mob scene but the price was right (included in cost of hotel). If you are looking for fine dining and a quiet place to have breakfast you have to pay the big bucks elsewhere. I also had to laugh at the 7am &quot;wake up call&quot; with the jackhammers next door. I guess that is the price to pay in an ever changing city. We also liked the fact that you could call on the telephone anywhere in the USA for no charge. In my family's opinion, don't let the bad reviews scare you. Go and find out for yourself. After all it is a place for you to hang your hat at night. Enjoy the city. We sure did and will be back again."
165,1935,"Aug 8 2008 	Great NYC location	First of all, our cab driver could not find the hotel so we just got out at the curb in the block it was supposed to be in. The problem was when we made our reservation, it was a Super 8 franchise. The managers are currently negotiating for a new franchise. Currently there is a canvas sign over the marquee, naming it The Hotel at Times Square.We picked this hotel due to great location--46th between 5th and 6th--and a couple positive reviews on this site after remodeling in the spring.The staff is friendly (not always the case in NYC?) and the decor is nice after the remodeling. For NYC, we thought the value was great--$209/night with our AAA discount.Two caveats--construction next door starts about 7 a.m.--may be hard to sleep in. Second--the continental breakfast is a consistent mob scene. The earlier you get down there, the better. Lots of foreign tourists due to the weak dollar.Re: the TKTS booth for same day show tickets--it is only about three blocks away but it would have been nice if the concierge had mentioned they take cash only. the lines can be long, but they move quickly. We got good seats for the play we wanted (The 39 Steps was great) at half-price.If we returned, we would defintiely consider staying there again."
166,1935,"Aug 4 2008 	Good value but beware of false advertising	This is a tough review to write. The room we stayed in was a nice room for the price, considering you are in the Times Square area. We had two double beds and a bathroom. The problem is that we booked our room through Super 8's website. And their website clearly stated that we would have a room with two double beds AND a sleeper sofa--which is important for a family of 6. When we checked in and went up to our room on the 10th floor, imagine our surprise to see only two beds and no sofa. When I went back to the front desk, I was rudely told that I was wrong about my reservation. They put me on the phone with the manager who explained that they have NEVER had rooms with two beds and a sleeper sofa. We made due with the situation and two of our boys slept on the floor with extra blankets making up their &quot;beds&quot;.Given the false advertising on Super 8's website, and rudeness of the front desk, we won't be staying here again. If you have a family of 4 or less, it is a bargain for the location."
167,1935,"Aug 1 2008 	Our stay at the Hotel at Times Square New York	We stayed at this hotel in July 2008 for 10 nights. We arrived early, but there was no problem booking in and we were given our room straight away. Our room was perfect with fresh towels and toiletries everyday. The bed was very comfortable and there was coffee/tea making facilities provided in the room. We had a complimentary self service breakfast and this included cereals, toast, cheese, doughnuts, fresh fruit, yoghurts, tea, coffee and orange juice. You could eat as much as you liked. The breakfast room could have been bigger as it was always very busy. We always managed to be seated, but some guests took their breakfast to their room. The hotel was very central for getting about and we would certainly recommend it for staying in the Mid -Town area of New York."
168,1935,"Jul 30 2008 	Basic accommodation	This hotel has basic accomodation and if you get a good price it may be value for money in a very central location. However for the price I paid I expected more. The pictures on the website are deceptive it shows a light bright large room, whereas the room i had was dark and grim and small (needed the lights on in the day time to see), this wasn't helped by very dirty windows.The room had been recently refurbished so the wallpaper etc was new however the bathroom was tiny and shabby.The experience at the hotel (end July) was not helped by the noise, the noise from the street added to by the construction going on at the side of the hotel. Given that this is currently a large hole I would anticipate that the construction site (with the sound of lorries and diggers as early as 5am) will be there for some time to come. It appeared to me that the windows are not double glazed so even on a high floor you hear all the noise. The lifts in the hotel are extremely slow and busy and not helped by congestion caused by the cleaners trolleys, but also on the day I was checking out one of the lifts was out of order so I had to wait for a lift for over 20 minutes as I could not have carried my suit case downstairs.Do not be seduced by the 'free' breakfast, this is a basic low quality buffet in the basement and is a bit of a fight for space - I gave up after the first morning and preferred to pay for decent food in pleasant surroundings.The reception staff on check in could not have been more helpful, however the lady who checked me out was extremely unpleasant she made various mistakes and seemed to be getting angry with me because of her mistakes - perhaps she was just having a bad day but I at least expected an apology at the end of the tortous exercise of checking out but non was forthcoming.To sum up I would give this hotel a miss while the contstruction is going on, I would then only consider if you need a central location but are on a tight budget and get a very cheap deal and expect to be out of the hotel room for most of the time."

4,1940,Jun 24 2009 	Delightful!	My husband and I stayed at The Lombardy because a friend recommended it. We booked a room for 2 for a whirlwind 2 day
5,1940,Jun 11 2009 	For the price of a room you get a suite. Why stsy anywhere else?	This is the only hotel I would consider staying at in NYC. Where else can you get a 900 sq.ft. suite for the $369 in the city?Although the style and furnishings of the suites vary we have not had anything other than very good suites in the last four times we have stayed.The position is excellent (you can even walk to the theatre district in about 30 minutes).Only downside is that the fan on air con in our suite was noisy if on 'high' but then I would not visit NYC in the summer anyway as it is too hot and humid then.	
6,1940,Mar 20 2009 	The Lombardy Hotel is Great!!!	I have stayed twice at the Lombardy hotel this past year. Both times the hotel has been part of making my trip a wonderful experience.The Lombardy first of all has an excellent location. It is a central
7,1940,Feb 17 2009 	Stay Away!	The room was spacious for New York. Our money was stolen from our room when the room was getting serviced $7500!! later the money automatically showed up when the police were called to investigate. Management wasnt even willing to compensate 1 cent to our make up for the our honeymoon being ruined
8,1940,Jul 22 2008	great new york stay!	We stayed at the Lombardy for 2 nights. the location is great- two blocks from tons of shopping and restaurants. the service was really good- we were upgraded to a suite!. My only complaint was that we wished the front desk was a bit more knowledgable on restaurants both in the area and outside of midtown but overall we loved staying here and plan to return. It is very reasonably priced
9,1940,Nov 11 2007	Overall one of the best places to stay in Manhattan	We are here for the second time..having stayed here for 6 weeks last year. Place is fantastic..and a real bargain..especially the monthly rates. Much depends on the room you actually get as they are all individually owned and some are nicer
10,1940,Jul 22 2007 	Excellent Hotel Nice Respite	I am in the middle of my stay at the Lombardy

1,1942,Pleasantly surprised. Excellent value.	We were very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Found out about it on Tripadvisor and wasn't dissappointed. Found the best rate on the hotel's website as the travel sites did not account for the AAA discount. Room was bigger than expected ( for NY standards) and appeared to have been renovated recently. Staff was friendly and helpful. It was not a luxury hotel by any means but extremely nice for the price. Subway was 1 block away and Central Park was about 3 blocks. Would definitely stay there again.
2,1942,"Skip if looking for luxury	Just stayed at The Lucerne over Thanksgiving. I'll make it simple: if you are used to luxury hotels and are hoping to have found an inexpensive gem on the UWS you will be sadly disappointed. If you are used to mid or low range chains, you might be pleasantly surprised. This is not a luxury hotel by any definition. And like the other choice in the neighborhood - On the Ave - it is also the permanent home to at least several long-term residents grandfathered in by NY rent control laws, so don't be surprised to smell cooking or see a small family living in a one room. In my opinion, this slice of New York life does not add character, rather it gives the hotel an air of being a flop house, highlighted by the drab, institutional hallways, cheap blankets, grimy shower curtains, unhelpful and cheerless staff, and a general sense of disease... In sum: I can not recommend for anyone who is accustomed to 4 or 5 star hotels. It is 3 stars at best, and less if you take into account the permanent resident situation."
3,1942,"Lovely hotel very comfortable great location	Beautifully restored and tastefully decorated hotel. Our standard double room with queen sized bed was spacious, comfortable and welcoming. Staff are friendly and helpful. Great location on the upper west side - a stone's throw from Central Park (and a very pleasant walk through the park to 'museum mile'). Subway downtown just a 2 minute walk. Breakfast wasn't included with the room but in retrospect we were glad as it gave us the chance to sample breakfast in a new cafe or diner on each of the 4 days of our stay - none of them more than 400 yards from our doorstep!"
4,1942,"Nov 17 2009 	Terrific Hotel can't wait to stay here again	What a pleasant surprise. We were looking for a hotel on the upper west side, as we attended a show at Lincoln Center. We visit NYC 3-5 times a year always trying different hotels. The Lucerne is a keeper. We can't wait to stay here again. The staff was attentive, the room large and elegant the area quiet. Great location for restaurants and shopping."
5,1942,"Nov 14 2009 	Good 3*	Stayed with my partner for 5 night stay. Great location in the UWS, close to the 1 subway line, with loads of nice bars and restaurants close by. Dined at Scarletta's on 77th and Columbus, and at St James Gate on 81st, both good. Manhattan Diner and Cafe 82 also good for breakfast on Broadway.Hotel staff very pleasant, and accommodation was very, very tidy. However, room (#1201) was very small. We booked on a late deal with Expedia about 10days before we travelled, and I suspect the room reflected the price. We'd asked for a room on a high floor and were accommodated, but a room that (in hindsight) was smaller than advertised was disappointing. There was a desk, but no easy chair - there wasn't room.Also, although there was free wifi in the hotel, we travelled without our laptop, and so interet access only available through the business centre. $5 for 15 mins (apprx) was quite disappointing.We spent little time in the hotel (maybe necasuse the room was so small), but would call it a very smart 3* rather than anything grander"
6,1942,"Nov 13 2009 	Quiet hotel in great area	Clean Quiet hotel on the upper west side. We stayed here for our first week in New York. Thinking that we could settle into new york on the uper west side before moving into midtown on the second week. The Hotel has a great location very close to the subway and right in the middle of the upper west side. I think this region of New York is some what under rated, it had great shopping, fantastic resturants and multi cultural vibe."
7,1942,"Nov 9 2009 	Worth the Money	After a whole lot of research, my former college roomates and I decided to stay at the Lucerne for a girls' reunion weekend. We were sooooo very pleased with the facilities and the courteousness of the staff. There were four of us, all coming from different parts of the country, some flying in and others driving. The staff went out of their way to open our suite early so the first of us was able to relax while waiting for the rest of the group to arrive. The suite was a fairly typical size for Manhattan--definitely not huge, but perfect for the four of us. The bedding was insanely comfortable--I'm a total bedding snob, and their pillows and linens rival what I have at home. Everything was meticulouslyly decorated and CLEAN!!! We all agreed we felt like we were at a spa. The location worked very well for us, as we knew we'd be spending most of our time on the Upper West Side. I would stay here again and again--it's so hard to find the right combination of affordability, elegance and professionalism when it comes to NYC's hotels, and The Lucerne is top-notch all the way."
8,1942,"Nov 8 2009 	Extremely well pleased with the Lucerne	Trip Advisor reviews, rank 14 of 418 hotels and perfect location for our visit to the Natural History Museum and relatively reasonable rate made the Lucerne a best pick for our overnight in NYC. It was perfect in every way, beautifully furnished, roomy enough, clean, quiet and plush enough for us to feel pampered. Four of us in a double were quite comfortable. The beds were very comfy, the bath large and bright, nice carpet, draperies, pillows. Never heard the honking horns during sleep. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. There's nothing I didn't like at the Lucerne."
9,1942,"Nov 6 2009 	Great Location but Noisy	The Lucerne Hotel is in a great location in the Upper West Side. It is so convienient to Restaurants, Central Park, Museums, Subway, etc. The Lucerne is a nice,clean hotel with all convienences. It is surrounded by great restaurants, groceries, stores, bakeries and more. The corner of Amsterdam and West 79th is however noisy with traffic, cabs horns, emergency vehicle sirens, police sirens, garbage trucks, buses and more.Our room was two doors down from the elevator on the top floor and we herd the elevator bell all night and people coming and going. It is also a resident hotel so there is some chatter in the hallways. We would stay here again. Next time we will request a room with a refrigerator and a microwave for breakfast items from the neighboring bagel shops."
10,1942,"Nov 5 2009 	great hotel great location	fabulous hotel in NYC. On Amsterdam Ave, walking distance from wonderful restaurants and bars ( Amsterdam Inn for a lively place). I stay at hotels all over the world and this is a reasonably priced very nice hotel in a quiet location. The service is excellent . The upper west side - walk to Central Park and the Museum of Nat History."
11,1942,Nov 3 2009 	Lovely classic hotel in a wonderful neighborhood.	We spent 4 days in New York and decided to stay in the upper west side. Requires a bit more walking and transit planning but very worth while. Very nice neighborhood and seems less hustle and bustle compared to being in mid-town. The Lucerne was great. Close the the park and lots of great restaurants. Very nice room with all the amenities for a pleasant stay. Would highly recommend it.
12,1942,"Nov 1 2009 	Nice hotel fantastic Upper West Side location	My husband and I stayed here for six nights in September. We were travelling with our 14-months old son and wanted to stay in a child-friendly area close to the park. I love Upper West Side but had never stayed here before. When we started to look for hotels in NY, we thought that The Lucerne was pretty expensive, but what hotel in this city isn't? We decided to book the Lucerne (with the AAA rate), and were happy that we did. We requested a room on a high floor and was put on the 10th floor. We stayed in a corner Deluxe Double Room, which was very spacious and perfect for our little boy to crawl around. We asked for a crib for our boy. The first one was really squeaky and woke him up every time he moved, but thankfully housekeeping replaced it with a quieter one.The room was very nice and well kept, so was the bathroom. The front desk staff was nice, not overly friendly but correct, the bellboys were super nice and helped us with our stroller every time we came and left.We had all of our meals out, but needed boiled water to make oatmeal for our baby, for which the coffee maker worked fine. The location is perfect if you're looking for a quieter area in New York (well, New York is never really quiet) or if you're travelling with children. It's two blocks from Central Park and Museum of Natural History. Our favorite breakfast place, Sarabeth's, is two blocks up on Amsterdam Av, couldn't have been better for us! A lot of strollers in the neighborhood and baby chairs in every restaurant that we went to. If we can't find a better deal next time, we'll definitely stay here again!"
13,1942,"Oct 28 2009 	My new favorite spot in the city: a lovely SILENT hotel room in NY!!	I just spent one night at the Lucerne, based solely on the fab reviews here. I've stayed at many hotels in town (Essex House, The London, Elysee, Dylan, Morgan's, The Hudson, etc.) and NONE of them could offer what the Lucerne provided: an absolutely SILENT room! When I say my room was silent, I do not mean that the traffic noise was really well-muffled. I mean that my room was absolutely silent all night long - like sleeping in a vault. There was no noise, no sounds. None. I slept from midnight until 7 AM, and the only sound I heard was my own breathing - and I'm not a loud breather. And here's the kicker - I was on the 4th floor! Go figure. When I checked in, I asked the delightful gentleman at the desk for the quietest room in the hotel. That is always my only request because I have super-sensitive ears &amp; can hear everything. I almost always end up resorting to earplugs whenever I'm in NY because it's the only way I can sleep. Never again. From now on, I'm only staying at the Lucerne. If silence is a necessary luxury for you, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.I agree with everything everyone else has said about the spotlessness of the hotel, the charming decor, and the really spectacular staff. The bell staff opens the door for everyone, whether you're coming in or going out. That may sound like a lame thing to mention, but frankly, I find that it's a very nice touch. The front desk personnel are also exceptionally polite and pleasant. I love the location of the hotel for all of the reasons that have already been mentioned, by others. There is nothing negative that I can say about this hotel. It deserves all of the terrific reviews &amp; I can't wait to stay there again."
14,1942,"Oct 19 2009 	Clean affordable and great location.	This was a very nice place. The rooms were bigger than most we've seen in NYC, and very clean. The water pressure in the bathroom was amazing (it might sound weird to comment on that but because of the great water pressure that shower was awesome). The location also exceeded our expectations: a subway stop a block away; numerous restaurants and cool bars on Amsterdam/Broadway; Natural History Museum and Central Park only a few blocks away. The hotel also offers free wireless internet, which seems rare these days. Only minor complaints: it was pretty noisy when housekeeping started their work in the a.m., and the front desk staff was perfectly fine but didn't seem terribly eager to offer assistance. Really, though, this would be a great choice if you want to avoid the madness of Midtown but still have lots of eating/drinking/entertainment options close by."
15,1942,Oct 18 2009 	Would definitely recommend	My husband and I just returned from 4 nights at the Lucerne and we will definitely return in the future. The staff were courteous and helpful and the room was larger than we expected. We arrived early and we were able to get into our room at that time. The hotel and the room were always clean as far as we could tell.The location is excellent for walking and close to bus and subway transportation (about 1 block).
16,1942,"Oct 17 2009 	Truly a wonderful place to stay!	We (family of 4) stayed here for 5 nights from Oct. 13-18, 2009.We have vacationed in Manhattan before and LOVE staying in the Upper West Side.The staff at the Lucerne Hotel was friendly, polite, and helpful...Room (queen suite) was roomy, quiet, comfortable &amp; METICULOUS!Location cannot be beat - surrounded by great restaurants, two laundries/drycleaners RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET...24 hour pharmacy RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET...1 block to #1 subway (to Times Square, Macy's, Columbus Circle, Soho, Harlem...etc.), Walking distance to Central Park and Museum of Natural History...When we are back in NYC there is absolutely NO DOUBT where we will stay. This one has it all...LOCATION, CONDITION &quot;and&quot; PRICE!"
17,1942,"Oct 15 2009 	Home away from home in NYC	During this, our first visit to NYC, we chose the Lucerne based on our following wishes: a stay in a quiet but central neighborhood, close to the subway and reasonably (for New York!) priced. The Lucerne was excellent on all accounts - the staff was very courteous and extremely helpful. Our queen room, although not huge, was still adequate according to this city's standards, and the coffee machine (it wasn't in the room but we asked for it, after reading about this free amenity on the hotel's website) was provided instantly and was MUCH appreciated every morning, along with the excellent Wolfgang Puck filter coffee. I also liked getting a complimentary newspaper left at our door each morning (NY Times or USA Today). The room was nicely made up everyday to our satisfaction and having things like an iron and ironing board, along with an umbrella, was greatly appreciated by us, as we were staying for a week and enjoyed the home-like atmosphere. These were all very thoughtful and practical touches. We had breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, Nice Matin, only twice as it was a bit pricey, but it was very good. However, there are a ton of other places to grab a quick, tasty and cheaper breakfast in this wonderful area (Zabar's, H&amp;H Bagels) on the Upper West Side. Also, having a subway station only a 5-minute walk from the hotel made our visit a whole lot more pleasurable. With taxes, the whole stay came out to about $295 a night which, although not cheap, is quite OK, price-wise, for a Manhattan stay. The hotel is 2 blocks away from Central Park and also the Natural History museum. We would definitely stay there again, no hesitation whatsoever."
18,1942,"Oct 7 2009 	great location beautiful hotel every detail attended to-- decor amenities etc.. lovely!	got a great AAA rate at upper westside traditionally decorated hotel.front desk staff very pleasant and accomodating.lobby, hallways and room impeccably decorated and well thought out- flat screen tv, coffee maker in room with high end quality coffee and tea, toiletries also high end.- the rate was incredibly low for nyc ($185) and this is a great location- neighborhood and easy access to subways.I would easily stay here again and again!"
19,1942,"Oct 6 2009 	Great place to stay for your first time in NYC.	This was my first time in NYC and the hotel was in a perfect location. Friendly staff, clean room, comfortable bed. The room was rather small, but we weren't there long enough for it to matter. The elevator is small too. Several times we just went down the stairway. Glad we were on the 4th floor.Loved the restuarant next door and Coppola's Restuarant is across the street and a wonderful place to eat. Very romantic, well priced and delicious."
20,1942,"Oct 5 2009 	Fantastic location	This a a fantastic hotel and would recommend staying here. I spent days &amp; days searching online for the right hotel as I'd heard so many awful New York hotel stories. This was my first visit to New York and I was not disappointed with The Lucerne. I requested a mini fridge in the room; this was provided at no extra cost and i even asked for a low-noise level room! (again ... stories of noisy hotel rooms) The room was spacious and the 2 double beds were very, very comfortable. The best location; one block away from subway, very close to Central Park and there is just the best ever Italian restaurant opposite the hotel. Dont waste you time searching for any other hotels in New York just book this one."
21,1942,"Oct 3 2009 	classy hotel with a friendly attitude	We really liked the location, lots of nice bars and restaurants. Very helpful and informative staff. Very nice quality room , just the right balance between old and new. The free wi-fi was terrific ."
22,1942,"Oct 1 2009 	Excellent value on Upper West Side	A nice hotel room on the Upper West Side for $189 (w/o taxes) is unheard of in NYC, according to my friends who live there. Well the Lucerne provided just that. Rooms are slightly small, but average in size comparison to other NYC hotels. Great location within walking distance to Museum of Natural History and Central Park. Pick up breakfast bagels at H&amp;H Bagels around the corner to start your day!Only bad part of experience was when cleaning person tried to enter room without knocking or anything. I heard the key swipe and the handle turn. No, &quot;house keeping&quot; or &quot;may I enter&quot; beforehand. As I was in the middle of changing clothes, I freaked out and was only saved by the fact that I had done the flip lock, which only allows the door to open a couple inches."
23,1942,"Sep 29 2009 	Easily met our expectations	Based on great reviews here we tried Lucerne and were not disappointed. The location is excellent (block away from subway, or a pleasant night-time walk up Columbus Ave from mid-town), the room was attractive and clean, the front desk was helpful. We had a 10th floor room with a lovely view up Amsterdam Ave."
24,1942,"Sep 20 2009 	Nice.	We stayed in the King Suite with a young child and teenager. The hotel is clean, spacious, comfortable and in a good locaton (only one subway to Times Square). It is close to some excellent restaurants. The maid service and door service was friendly and accomodating. However, the front desk was somewhat cold in their approach. They did not welcome us to the hotel or thank us for our stay which we found to be somewhat unusual.It was out son's 16th birthday and we had cake delivered to our room prior to our arrival. Although there were four of us registered to arrive in the King Suite, there were only cups, and dishes for two people. We were also informed that we were not allowed to light candles on the cake. Very disappointing. (Not one staff member wshed him Happy Brthday which, again, has not been our experience at other hotels.I cannot find fault with ths hotel for the basics. We apprecated our room. However, they did not offer any &quot;extras&quot;."
25,1942,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Hotel - Great Service!	Just stayed one night at the Lucerne, but will definitely return. We were in NYC for Andrea Bocelli at Carnegie Hall and the US Open Tennis tournament. Although these events were nowhere near the Lucerne, they were easily accessed by the nearby subway station. Zabar's in just around the corner as well as H&amp;H Bagels. We had dinner across the street at Coppolla's....every good food! We were allowed to check into our room early. The room was very large and clean. Other than the countertop in the bathroom being rather small, we had no complaints about The Lucerne. Awesome hotel in a great location!"
26,1942,"Sep 9 2009 	A splendid hotel for a reasonable price! Incomparable.	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Our room was comfortable, quiet, and well furnished. Staff were all polite and helpful often offering assistance and never failing to greet guests. There was good security with several staff always in the lobby monitoring the comings and goings of anyone who came into the lobby. Questions were answered politely and promptly. The room amenities - shampoo, conditioner, towels, soap etc were first class as was the in-room coffee. Management and staff were quick to acknowledge that we were celebrating an anniversary and birthday and helped to make the occasion a special one. We walked to most of the tourist attractions and entertainment and found the district very safe both in the daytime and the evening. Public transit was close by when needed. This is a wonderful place and I would not hesitate to recomment it to travellers who are looking for a comfortable and elegant hotel in a convenient location. Ann from Hamilton, Ontario."
27,1942,Sep 9 2009 	We would definately recommend this hotel to others!	We stayed for 5 nights and found the service at this hotel to be very friendly yet professional. we requested prior to our stay that we had quiet rooms and this was honoured. rooms were clean and surpirsingly large. Other guests appeared to be mainly family groups and older friends which was perfect for us - we wanted to make sure we had a hotel that would be quiet in the evening and where we could get a good nights sleep after a busy day! Location is on the side of the park so you are not in the middle of the choas of Times Sq which again was perfect for what we were looking for as we reguarly visit NY. - the subway and cabs make it cheap and easy to get anywhere on manhattan.Would definately recommend to stay here if you want a peacecul hotel with character and charm with convenient access to all the NYC choas!
28,1942,"Sep 9 2009 	Excellent	We stayed here for 5 nights and found the hotel extremely comfortable. Our room was a Queen Superior which was very comfortable and well furnished. The only down point in the room was a very tiny wardrobe / storage unit for clothing, could be bigger. However, the hotel is situated in a fantastic location with wonderfull eateries within walking distance and also close to the subway for frequent trains anywhere in Manhatten and beyond. Central Park is a 5 minute walk and is a gem to visit. We had a fantastic holiday in New York and the Lucerne is an ideal hotel to stay. We would have no hesitation in returning there for our next trip."
29,1942,"Sep 8 2009 	Great hotel at a reasonable (by NY standards) price	We were extremely impressed by our stay at the Lucerne. Room was quite large for a Manhattan hotel, immaculately clean and super-quiet. The hotel was fully booked, but we did not hear any noise from neighboring rooms. It was truly a quiet oasis in the big city. The bed was unbelievably comfortable -- it was hard to drag yourself out of bed to enjoy the rest of the city.Initially, I was concerned about the location, since I had originally wanted to stay closer to the &quot;action&quot; in mid-town. However, decided on the Lucerne because the price was tough to beat for all the amenities. It turned out to be a great location, within a block or two of Central Park, one block from the subway, and located on a stretch of Amsterdam with tons of little restaurants and pubs. Paid only about $200/night, which is a STEAL in Manhattan for a hotel of this quality.Best of all was the service from the entire staff. The desk clerks bent over backwards to be helpful, right down to assisting us with advance check-in for our next day's flight. Free wireless a plus as well. We will definitely be back again. The Lucerne is among the top few hotels we've experienced in a long history of international travel."
30,1942,Sep 7 2009 	Best Deal in New York	As I do with all my other hotel stays I checked Trip Advisor and found that all the recent reviews were very posative. Since I travel to New York often I knew of this hotel but had not stayed here. I got a fair rate directl form the hotel usin AAA. They do check the card on arrival. It lived up to previous reviewers. It is all redone and immaculate. The rooms though no huge are good sized by New York standards. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel- Nice Matin and were very plased. Good food and reasonable by New York standard. I like he neighborhood- clsoe to Zaybars . The only thing that disappointed was the lack of a pool but I knew that going there in advance. Great value for the money.
31,1942,"Aug 28 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Great Neighborhood	Spent 3 nights at this hotel with my two teenagers and plan on staying there again. The staff was great, the room was very nice and the Upper West Side (much nicer than noisy Time Square) location can't be beat. One block from the subway ,a five minute walk to Central Park and many fine restaurants and shops. And did I mention the price. The Lucerne Hotel has the NY hotel market cornered when it comes to value for money. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
32,1942,"Aug 26 2009 	Excellent hotel friendly staff fair price	My family had a very nice stay at the Lucerne and I would stay there again without hesitation. We paid an excellent price (arranged through Westjet), had no problems with reservations, the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant, security in the hotel was excellent (always three or four staff members on duty in the lobby, no other way up to the rooms), the room was spotlessly clean, and the location is good (close to subway, walkable to Times Square if like me you like to walk a lot, a cab ride to the theatre district was about $10), it's in a completely safe area, surrounded by many great restaurants and nice pubs. There's a restaurant in the hotel that looked OK, but I never used it because there were so many more interesting restaurants in the vicinity. Any minuses? Well, the room was a bit small - but what hotel room in New York isn't? It took a while to get hot water in the afternoons, for some reason. There was plenty first thing in the morning and late at night. Go figure! But other than that, everything was fine - the beds were comfortable, the air conditioner worked great and the elevators were fast. What's not to like about this place?"
33,1942,"Aug 25 2009 	So Good Went Back a 2nd Time	There are hundreds, maybe thousands of hotels in NYC and making a choice of hotels and neighborhoods is difficult, at best. The Lucerne Hotel has the kind of qualities that makes one want to return. We stayed with one teenage son over the 4th of July weekend, and then returned in August with both of our teenage sons. Got the &quot;corner room&quot; which is large enough for four without each of us tripping over one another. Only advice about rooms is ask for a higher floor if you can get it. as there are very pretty views higher up which we were treated to on our first stay, but not our second stay on the third floor.While the hotel offers a discount on breakfast at the restaurant connected to it, we found that a bagel shop 1 1/2 blocks south on the west side of Ansterdam Avenue provided just the perfect combination of fresh bagels with cream cheese and orange juice to take back up to the room. There is a newstand on the corner that has just about every east coast daily newspaper desired (we got the Washington Post there each day of our stay). The hotel also delivers the NY Times or USA Today to the room on a compimentary basis. The restaurant connected to it is very nice for a late night glass of wine.Parking in NYC is expensive, but the hotel offers a $29 daily rate at a garage four blocks away ($29 for 24 hours), or they will valet park the car for you for $47. The second time we visited I took advantage of the park-it-myself option for $29. As long as you have the time, it is a nice way to save $18/day.About two blocks away on West 77th Street is the Vai Restaurant. It is small and it can be noisy but we enjoyed excellent food and service for both visits (again, it was so good we went back a 2nd time -- be sure to make reservations in advance -- www.opentable.com is good for this)."
34,1942,Aug 24 2009 	Clean good value for money	I stayed here with my wife for five nights and we were very happy with our stay. This was our second visit to NYC and we wanted to stay away from midtown and closer to central park. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Also there is a subway station less than a five minute walk away. If you are looking to stay uptown for a reasonable price then this hotel is for you. Free wifi is also a bonus.
35,1942,"Aug 21 2009 	Stay here when visiting NYC!!	Don't waste your time researching hotel after hotel in NYC, this is the place to stay! Very clean, spacious room, very friendly staff, offered us two double beds for the same price as the queen room that I had booked when they saw I was traveling with a friend. We loved the quiet street but felt close enough to the things we wanted to see (Central Park, museums). We also we able to check our bags at the hotel for no extra cost before the 4pm check in time. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
36,1942,"Aug 16 2009 	Clean hotel with friendly staff in fun safe neighborhood	We stayed at this hotel from August 11-15 for our anniversary and got a great AAA rate via the hotels website. This was my first trip to NYC and I picked this hotel solely based on Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed! The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood and was much less crowded than midtown area. The area felt safe during the day and at night. The subway was steps away so we were anywhere we wanted to be in minutes. There were many great restaurants in the area (Kefi, Nice Matin, Shake Shack, Rosa Mexicano, Sara Beths). Central Park, Natural History Museum, Dakota building, and Lincoln Center were also very close. The free wireless internet was a little spotty but I was still able to log on. Our room was clean, quiet, and the air conditioner worked well. The bathroom was pretty small but that did not bother us. All staff members were courteous and helpful. We plan to stay at the Lucerne again in the future."
37,1942,Aug 14 2009 	Great hotel big room good location.	Four of us stayed here (moms and daughters trip). Our room was huge and easily accomodated the 4 of us. The room was clean and quiet (I did request a room on the quiet side of the hotel). The metro is a block or two away. There are lots of restaurants nearby. The area is quiet and a welcome break from Times Square. I would definitely stay here again.
38,1942,"Aug 14 2009 	Stay Away if you are disabled	the hotel is not accessible. My son is in a wheelchair but can use crutches for a few steps. They directed us to a side entrance where we waited while they set up a homemade ramp. It was very steep and narrow and I knew I could not push him up so I made him get out of his wheelchair. Then he fell while trying to going up the ramp because it was too steep. Every time we wanted to go in the hotel, we would have to walk in the front door to get a bellhop to let us in the side door.The room was ok except for the dirty socks (not ours) left under the dresser."
39,1942,"Aug 11 2009 	great hotel and location	We stayed at this hotel based on reviews here, and weren't disappointed. The cost of the hotel seemed on par with others in NYC, maybe even cheaper (for those with own bathrooms, etc). We requested a room away from the street and had no problems with noise. Staff were very nice. Yes, the rooms are small but they're nice and you don't go to NYC to stay inside your hotel room. Wonderful location, the neighborhood is nice and very close to Central Park, etc. Perfect for someone who would rather have a neighborhood feel and doesn't want to stay in Times Square."
40,1942,"Aug 6 2009 	NIce clean hotel in a fun neighborhood	Nice and homey. Newly refurbished. The room was very pretty...nicely decorated, and we were pleasantly surprised by the decor. A bit small, and no safe to store valuables, but it was a good value. Bathroom was very nice and roomy. Tall ceilings. Not noisy as some have said, and I had feared. We were so tired that we never heard a thing in our 7th floor room facing Amsterdam. Very convenient to restaurants and subways. Breakfast at the restaurant was fabulous! I had salmon benedict. The hotel gave a 15% off coupon.Staff was very friendly and helpful. Free wi-fi. Free paper in the morning. Only negative...bed was not as comfortable for us as it could be. It was a bit nonconforming, and it didn't feel very plush. Comforter was not down. For a one night stay, it really matter very much, but had we stayed longer, I would have longed for a more comfortable bed and a larger room. However, I would stay here again, because all things considered, it was a wonderful stay."
41,1942,"Aug 3 2009 	Great location and value	We just got back from a two night weekend stay at the Lucerne with my wife and three year-old, a very positive experience.We drove into the city, and it's easy to get to by car from the west -- just headed over the George Washington Bridge, down the Henry Hudson, made a left onto 79th St and boom, you're there. There is a decent sized loading area in front, and the doorman was helpful. He asked if I wanted to use their parking service, and I said I thought I could probably find street parking (it was a Friday evening). He said I could park across the street using the meters until 7, and that he would let me have his space on 80th St. when he was off his shift at 9. Very nice of him! Turned out, I immediately found parking on the street a couple of blocks away so I didn't need it. Early on weekends, you can usually find free street parking on the Upper West Side.I checked in and received an upgrade to a Deluxe King Suite from a Deluxe Queen, which I didn't necessarily want but didn't mind. The suite consisted of a bedroom and large living room with desk, couch and chair. There were tv's in both the living room and bedroom. In between was a bathroom, fairly small, and a very small kitchen area with an empty fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The bath had a tub, which is great if you have a little one. Some dishes and utensils were provided. It would have been nice to have some glasses in addition to the plastic cups provided though. All of the furnishings were very comfortable, and the bed was very nice. Overall, this came for a price that would get you a boring single room in many name-brand Manhattan hotels, if that.There were separate air conditioners in the two rooms, and if anything, they were a bit too powerful. The windows actually open. Free wireless internet is provided, although it was a little slow.The service was great. Every single person working there treated us well and very pleasantly.The room was on the 4th floor, and as others have pointed out there was some street noise. Both Amsterdam and 79th are busy streets, and there are some bars and restaurants on Amsterdam that generate some noise. It didn't bother us though. If you are bothered by noise, you should request a room on a higher floor, or facing the back.The location is fantastic, especially if you're traveling with a small child. In the immediate neighborhood you have Zabar's (a large upscale market) around the corner on Broadway, so you can pick up food there and self cater if you want, with the fridge and microwave available. You also have H&amp;H bagels and a number of other places. The restaurant downstairs looked very nice, but we didn't eat there. The American Museum of Natural History is a very short walk away, as is Central Park. There is a very nice playground (Diana Ross) at the 81st Street entrance to Central Park. The Met and Guggenheim are also a pleasant, ~20-25 minute walk away through the park.The 1 subway line is right at 79th and Broadway, literally a 2-5 minute walk from the front door. That will take you right to Times Square and downtown. If I were going to NYC for a Times Square/theater/shopping centered vacation, this is a great location to stay, as all of those things are easily accessible, but you're in a much more real, less touristy location.Overall, a great experience, recommended especially if you have kids."
42,1942,"Aug 2 2009 	Beautiful Surroundings and Wonderful Service - what more could you ask for?	My family stayed at the beautiful Lucerne for 5 nights. We had great service, a clean and spacious (for NYC) room, very comfortable beds, quiet nights, good room temperature and courteous bellmen. The bellmen were wonderful when asked for recommendations for restaurants, buying some snacks and how and when to use the subway. Each time - the recommendations were great - thanks Manuel! Central Park and The Museum of Natural History are within a short walking distance. A convenient subway entrance is right down the street. There is a great restaurant called &quot;Good Enough to Eat&quot; a short walk away that we visited twice!"
43,1942,"Jul 26 2009 	LUCERNE HOTEL - CLASS ACT	Small hotel around 79th and Broadway which was convenient to Columbia University where my conference was at as well as accessible via subway to other areas.Room was clean, updated (flat Screen TV), and very nice compared to other NYC hotels I have stayed at. PLUS - they gave a free paper in the morning which is NOT the norm in NYC."
44,1942,"Jul 26 2009 	Perfect Second Honeymoon Locale	We were in a deluxe king room with two windows with views of uptown and the river. Clean rooms, great bedding, good size--even has an entry way and closet. The location is wonderful--walking distance to public transport, museums, and Central Park. The neighborhood is perfect--if you want a taste of resident New Yorkers without the BLING of Times Square. Great restaurants all along Amsterdam, too. We loved our stay so much that on our way back from a lovely jaunt to Newport Rhode Island, we opted to stay there one more night instead of staying on the coast. Have stayed at the Jumeirah Essex House for $350, and while we liked that room, the Lucerne offered us so much for $210. We like the neighborhood better, too, because it is much more hip and authentic.The doormen/porters are wonderful and the rest of the staff was completely helpful. It was the perfect place for us!"
45,1942,"Jul 25 2009 	The Lucerne ROCKS!	We stayed at the Lucerne from Jul 12 to 17. The check in was quick and smooth, and we stayed in Room 1101. It was a Deluxe King Room and it was absolutely fabulous! The room was huge and luxurious. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. The air condition was cool and worked like a dream, especially after a hot summer day in NY. The room did not have a view, which was fine with us, afterall, we spent most of the day outside. The room didn't come with a bar fridge, but when we asked for one, it was brought up to our room within minutes at no extra charge. The Lucerne also provides free internet if you bring your own laptop, all you need is to get a password from the front desk. As for location, the hotel is smack in the middle of shops, restaurants and the subway. The neighbourhood was &quot;true&quot; New York, not the touristy Time Square (which is where we stay a few years back). A couple of breakfast restaurant ideas that are close by and fairly cheap....the ever popular H&amp;H Bagels and Zabars. The one thing I wished the hotel had was a ramp to get up to the lobby. We had a stroller with us, and we had to carry it up and down every day. But the doormen were ever so willing to assist us with that. I highy recommend the Lucerne to anyone and everyone! We'll be back for sure!"
46,1942,"Jul 24 2009 	Best place to stay in NYC PERIOD	If you can find a nicer place for the money you need to post it. I have been traveling to NYC on business and never have I found a better place. Quiet, BIG rooms, and great service. Parking sucks since it is $$$ but where in NYC is it not? When in NYC SWBC stays here!!!!"
47,1942,"Jul 16 2009 	Impeccable	This lovely hotel was the right fit for a week long vacation in Manhattan! Located one block from the subway, surrounded by numerous restaurants on Amsterdam and Broadway avenues and staffed with courteous professionals, our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lucerne. The rooms are somewhat small but well furnished and immaculately maintained by the housekeeping staff. The hotels in house restaurant (Nice Matins) is upscale but there are numerous restaurants close by to fit any budget. Central Park is only a few blocks away for a quick lunchtime picnic! We highly recommend his hotel to first-time vacationers in Manhattan."
48,1942,"Jul 6 2009 	Just what I was looking for	I picked this hotel because of its location and price, because I wanted to go to the Museum of Natural History, Central Park, and Zabar's. But I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel, considering it was under $200 a night on the upper west side (excluding parking).In Manhattan, I usually settle for a place that's clean and affordable. But this place was more than clean - it was nice. It was quite spacious for a NYC hotel, easily twice the size of the room we stayed last time near Times Square. The staff was friendly. Although not advertised, they were happy to bring us a crib and a small fridge when we asked, for no additional charge. I also heard they had free wireless internet, but I didn't use it.Overall, I was pleased with the choice we had made - definitely a great place for the price and location."
49,1942,"Jun 29 2009 	A Perfect Stay	I've been a part of the Upper West Side of Manhattan for over 2 decades. The hotel's location is very safe and the neighborhood is semi residential. The hotel is located in a &quot;happening&quot; area with lots of restaurants, shops, a flea market on Sunday, occassional weekend festivals, and one of the greatest Natural History museums in the world, not to mention Central Park a brief stroll away. It's positioned between 2 subway lines, and also a nice stroll down to Lincoln Center. Years later, I've finally had the chance to stay at the Lucerne, and it was as good as I could have hoped for and better. Rooms (ours was a delux) were clean and spacious with marble-topped desks and counters, comfortable beds, high-quality teas and coffees and bathroom amenities. Housekeeping even stopped by to make sure everything in our room was in order. We did not have a street-facing room - and that was perfectly fine as we had zero street noise to contend with - The hotel is located on a popular street corner with a restaurant below that features outdoor seating for late-nite dining.The hotel lives up to its high ratings on Trip Advisor. Really a lovely boutique hotel that has its act put together well."
50,1942,"Jun 28 2009 	Elegant Clean Great Location	We reserved a King Suite (at a discounted suite rate special available at the time). The room was very nice, modern, elegant, and clean. There is a complete separate living area with sleeper sofa from the King bedroom. This appears to be one of the larger rooms in the hotel. This was ideal for our travel with my spouse and 19 year old daughter. The bathtroom was small but generous by NYC standards. Service was polite and prompt but no over the top. WiFi internet is free. We were granted a 2pm late checkout without problems. The hotel is in a great location with many excellent restaurants in walking distance. Easy walk to Central Park. One short block to the 1 train (subway). This area is a complete different experience from our previous stays in Midtown. We will definitely stay here again."
51,1942,"Jun 26 2009 	Lucerne is great	We booked 4 nights in a two double -not sure whether it was called deluxe or superior. It was rather small for the 3 of us because it was not a corner unit, however the price via Expedia was very good. We requested an upgrade to a larger unit, which I was willing to pay for, but they gave us a complimentary upgrade for 2 of the 4 nights which was wonderful !The hotel is in a great location- just a short walk to metro, park and great eateries. It is in a nice neighborhood, and the hotel staff were very friendly. We will definitely return."
52,1942,"Jun 18 2009 	smart but affordable close to central park	Great hotel. Not too expensive, clean, modern and in a fantastic area if you want to be near central park. Also, very quick to get to times square as its right near a direct tube line.there are loads of bars,restaurants and shops in the area and there is a lively young feel at the weekend when the columbia university students are out and about.The hotel gives a 15% discount on breakfast at Nice Matin, the bar/ restaurant next door but we preferred the diners nearby on Broadwayfor the real new york experience. The barman at Nice Matin, Carlo, however was really friendly and gave us some top tips about the area, such as the best places for hot dogs and bagels."
53,1942,"Jun 12 2009 	Impressive	Stayed at the hotel overnight while attending my son's college orientation. Only really had the pleasure of staying the night but what agreat short stay. Check in took about 2 minutes at most. Bellhop helped us find a parking spot across the street and saved us $55 from having to garage it. The room was impeccably clean and tidy, very modern and chic. Comfortable bed only sore point was asked for a 6am wakeup call and never got it. Luckily I am a light sleeper. Great little restaurant /bar adjacent to hotel Martin Matin or something like that. Found a new home for my NY stays."
54,1942,"Jun 9 2009 	Great location and value	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Lucerne Hotel for 6 nights in early June. I heard that the Upper West Side was a good location for travellers who wanted to avoid the craziness of Times Square and I chose this hotel after reading TripAdvisor reviews. We weren't disappointed. There was a bit of a line when we checked in, but we arrived right at 3pm. We booked a queen room and were offered an inside or outside room. We chose the inside room on the 6th floor for quietness and didn't hear a peep from the streets. We still had a partial view of 79th and Broadway, so it wasn't like we were facing a brick wall. The room was smaller than in other cities, but wasn't crowded. The closet and bathroom were a good size. The bed was firm and comfortable. There was no minifridge, but we didn't have a suite. You could hear a bit of noise from the hall, but nothing unmanageable.We really loved the location. On W 79th St, closer to Amsterdam than Broadway. Zabar's is right around the corner and is worth a stop (or three!). There are tasty and reasonably priced restaurants in the area. Central Park is 3 blocks walk away, as is the Museum of Natural History. The Met Museum is across the park. The 1 line stops at the corner of 79th and Broadway and the B &amp; C are a few blocks away by the Natural History Museum. These take you to midtown in about 15 minutes. Personally, after spending about 5 minutes in Times Square, I'm glad my &quot;home base&quot; was not there. I felt I got a better, less touristy idea of what it was to live in NYC by staying where we did."
55,1942,"May 31 2009 	Pick your View Carefully: Noisy but Interesting or Quiet but Boring	We have stayed here several times for the Marathon--the suites have a bedroom and living room with a pullout sofa. There is a tiny kitchenette and an equally tiny bathroom--service is very nice, however and rooms very clean. The main drawback is the street noise on Amsterdam--people are partying all night--the noise bounces off the building like crazy...It is kind of fun to look out the window at all the action if you are jet-lagged but I suggest that after you book a room--call the hotel directly and make sure you have a quiet room--the drawback being a quiet room can mean you are facing an airshaft--pick your poison--noise and view or quiet and a brick wall!"
56,1942,May 19 2009 	Great Hotel	We stayed three nights at the Lucerne. The value for the price is excellent. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The staff are great and the location is ideal for tourists. It is a short walk to museums and Central Park. Restaurants in the neighbourhood are good and access to the subway is very simple. Free wireless internet access in the rooms was a nice extra.We will return to the Lucerne this fall and see more of New York.
57,1942,"May 19 2009 	Love Returning Time After Time - Never Disappointed	My wife and I have stayed at the Lucerne several times since discovering this hotel in 2000, and we continue to be charmed by this hidden gem. On our most recent trip, we stayed at the Lucerne immediately before leaving on, and then upon returning from, a two-week trip to Europe. What a great place to recover from jet lag!The staff at the Lucerne  many of whom have been there since we starting visiting  are warm and welcoming. They treat people as honored guests rather than simply customers.The hotel offers the amenities we expect today, including 24-hour room service (provided by adjacent and neighboring restaurants with which the hotel has arrangements), a modest fitness center, wireless Internet connections, hair dryer, ironing board and iron, and bathrobes. But the Lucerne also offers several things many other hotels dont: location, charm, and value.The Lucerne is located at 79th and Amsterdam on Manhattans Upper West Side. Its an active New York neighborhood with several Zagat-rated restaurants nearby (including the adjacent Nice Matin, and a Coppola's across 79th Street), as well as plenty of shopping and entertainment, all within easy walking distance. The hotel is one block from the 1-2-3 subway lines, which is quite convenient for exploring other parts of the area or getting to your meeting downtown. Its also within striking distance of Central Park, the American Museum of Natural History, and Museum Mile.Were told the building, completed in 1904, once housed a dormitory for a nearby university. Today, it offers over 180 rooms and suites.Clearly, the management of the hotel understands how important it is to stay current and contemporary. Within the last couple of years, the hotel has completed thorough renovations of its guest rooms and, as we've come to expect, everything is top-notch. Our most recent stay was in a small suite, which had two queen beds in the bedroom and a sofa, TV, microwave, fridge, and service items (plates, cups, flatware) in a second, smaller room. It was more than adequate, though the King suite I enjoyed during a recent business trip was the absolute top of the line! However, I would describe even the Lucerne's standard rooms as cozy, not cramped, as have been others at which Ive stayed in the City  including a room at a major chain off Times Square.Finally, the Lucerne offers excellent value. During the business trip I mentioned, staying at the Lucerne saved my company $150 over the chain hotel they'd booked for me in the Financial District. The bean counters were not unhappy (are they ever &quot;happy&quot;?)Whether traveling to New York City for business or pleasure, we highly recommend the Lucerne! We'll certainly be back."
58,1942,"May 18 2009 	Almost perfect experience	Four of us stayed at the Lucerne over Mother's Day weekend (early May '09). Two moms and our 2 sons. Almost everything was perfectly pleasant, from the helpful and nice bell staff to the front desk staff at check in. Our room was nice. We got the suite with 2 queen beds and a pull out couch. The beds were comfortable, though the pull out was not. Plus when you pulled out the couch, we had to move the desk so that we could squeeze by to the bathroom. But that's NYC for you! Very nice lobby and hallways. Champagne and chocolates on Mother's Day. Clean, smelled nice, and nicely decorated. Our only problem was that the first day, the AC in the sitting room froze over - the compressor coils literally had ice on them and the unit was not blowing cold air. Since we had a 2nd unit in our sleeping area, I didn't call the front desk. Unfortunately, the 2nd nite around 9 pm the 2nd unit also froze over, so we had no AC. I didn't call the front desk because I know from my husband's AC business that this was not a quick fix at a time that we wanted to go to bed. I regretted my decision when the room got hot and stuffy in the middle of the night and no windows to open. In the morning when I check out, I explained the situation to the manager (Darren) and asked for a deduction on our room, he asked why I had not called downstairs the night before. Also, he said since I had the least expensive rate already, all he could do was to give me an upgrade the next time I was at his hotel. Not sure I feel so great about that. On the other hand, we did have a great rate. And it's a nice hotel in a nice area. Go to Cafe Con Leche around the corner for the best coffee."
59,1942,"May 18 2009 	Really good	Best of all is probably the location in the Upper West Side, just a short walk to Central Park, a block to the subway, thus very convenient to get anywhere! The neighbourhood is great and there are plenty of places to eat, have a drink and even to do some shopping. Yet the hotel is quiet.The staff is nice. The place is clean and the rooms are spacious. The bed was comfortable. There is an iron and ironing board in the room. And they have free Internet access.In brief: I enjoyed the stay, the place is very good and I would definitely recommend it!"
60,1942,"May 18 2009 	Great stay in an idyllic neighborhood	I stayed for the second time at the Lucerne this May. Having lived in NYC for 3 years in the 1990's, I am fond of the Upper West Side and it's my preferred neighborhood, away from the noise of Times Square and traffic of midtown. My king deluxe room was excellent, with a chaise lounge, king bed, and air conditioning. My room faced away from Amsterdam Avenue, so at night it was very quiet (for NYC!). The hotel staff was helpful and courteous, and I had no problem getting where I wanted to go because of the close proximity of the metro line (1) and the M79 bus to the upper east side. There is also a Duane Reade across the street, which is quite convenient for getting snacks, water (avoid the $$$ bottled water in room), mouthwash, and other sundries.My only quibble is that the bathroom wall tiles were a bit grungy. But otherwise, the sink and toilet were spotless when first entering the suite. Take advantage of the deals offered when you book for 3 or more nights. They can save $$$, and still, the rooms were very good value for the posted online rates. Avoid the breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Nice Matin, as you can get cheaper, more filling breakfasts elsewhere on Columbus and Amsterdam cafes just a few blocks away. Plenty of bistros within a 5-block radius, so there was no shortage of interesting multi-ethnic cuisine.I will certainly make the Lucerne my hotel of choice for future trips! Its location and ambience are terrific."
61,1942,May 18 2009 	Excellent	Having stayed in New York a number of times over the years this hotel provided the best value for money of the hotels I have stayed in. The location is excellent and the staff and service very good. Having asked for a quiet room when making the reservation we had to wait for the room to be ready which it was by the stated checkin time.
62,1942,"May 13 2009 	Lucerne was Great! We'll be back!	Stayed at the Lucerne May 6-12 - everything was great. Subway just 1/2 block away, Central Park 2 blocks, nice area. Room was clean and roomy! Nice Matin, the restaurant next door was great - breakfast was good and hottest coffee around! Will definately stay at the Lucerne next trip to NYC!"
63,1942,"May 5 2009 	What a find!!	We have visited NYC many times over the years, and always have stayed at moderately-priced hotels. Most of the time, this requires certain tradeoffs. Not this time. The Lucerne Hotel was perfect in every way. Service was always friendly, impeccable, and genuine---not done with the proverbial hand out for a tip. The best and friendliest service, by far, we have ever had in a NYC hotel. We arrived very late at night, due to flight delays, yet our specific room requests on our reservation were honored. The hotel is clean, very quiet, and our room was comfortable and roomy, by New York standards. There is free Wi-Fi in the rooms. The location is great--we like the Upper West Side, and it is a half block from a subway stop. They offer a complimentary daily New York Times outside your door-- a nice touch for a moderately priced hotel. Two quibbles: 1) the computers in the business center should be free, not $5.00 for the most minimum usage, and 2) please get rid of the $6.50 bottled water--these are both chintzy off notes in an otherwise perfect place. From now on, we will stay here every visit."
64,1942,"Apr 26 2009 	Great NYC experience	This hotel is located on the Upper West Side near Central Park and the Museum of Natural History. The neighborhood is pleasant, much less crowded than the Times Square area. The subway is less than a block away, so the entire city is within easy reach.We enjoyed our stay at the Lucerne. The room was extremely clean and well-stocked, the staff helpful, and everything went very smoothly. We would certainly stay there again.The hotel offers discounted parking at a garage a few blocks away. You can use valet service or park your car yourself. We had no need of the car during our stay, but make sure you have all items you need from your car, because you won't have easy access."
65,1942,"Apr 24 2009 	Lovely	Great location, and well-maintained. Close to subway, restaurants, park. Room was very nice but New York tiny. Friendly front desk but not really much customer service. (Check out took a really long time because only one clerk and person in front of me had a complicated billing issue.)"
66,1942,"Apr 21 2009 	Perfect location for Central Park and the Museum of Natural History : )	My daughter and I were in New York for a fun, sightseeing, show-seeing long weekend in March. We both LOVED The Lucerne - the front desk personnel and doormen were l friendly, room was sparkling clean with very comfortable beds, small adjacent restaurant served very yummy breakfasts and the location was perfect for us!It is in a mainly residential area, charming restaurants and bakeries close by and walking distance to the museum and Central Park.. It was nice to be a short cab or subway ride to Times Square and to return to our quiet room at The Lucerne at the end of the day. Would absolutely recommend this hotel and hope to return to it soon!"
67,1942,"Apr 15 2009 	We've found our home away from home in NYC	We visit our son attending Columbia U. in NYC from time to time, and the Lucerne has become our hotel of choice. Great service, quiet, comfortable rooms, vibrant-convenient neighbourhood. We parked 3 blocks away for $29.00 a day.We took the subway to Brooklyn, South Street Seaport and the west village, plus cabbed elsewhere for under 15 bucks, all from within steps of the hotel.2 tips; bring a corkscrew/bottle opener and something to pour water into the coffee maker in your room. It doesn't have a carafe, and the mugs aren't easy to handle.We'll definitely be back!"
68,1942,Apr 14 2009 	An excellent friendly hotel in a great part of New York	We took a long time before deciding to book the Lucerne and found the tripadvisor reviews were pretty much spot on. The hotel is located in the Upper West Side - a great location away from the fast pace of NY life and an easy walk to Central Park. A very safe neighbourhood with a great choice of places to eat. All of the staff were very freindly - in particular the 'bellboys'. The room was spacious enough for a family of 3 even after allowing for two double beds. Clean and well furnished with a great power shower. The hotel was more than happy to look after two suitcases and loads of shopping bags on our last day. I'd be pleased to recommend the Lucerne.
69,1942,"Apr 12 2009 	We would recommend to friends and family	The Lucerne is located on New York's Upper West Side. It is a nice boro of the city close to the Museum of Natural History and Central Park. The Lucerne is located very close to subway terminals as well. The hotel room we stayed in ( 1queen bed) was small (typical of NYC) but very nice. The bathroom had upscale granite and bath tile. The closet is also small. But the room was clean and fresh. The doormen and concierge were very helpful to us during our stay. There are many small deli/markets nearby if you need anything. A larger market called Fairway Market is not too far away if you need anything more extensive then what the smaller markets have. For breakfast, if you want a quick cheap breakfast I recommend the danish /coffee cart down 79th close to the subway terminal or H&amp;H Bagles at 79th and Broadway. I avoided the hotel restaurant for breakfast. Also, I reommend going to Smoke at West105thStreet. Outstanding jazz........very intimate."
70,1942,"Apr 12 2009 	I'll Stay Here Again	Although I hadn't spent much time in NYC prior to this trip, I know that we found a keeper. The Lucerne is a lovely little boutique hotel in a great location on the Upper West Side. It is a block from the subway, and a short walk to Central Park. The restaurant next door is fabulous, as are several of the others nearby. The staff was friendly &amp; responsive, going out of their way to make us feel welcome and valued."
71,1942,"Apr 5 2009 	Wonderful choice for NYC - Great Value	This hotel has been beautifully redecorated with very nice rooms and baths. Staff is excellent. Location in upper west side is handy to museums, etc. I have no negatives. Price for NYC was very good for the quality of this beautiful property. We plan to stay here on future visits. An excellent value."
72,1942,"Mar 31 2009 	Great location but expected more	Booked their suite special 2 nights $450 (1/2 price second night). Although I am aware check-in is at 3pm, my son and I arrived at 10:30am. They told me to check back soon for an available room. I came back at 1:30pm and was sent to what appeared to be the only room available. The stentch of body odor from the prior occupant was so offensive we could not stay in the room. They had the window open to air it out. Not a great first impression. I was then told there was no other room yet, but then after the someone checked with the manager, a new room was available. It was recently renovated so much cleaner and nicer than the first. The hotel location is key to it's appeal. Central Park, museums, restaurants all within walking distance. The major problem I have with the hotel was that I came down with a virus the morning we checked in. It was so bad that I asked my husband the next morning to check with the front desk to see if we could cancel our reservation for that evening (the 2nd night) without penalty as I could barely get out of bed and wanted to go home (we live an hour away). The front desk said no problem. We made it clear that if there was a penalty we would stay (as my husband could have taken my son out while I rested). Upon checkout, they charged us $300 for the one night. We told them we would stay then but they said they already &quot;sold&quot; the room. They indicated I signed upon checkin something that indicated $300 first night, $150 second night (which I knew, which is why we asked if we would not be penalized and pay half of the entire bill or $225). They refused to honor their prior agreement to not penalize us. Although not a really big deal, it did not leave a &quot;good taste&quot; in our mouths or wanting to return here. I would suggest Affinia hotels (the Shelburne has under $200 suites that are larger and brand new, they were booked which was why we chose the Lucerne). NOTE: although they charged us $300, if I booked this room for one night, the online cost is $290."
73,1942,"Mar 29 2009 	Loved this hotel!	Charming location-you feel more like a resident than a tourist. Yet restaurants and shops and Central Park close by. Our room was large, clean and well-appointed. Staff courteous and friendly. Room came with an umbrella which came in handy."
74,1942,"Mar 20 2009 	A Very Nice Hotel in a Great Location	Each year, to celebrate my birthday, my family drives in from Connecticut to spend a night at The Lucerne, my favorite hotel in the City. We park in the lot recommended by the hotel (note: do not exceed the 24-hour time parking time limit, or your rate jumps from $29 to $78!) and walk to the hotel after browsing the many cute shops along the way. If you have never visited the City and want to spend time in a great neighborhood removed from the touristy Times Square area, come to The Lucerne. The Upper West Side has hundreds of cute shops and great restaurants. It's family-oriented and close to Central Park, several museums, and subway stations. You can't beat the location. If you want to be in the heart of NYC, this is probably not the place for you. The hotel itself is lovely; it is small, clean, and homey; if you require luxury and many amenities, you may want to consider another property. If you will be happy with clean, tastefully decorated and slightly upscale rooms, you will love it here! We appreciated the free wi-fi. Everyone with whom we dealt, from the door man to the front desk people, was friendly and professional. If you have a double stroller as we did, be prepared to fold it to get onto one of the two tiny elevators. Our room didn't have a fridge. The rooms are a decent size for NYC; request a corner room in the back of the hotel for something slightly bigger and quieter. This was the first year we had a room that faced 79th street; it was smaller and a bit louder. Caution: if you have small children, the windows open all the way and there are no safety barriers. Also for the first time this year, we were awakened at 3:30 a.m. by drunken young men coming back to the room next to ours. They were incredibly loud coming off the elevator, and once they entered their room, we could hear them as if they were in our room. I called the front desk and, within minutes, someone came up to the their room to speak with them. I was vengeful at 7 a.m. and phoned the men to tell them to stay at a youth hostel if they were going to behave that way. We love The Lucerne and recommend it highly; we usually pay over $300 a night, and this year the rate was $220. Yeah!"
75,1942,"Mar 15 2009 	Great value excellent service	Upper west side location in a &quot;real&quot; neighborhood close to good eats, small shops, bars, and most importantly Lincoln Center, Central Park and surrounding museums. Subway a short block away, if that is your preferred mode of travel. The hotel staff was outstanding, especially the concierge Liz. Rooms are tastefully decorated but nothing spectacular; they vary in size and noise level. Specify a quiet location, if available. We had a king suite on the 12th floor and rarely heard street noise. Bathrooms are small but who spends time there when in NYC? Small frig and microwave were convenient for bringing back leftovers. Also check room rates frequently. Right before we left on our trip, the internet rate dropped 25%. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to any friend or family member looking for reasonably priced hotel in an otherwise overpriced city."
76,1942,"Mar 4 2009 	Perfect Place for a New York Night Away from Home	I should start by saying that we visited the Lucerne at a verrry slow time of year and were pleased to get an upgrade from the very pleasant front desk staff. That set the stage for a delightful visit. Our upgraded room was spacious with a terrific view across the West Side, including a bit of the sunset on the Hudson River. The Lucerne is located on the Upper West Side, so it is not convenient for business in New York or for those planning to spend a lot of time at the theatre. It is, however, a perfect location for those on a leisure trip planning to spend time at the museums, amble about Central Park or visit one of the Citys most pleasant residential neighborhoods. And, of course, it is the perfect location for New Yorkers who want a night away from cramped apartments or a romantic evening away from home."
77,1942,"Mar 1 2009 	Comfortable and Upscale	The Lucerne was definitely a nice hotel. The room (two double beds) was large and spacious with a large bathroom. The room itself was very well appointed with marble tops on all of the furniture, plush bedding, neutral colors and very fluffy towels. I felt very comfortable in the room. Probably my only complaint was that the door didn't have a tight seal on it so a lot of light and noise from the hallway leaked in.I don't know that I would spend the money myself for this hotel ($205 a night). Since it was on business I didn't pick up the tab and it was a nice place to relax at the end of a long day.The staff was very helpful. I had checked out of another hotel down the street (cheaper and smaller since that night was on my dime) and walked into The Lucerne expecting to leave my bags in storage. At 8 a.m. there was a room ready and they allowed me to check-in at that time. The door man was always friendly and really went out of his way to hail us a cab."
78,1942,"Feb 27 2009 	Great choice for New York City hotel	My husband and I spent 5 days at the Lucerne on a leisure trip. We selected the hotel based on its location (upper West side) and Trip Advisor reviews. The Lucerne is close to several museums we wanted to visit and to Lincoln Center, and not too far from Broadway theaters. Taxi fares were reasonable to all of these locations. Other reviewers had reported accurately on their experience at The Lucerne. The hotel itself is quiet, very clean and with comfortable beds. The staff was most helpful and pleasant. I had to see a doctor on short notice and the hotel staff set up the appointment with their recommended doctor who took care of the problem. The surrounding area has everything travelers would need - good restaurants, a large drugstore/convenience store across the street, and many small shops selling coffee, etc. for breakfast or snacks."
79,1942,"Feb 23 2009 	Friendly clean great location!	I had a great stay at The Lucerne in Feb. 2009 --- the room was clean and comfortable and the location was unbeatable. The room may have been a little smaller than a standard hotel room, but hey, this is New York, and the space was more than adequate for one and would be perfectly fine for two. What I really enjoyed about my stay was the little perks: great shower products, always someone around in the lobby to answer questions and open the doors, 15% off breakfast at the connecting restaurant. I can't speak to value because my company was paying for it and I never saw the bill, but I would definitely stay here again assuming that the price is reasonable (as other commenters suggest it is)."
80,1942,"Feb 10 2009	The Lucerne in NYC	Spent one night here in January, 2009 and had one of the best experiences ever. Lovely, clean, quiet hotel with great views from the windows. Comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower. VERY nice desk staff...Can't wait to return!"
81,1942,"Jan 20 2009 	Upper West Side delight	Just returned from a weekend in New York and after checking the reviews decided to stay at the Lucerne, and we are glad we did. Our purpose in visiting New York was to see an exhibit at the New York Historical Society, which is an easy walk from our hotel, albeit a cold one because the temperature was frigid. The front desk staff was very pleasant and welcoming. We arrived fairly early in the morning so our room wasn't ready, but because they were accomodating us with a newly renovated room, I was happy to wait for it. And we weren't disappointed: room 617 is a king suite which we booked off the Lucerne website as a winter special. It was completely brand new; from the carpet to the furniture to the entirely new bathroom. I loved it. There is a great restaurant (Nice Matin) next door to the hotel that you can enter through a side door so you don't have to go outside, and we had a pleasant breakfast there, using a 15% off coupon provided by the hotel. Actually, we ate at the restaurant 3 times because it was so convenient and pleasant. The Upper West Side might not occur to everyone as a place to stay, but if you are looking for somewhere in a &quot;neighborhood&quot; that feels welcoming, safe, close to Central Park and several museums, this is a great place to be."
82,1942,"Jan 12 2009 	Perfect Long Weekend in the City	My wife, two kids an I stayed Friday night through Monday at the Lucerne based on my sister's recommendation. There were running a special on their website for 1/2 off the 2nd night, so I splurged a bit on the &quot;suite&quot;. I was glad for the little extra space, but the suite was small room adjoining the BR w/a two person couch, 2nd flatscreen TV, and a desk. There was also a microwave and a dorm sized fridge.The room was comfortable and well appointed w/very comfortable beds and down pillows. It was also fairly quiet, which can be hard to find in the city.The staff was helpful, yet unobtrusive. They extended my checkout till 2:00 when I only asked for 1:30.The location was excellent as has been noted. Two blocks to the natural history museum and central park, and a block from the subway. I would definitely consider staying here again if you are looking for the upperwest side."
83,1942,"Jan 5 2009	Great Hotel - Great Location	We spent 4 days in New York, our first trip there. The hotel was great. Very clean, nice quiet location. Plenty of room, we had a double queen suite with a separate living area with refrigerator and microwave. There is a small store across the street for snacks and beverages. The hotel has a car that will drive you to the airport for $45. Cheaper than what we paid to get to the hotel. If I ever decided to go back to New York, I would definitely stay here again."
84,1942,"Jan 3 2009 	Great stay at the Lucerne	This hotel is a great find! We (2 adults &amp; 2 children) have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Lucerne &amp; would definately stay there again. Located in a great part of the upper west side just far enough away from the hussle &amp; bustle of downtown but close enough to venture in when we wanted to. Very child friendly area, we had no concerns about staying here with our 2 daughters for our first visit to NYC. Very close to Central Park, Museum of Natural History, Children's Museum &amp; subway. Convenience store right accross the road. Plenty of food options close by on either Amsterdam, Broadway or Columbas. Staff were very friendly without getting in your face. Rooms were nicely renovated &amp; clean. We had a room with 2 double beds, adequate for the 4 of us if not a little small, but we were not in NYC to stay in our room all day so no problem. Only had 2 very small complaints:*No fan or vent in the bathroom which made for very foggy showers.*We were located opposite the room that stored the maids trolleys etc so we were woken by them getting their things out of the storage room each morning. If we were't sleepy heads &amp; had been out of bed before 8.30am this would not have been of any concern. Neither of these would stop us from staying here again, we would simply request a room not near the storage room.Don't hesitate to book here! We had a great stay."
85,1942,"Jan 1 2009 	Wonderful Hotel In New York City	This was a holiday to meet friends from Germany for Christmas and their travel agent had booked them at the Lucerne. I always thought it was a &quot;must&quot; to stay close to Times Square and the theatre district. Reluctanly, I made the reservation for us at the same hotel @ 79th St, W as my friend's travel agent booked. What a wonderful experience, we were greeted by the doorman and the desk clerk was outstanding also. We were one block away from subway, great restuarants and shopping and never needed a taxi except to get back to the airport. The staff was amazing in every way, always smiling, not the rude treatment that I had experience in NYC on other trips. It was a pleasure to ride the subway back to the hotel after a day of absorbing the great atmosphere of 'Christmas In New York', away from the crowds and noises of the city and be greeted by a friendly doorman and desk staff. The room was amazing, large enough and clean and greats furnishings, wide screen TV. Restuarants were close and the food selections were great and delicious. I will be staying here again on my next visit."
86,1942,"Dec 17 2008 	The Lucerne Hotel was the BEST!!!	A friend suggested The Lucerne and we are so glad we decided to stay there especially since it was our very first time to NY. The location and the neighborhood was perfect, but the staff at the Lucerne went above and beyond with great service!! They found out that it was my 50th and surprised me with a bottle of champagne. My husband and I couldn't have asked for anything more. We had reservations all over the city at big hotels, but this was so perfect in everyway! We will stay there again!!"
87,1942,"Nov 18 2008 	Great place!	Stayed at The Lucerne in September for 4 nights. Quiet hotel, but excellent location, Just out of the bussle and noise of the city, but right next door to a subway station, and a short walk to anything you could possibly need. Cannot recommend this hotel enough, the staff were helpful but did not interfere unless you needed them. The rooms were of a decent size, not bad for NYC, nice decor, and free wireless, and flat screen TV. Stayed in a Queen room and found it to be big enough for two people. Very clean, and maids did a good job every day. Free news paper every morning too. Great place, nice location, clean, friendly, and a definite recommendation! Will be going again, and have recommended to all my friends and family."
88,1942,"Nov 9 2008 	Reasonable choice on the upper West Side	The Lucerne makes no attempt to make a statement or have any particular ambience -- it's simply a reasonably dependable hotel with comfortable if small rooms, about 10 blocks north of Lincoln Center. Beds, room furnishings and bathrooms are of high quality, and there are rooms on the back side which are free of street noise (though walls are thin in this older structure, so your neighbors will have something to do with how quiet your room is). Maintenance leaves something to be desired (the TV remote was nonfunctional), as does the somewhat disengaged manner at the front desk. Perhaps the least attractive aspect of the Lucerne is the dated, small lobby, which affords no real place to sit and talk with people you might want to have meet you at the hotel. Next door is a &quot;Nice/Matin&quot;, a bright French bistro -- which is where you'll get coffee in the morning, along with nearby West Siders."
89,1942,"Oct 23 2008 	Comfortable Stay Great Neighborhood	We just returned from a one-week stay at the Lucerne. My husband, adult child and I stayed in a King Suite, which provided sufficient and comfortable space for all. The sitting room has a queen sized sofa that folds out into a comfortable bed; the bedroom with a very comfy king size bed. The kitchenette is a microwave and a mini-fridge and a counter with a single serve coffee pot - more than enough in a city with so many dining options.We requested a renovated room, which was nicely decorated and spotless. (I believe they are working from the lower floors up as they renovate rooms.) Front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming, checkout was quick. Concierge service excellent. Plush bathrobes in the rooms should you require them. Water pressure excellent, spotless bathroom, Temple toiletries provided, a good strong hair dryer. Your choice of New York Times or USA Today in the mornings. It was a pleasant and comfortable spot to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. We enjoyed the upper west side neighborhood, with its numerous restaurants and &quot;neighborhoody&quot; feel, with folks pushing strollers and walking their dogs, lots of little shops and restaurants. The subway is only one block away so we had easy access to any part of the city. It was an easy walk across Central Park in the morning to the east side museums and shopping; Central Park is only a few blocks from the hotel. Great for runners.Minor quibble: we were never left sufficient coffee pods to make three cups of coffee in the AM (single serve coffemaker). Srange since the number of occupants was obvious, and we requested extra pods on two different days (once at front desk, once via call to housekeeping). A minor problem, but when paying full rack rate for an entire week somewhat annoying.We would definitely stay here again. So much nicer than lodging in the more congested areas of the city, and a lovely hotel to boot."
90,1942,"Oct 15 2008 	Loved the Lucerne--again!	We were at the Lucerne for a third visit in September, and then again, overnight on the way back from Europe, two weeks later. As always, it was a welcome place to come back to--comfortable, quiet, convenient to restaurants, ATM, subway, Duane-Reade; everything a visitor needs while traveling. We love the suites for longer stays, but I can recommend the queen rooms, too. The concierge is always helpful--even called us at home before the trip to ask if there was anything she could do.As far as street noise (another reviewer), we've had no problem, but have always stayed on the sixth floor or above at our request."
91,1942,"Oct 14 2008 	Mixed Blessings	Weekend stay in a Non-smoking King Suite. The size of the two rooms with full bath and mini-kitchen was wonderful. Flat panel TVs in both bedroom and living room (remote did not work in the living room). Despite being on the 9th floor the street noise was unacceptable due to one of three windows having no ability to screen or filter the noise (the other two windows were better). The hotel hall ways and the room had mild, persistent ODD ODORS! The staff were subdued and while competent not friendly or in any way disposed to &quot;go the extra mile&quot; as on experiences at other hotels and resorts. The associated restaurant food was o.k. but rendered one of us ill in a manner that raised suspicion for food poisoning. The food was average flavor. OVERALL: NOT worth the money. Would much rather have spent the money for a known product even if added a couple of bucks to the cab rides I had to take."
92,1942,"Oct 7 2008 	A Wonderful Hotel on the Upper West Side	My husband and I, plus my 94-year old father-in-law recently enjoyed a great stay at the Lucerne. The location is perfect for anyone who wants to be close to Central Park, great restaurants and deli's, and eclectic shopping. It's an easy cab ride to the Theatre District and the closest subway stop is a block away. The hotel is in a lovely heritage building. The rooms are on the small side, but very comfortable and nicely furnished. My father-in-law stayed in a room equipped for people with disabilities - it met our expectations except for the lack of grab bars in the accessible shower. My husband and I were upgraded to a suite (at no extra charge) which included a little kitchenette area, a sitting area and a bedroom. Nice additional touches include your choice of newspaper in the morning and spa-quality toiletries. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant attached to the hotel (Nice Matin) is very good - we only had breakfast there but can attest to a wide selection of well-prepared breakfast fare. We drove into Manhattan with our rental car and then dropped it off at a conveniently located Avis, just around the corner from the hotel. We picked up another rental from Avis when we left Manhattan for upstate New York."
93,1942,"Sep 12 2008 	truly wonderwful	My husband and I stayed in the Lucerne for 4 nights in August.The hotel is relatively small but the atmosphere is nice.We got there just around noon because we came from a cross-Atlantic flight and immigration and customs was so quick and easy and the cab driver found a quick route.The room was not ready, but they stored our luggage and allowed us to come back at 2 instead of 4 to check in.The room on the 4th floor had 2 double beds which was excellent for us. The decor of the room was really, really nice and we felt at home right away.The closet was big enough for all our suitcases and had a safe included.The bathroom had no window but a well working vent so that didn't matter. The vent turned on with the light, but you could also turn on the light without vent, so you could also be in silence.The big flat screen TV worked fine.The room was really large and had 3 chest of drawers (9 spacious drawers in total) plus a desk with desk chair. The AC worked really well, too and wasn't too noisy.There is no minibar/ fridge in the room, but signs said there is ice and vending on the 5th and 11th floor - we never used those.From the 9 hotels we stayed in on this trip this was by far the nicest.Eating is really easy, too. Unless you like French cuisine in taste and price, avoid the Nice Matin. We wanted to eat there, but a look on the menu on the side door entering the restaurant from the hotel put us off.We ate a bagel at the Ottomanelli brothers across the street - best bagels of the trip! Once we went to Times Square (Evergreen's just off of Times Square was excellent). Once we went to Mc Donalds which was the worst choice. The last day we went down to Broadway and up two blocks to the nicest restaurant which I forgot the name of.For dinner we can recommend the restaurant which must be at the corner of W 82nd and Broadway which I forgot the name of also. It is partly glass on the sidewalk, you can't miss it. They have the best American (and Jewish) food and the waiter was extremely nice. All other nights we ate in town, but nothing remarkable at that time (Ruby Tuesdays on Times Square and Dean's Second Ave near E 42nd were great at a later stay).But you will find plenty of restaurants of all tastes and bars in the area, so it is nice to just have to walk back to the hotel at night. Across the street is a small duane reade pharmacy, which provides you with snacks, drinks and other things you might have left at home. The next metro station is just down the street on the same block. Takes 1 minute in the morning and 3 at night when you walk up exhausted from the day's fun and adventure.The area felt very safe, we never encountered the slightest problem.The doormen were always at the door, but you had no security checks or such things.The housekeeping did a good job and we had a nice stay all along, including the Concierge getting us an Airport shuttle last minute and the receptionists accepting international mail at the front desk to mail for us.This is a definite &quot;We will be back&quot; in this hotel!"
94,1942,"Sep 9 2008 	Great Hotel Fabulous Location	Spent a great long weekend at this lovely hotel. Rooms were tiny (typical for NYC) but were recently renovated. There are tons of small restaurants and shops in the surrounding area and Central Park is only a few blocks away. Be sure to shop the price - we had to move our reservation back by one week and the price per night almost doubled. Still, it was worth the money. Try &quot;Good Enough to Eat&quot; - about a block away for breakfast or lunch."
95,1942,"Sep 3 2008	Fantastic hotel!	We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Lucerne and it was absolutely perfect. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel is beautiful, and the location is excellent. There is a subway stop just one block away, and many destinations, restaurants, shops and Central Park are within an easy walking distance. The hotel is located in a very safe, family-friendly neighborhood. I shared a one room double with my daughter, and the room was really nice, clean, quiet and comfortable. We were thrilled with our decision to stay there and will most definitely return!"
96,1942,"Aug 31 2008 	great location	We spent 4 nights at the Lucerne, our first ever stay in new York. We had a suite, giving us a small sitting room, which was great, and well worth the extra expense (2 parents, 2 teenage daughters). It was really clean and comfortable, but the best thing was the location, just 3 blocks from Central Park and the tour bus pick-up outside the Natural History Museum. It was also near a subway station, with just a few stops to Times Square. The breakfasts (15% off at the attached restaurant) were lovely, and offered a good variety, ranging from fruit to the New York Heartattack! When we needed a taxi, the doormen were great at finding one, and it was very reasonable. On a wider front, we loved New York, and were amazed at how clean everywhere was, and how friendly everyone was. Oh, and recommend the Chicago Uno Grill, near the Museum, for meals."
97,1942,"Aug 30 2008 	A wonderful experience - again!	Our family of 4 with 2 children ages 5 and 8 stayed at the Lucerne in August for 2 nights. We usually go to NYC every 1-2 years for vacation and we have always stayed at this hotel. This was our 4th visit. The room had been recently renovated. Service was excellent. The location is great for our itinerary since we walked to everything - the American Museum of Natural History, Central Park and Central Park Zoo, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Children's Musuem of Manhattan, and Times Square. We go to H and H Bagels, Zabar's, Patsy's, and Celeste all of which are within a 5 to 10 minutes walk. We almost didn't book the hotel due to the cost but we were able to get a reasonable rate since it was August. We are now spoiled and my husband doesn't want to stay anywhere else! PS For those of you with kids there is a Wild West themed playground for kids about 2-3 blocks south on Amsterdam."
98,1942,"Aug 25 2008 	Recommend this hotel - great location and good rooms	Two of us stayed a week and enjoyed the hotel immensely. We had spent a fair amount of time reading reviews and learning about NYC before selecting the Lucerne for: (1) suite with the kitchenette (so we could spend all day out without having to go hunting for a restaurant every evening), (2) location - residential not touristy, near subway, bus, Central Park, museum mile, Zabar's deli. A bonus was to discover that the Upper West Side has become more fashionable lately and there are lots of lively restaurants/bars on Amsterdam, right round the corner. The a/c was fine and it was a bonus to be able to open room windows. There was very little traffic noise on 12th floor. The toilet did block twice but they cleared it promptly.Zabar's deli on 80th and Broadway is a delight. You can buy very good quality food here (for self-preparation as well as made dishes) - enough for your stay. But there's also plenty of nearby places for all meal types. We went mainly for the art galleries - the Met Museum is very good value - we spent two days there; MoMA is also very good but the Guggenheim is over-rated for its content.We found the staff to be pleasant, efficient and courteous without being overbearing.Altogether an excellent place to stay in NYC!"
99,1942,Aug 11 2008 	Great stay!	We stayed in Lucerne for three days. Experience and service was very good and we can warmly recommend the hotel for families that are visiting New York.
100,1942,"Aug 8 2008 	Excellent Hotel on the Upper West Side	This is a great hotel on the Upper West Side, and excellent value for money. It's within easy reach of the main attractions as there's a metro stop a block away, and Central Park and the Museum of Natural History are just a couple of blocks away. The Hotel is clean and beautifully furnished, we stayed in the smallest/cheapest grade of room (queen) and it was still a very reasonable size for a city. I couldn't fault anything about this hotel, and I would highly recommend staying here on a trip to NYC!"
101,1942,"Aug 8 2008 	Lucerne is a MUST STAY	I just came back from a 5 day stay from NYC and I must say that all the positive reviews about the Lucerne are absolutely correct! The front desk staff are very polite and efficient at their job. They answered our questions about travelling around the city very quickly and had great recommendations for diners and restaurants nearby. Knowing that Manhattan hotel rooms can be on the smallish side I was happily surprised with the size of the Queen superior room. The whole room was tidy and the bathroom was super clean. The room even has an umbrella that you can borrow (just don't lose it or you'll have to pay $25). The only minor negative things about the room is the noise of the air conditioner and the bright light of the clock on the night stand (which I covered with a magazine).The location is also fantastic because it's away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, close to the subway (1 block west is 79th station on the red line), Central Park and numerous affordable and name brand shops, grocery stores (Fairways, Zabars) and restaurants (Ruby Foo's, Beard Papa, Manhattan Diner). As well I felt quite safe walking back to the hotel late at night. From now on I'll definitely stay at the Lucerne every time I go to NYC!"
102,1942,Aug 6 2008	I enjoyed it alot felt european	I stayed in this hotel from the 29th of july till the 1st of Auguste i enjoyed it alot had lots of fun the rooms where nice and clean could int of bin better. The service was nice and the beds where also nice. The room had good air conditioning the area around us was nice alot of pretty ladys and international people witch was cool. over all i liked it.
103,1942,"Aug 5 2008 	Solid choice	The Lucerne is a fairly small 13-story Manhattan hotel on the upper west side. Though I was prepared to have to store our luggage, the front desk greeted our family warmly and got us into our room shortly after our lunchtime arrival. They noted our request for a high room with a view out the front and gave us what we had asked for. We had a small suite with two queen beds and a sitting room with sofa bed, micro-wave, refrig, toaster etc. The decor was not trendy but very clean and well maintained, with good mattresses, linens, robes etc. The staff was really the highlight - front desk totally service-oriented, good security, excellent concierges. The price was hard to swallow at $410 but with the kitchenette, we brought food from the many markets and delis in the area and avoided continual restaurant meals which was fun and saved a little money. The upper west side location is a favorite of ours, as it feels more like a neighborhood. There is a subway stop at the next corner, and walks to Central Park and museums are easy. You might quiz the front desk of their renovation program which I understand is working its way up the building. It was up to the third floor this summer. I prefer higher rooms to ease any noise problems, and though our room was not just renovated, we had no complaints at all. The hotel totally met our needs as a family, and, If we can afford it, the Lucerne will remain our choice of Manhattan lodging."
104,1942,"Aug 3 2008 	We Loved the Lucerne!	We just came back from a 5 night stay at the Lucerne. We absolutely loved this hotel. We knew we made the right choice when Liz, the concierge, called a week prior to see if we needed anything. She arranged for car service to and from the airport. Everyone, from the doorman to the front desk, was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our room. We were on the 9th floor looking out at Amsterdam and 79th Street. The beds were comfy and the shower was fantastic! There were 2 adults and 2 children (ages 9 and 12) and we had plenty of room. We were convenient to Central Park, AMNH and the subway line. We liked not being in the hustle and bustle of the Times Square area. We will definitely stay here again!"
105,1942,"Aug 2 2008	great fit	My family and I (2 adults and 2 young kids) just spent the night there after attending a sporting event in NYC. It was perfect for us. We had a room with two double beds. The room was nice, very clean and quiet. Considering the price...the Lucerne is great!"
106,1942,"Jul 25 2008 	Great service at the Lucerne	We recently spent three nights at the Lucerne. From the outset, the staff were consistently efficient, very helpful and extremely pleasant. Friendly in a non-obsequious way.The room was smallish, yet clean and extremely quiet for a hotel of this size and in a city as noisy as New York.If you are looking for the upper West side, the Lucerne is a good choice."
107,1942,"Jul 22 2008	A big hotel with small hotel charm	I did extensive research before booking the Lucerne, and I don't think I could have made a better choice. The location is great--a quick walk to Central Park, less than a block from the subway line, close proximity to two bagel stores and Zabar's, and the ambience of a European hotel with the amenities of a chain. Although my family of four did not spend much time in our room, we found it spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable -- and we were on the third floor. We wandered all over NYC during the day, but returned in the evening to try out the different restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (not including the attached restaurant, Nice Matin, which seemed pretty expensive). The front desk staffers were invariably pleasant and helpful. This hotel is truly a gem, and at $220 night (plus state room tax, city room tax, occupancy tax, and hotel unit fee...sigh) an outstanding bargain."
108,1942,"Jul 21 2008 	Good location small rooms 	We stayed at the hotel during the NYC Triathlon. We loved the proximity to the race start, and the great Italian restaurant across the street called Coppola's. The room was very clean and appeared newly renovated. However, my husband was a bit disappointed with the size of the room. We paid nearly $300 for a &quot;superior queen&quot; room, and promise you that the bed was the size of a full, not a queen! We were also a bit disappointed with the customer service. The in-room safe malfunctioned, and it took 2 phone calls to the front desk before they agreed to send anyone up. Finally, we managed to open it on our own after waiting more than 20 minutes for help to arrive. When we checked out, we asked for printed directions to I-95, which seemed like a normal request. It took the front desk staff more than 10 minutes to locate the directions!Upon arrival to the hotel, we noticed an available street parking spot and grabbed it. It was great to avoid the hefty valet parking fee, and we had no problems with our car all weekend."
109,1942,May 27 2008 	Nice Hotel--some details off	My wife and I stayed recently in a King bed suite. It was very pretty. The furniture is beautiful and the suite is nicely laid out with a bedroom and a separate living room with a bathroom and a small side closet area that also has a dorm sized fridge plus a sink and coffee maker and microwave. The Upper West Side location is very nice especially since we have a daughter living there now. The staff was very professional and friendly and the doormen were great and provide a great element of security to the building.There were some very nice touches like an umbrella and bathrobes in the closet. The coffee maker only makes one cup of coffee at a time and the standard allotment is one filter to make one cup of decaf and one filter to make one cup of regualr which I thought was odd since it's the type of room that would usually have 2 or more guests staying in it. Also the bed had 3 pillows. It seems that if you are going to give people bathrobes and an umbrella that 4 or 5 pillows and 2 filters for regular cofee wouldn't bust the hotel budget. It's easy to ask for more but it would be nicer if they were just there.The biggest disappointment was the movie channel in the living room didn't work. We did inform the front desk but it was never fixed during our time there. This may have been because it was the Memorial day weekend and repair technicians were not available. We had planned on having our daughter come over and pick a movie from the movie channel and watch it in the living room while we had snacks and wine but instead we went out to a movie at the Loews in the neighborhood. If I had known the movie channel wasn't going to work we probably wouldn't have gotten the suite.Overall a nice place but not as much attention to detail as I had expected from other reviews. Next time we visit our daughter we will probably try another hotel like the Excelsior on the Upper West Side for comparison.
110,1942,"May 16 2008 	Loved it	Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Lucerne. If you go with a reasonable expectation (i.e. it is easy to spend a bundle and stay in a slum when it comes to NY), you should not be disappointed. Our room was relatively spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The staff was attentive and courteous. I was there on Mother's Day, and was pleasantly surprised by the reception they had downstairs (champagne and strawberrries, oh yes!) The location is nice too--we were a short walk from Central Park, and close enough to subway stops for this to be convenient. We would definitely stay here again."
111,1942,"May 1 2008 	Loved the Lucerne	My friend and I just spent 2 nights at the Lucerne, a girlfriend's get-away celebrating her upcoming 60th birthday. Our room was lovely, very comfortable, extra pillows and was QUIET (we were on the 9th fl., and didn't hear any noises). The staff was very nice, helpful, polite. The location is great, just a few blocks from Central Park, a pharmacy across the street, etc., nice neighborhood feel. I would definitely stay here again."
112,1942,"Apr 19 2008 	Not perfect but I'd stay there again	I stayed there 3 nights in a Q/Q suite on the 3rd floor. The room was very quiet - faced the back, with view of brick wall. The beds and sheets were very comfortable. The shower was great, with HOT water and a thick terry robe. The rooms were good sized by NY hotel standards. The suite had a microwave, small fridge and coffee maker - all clean with appropriate amenities.The location is excellent. Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance, including Filene's Basement on the block and H&amp;H bagels one block away. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the front desk printed out my boarding pass. A few negative points - turn-down service never arrived on day 2; sections of the (free) NY Times were missing on day 3; the sitting room could use a larger table for eating or working; beware the airport van service the concierge recommends (I had a cursing driver and a decrepit van, my friend's van almost was t-boned when her driver ran a red light). On the whole, though, I'd recommend the hotel, and definitely would stay there again."
113,1942,"Apr 3 2008 	Great time in NY Lucerne Wonderful	We had 3 rooms (5 people) for a 3 night stay in March. The area was fabulous -- much more quiet than around Times Square. Although we didn't ask much of the staff, our room was clean and perfectly acceptable. I'd much rather stay at Boutique hotels than the chains! Breakfast at the adjoining Nice Matin was good but expensive. We could have done better money-wise at a coffee shop but just never bothered to find one. The doormen were always extremely friendly and the front desk efficient. I can't speak to the bed bug issue but we didn't have any problems. There was a rather large roach on the floor one day but it's an old hotel and a big city! We just killed it and left the body for the maid -- and it was handled.We have definitely found a new home for our New York City stays."
114,1942,"Mar 16 2008 	Great Get-Away at the Lucerne	My husband and I just returned from three nights at the Lucerne. This was our fist time staying at the Lucerne, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We found the faded elegance of the Lucerne very charming. Although our room (Queen, superior) was a bit small, the bed was very comfortable and the amenities were in good working order (including in-room wi-fi access). The staff were wonderful - very friendly, accomodating, and helpful. We enjoyed the afternoon &quot;customer appreciation&quot; wine and cheese in the lobby, and we enjoyed breakfast, cocktails and dinner at Nice Matin.Overall, we were very impressed with the Lucerne and we will be visiting again. It is a great location and a very pleasant environment."
115,1942,"Feb 8 2008	Very nice and appropriate	I stayed here two years ago with my family and two children in a suite. It was just OK then - rooms were reasonably sized and clean but carpet was worn out, furnishings a bit outdated, and TV was old with poor reception. But we needed to be on the upper west side and there are not many options. I stayed here again because of location and was pleasantly surprised. The room was renovated, new carpets, nice lighting with dimmers, flatscreen TV, nice furnishings, now a competitive business travel hotel. I would 100% recomend the hotel."
116,1942,"Jan 4 2008 	Would recommend it!	It's a great hotel which I would definitely recommend! Having heard so many horror stories about over-prices and pokey NY hotels, I was so pleased with the Lucerne! It's clean, spacious and quiet, in a great location. The Upper West Side is fab! The beds are amazingly comfortable and all the little extras make it a great 4 star hotel. Don't bother with breakfast at the hotel though, there are lots of cafes and diners along Amsterdam Av which serve great food all day,"
117,1942,"Dec 31 2007	Warning	WARNING - If you make a reservation at The Lucerne Hotel in NY make sure you don't make the reservation with the front desk. Make sure you make it with the 800 number during regular business hours. MAKE sure you get an e-mail confirmation and a confirmation number. If they say they cant give you this information, you probably have reached their front desk. The front desk doesnt have the capability to send e-mail, according to Demaris in their reservations office.MORE IMPORTANTLY if you have to cancel, MAKE sure you call and talk to someone in reservations during normal business hours  NOT the front desk! MAKE sure you get a written confirmation back and a cancellation number! To be safe, I would also suggest that even if you get a confirmation number and written confirmation that you contact the General Manager Douglas Brookman and get a written confirmation from him."
118,1942,"Dec 27 2007 	Fabulous Hotel!	The Lucerene is filled with very pleasant and helpful staff, is very clean and quite roomy for a New York Hotel. We did splurge (although, the &quot;splurge&quot; was about $200.00 less than most of the chain hotels during the holidays in NY) for a King bedroom, but it was well worth it. There was a walk in hallway, decent size bathroom and tons of walking room around the bed between the desk and dresser. If you're in need of a lovely hotel on the upper west side, this is the perfect place to stay!"
119,1942,"Dec 26 2007	Another great stay!	This place just gets better and better. Excellent, friendly and professional staff. Refurbed rooms are brighter and nicer than two years ago. Location a block from the #1 subway and right off Amsterdam with a ton of restaurants. Two blocks to Central Park. We've already booked our stay for next December."
120,1942,"Dec 9 2007	Spectacular stay	We absolutely loved the hotel! We went to celebrate my husband's fortieth birthday, and were instantly upgraded. The rooms were beautifully decorated and spacious by New York standards. The staff was very hospitable and courteous. The subway was situated quite close. The italian restaurant across the street (Coppola's) was excellent! The restaurant downstairs (Nice Matin) was not good- pricey for the quality of the service and quite slow. We ate a good breakfast at Sarabeth's around the corner. Would definitely stay at the Hotel Lucerne again."
121,1942,"Nov 27 2007	LUCERNE HOTEL (near American Museum of Natural History)	four friends - we stayed January 2007 for three nights; 2 queen beds; kitchenette; and living room area; it was great; would definitely recommend hotel; they were running a winter special at the time too, which was good; plus it included a free breakfast at Nice Matin downstairs, excellent; we had a blown fuse with the hairdryer situation; they fixed it immediately; and I mean immediately;"
122,1942,"Nov 27 2007	Great upper west side hotel	Stayed in the Lucerne for two nights in their King Suite. Cannot say enough about the staff, the hotel, and the french cafe next door. This is a find! Not inexpensive but not bad for this time of year. I learned that there are a number of configurations for their deluxe king and double suites. If you like a massive room with desk and bed plus bathroom, the King Suite i had would fit the bill. room 601. however if you would prefer a sitting area separate from the bedroom ask because i looked at a couple with two double beds and a great lounging TV room.All in all a great upper west side hotel."
123,1942,Nov 26 2007 	Great hotel and staff	We stayed at The Lucerne for 4 nights 17-21 November. Rooms are good and clean. Door staff and reception staff could not do enough to help. Near tube and plenty of restaurants. They let us keep a room on the last day until it was time to leave. I can recomend this hotel for a stay in the big apple.
124,1942,"Nov 20 2007 	Great location wonderful doormen!	My friend and I stayed here Nov 2-5 and had a wonderful stay. We booked the deluxe suite through Expedia and were very pleased with our selection. The location can't be beat, we walked everywhere from this upper west side spot, and whenever we had questions on how to get somewhere, the doormen were ready to help. (The rest of the staff was helpful too.)The suite we booked has a small parlor adjoining the Q/Q bedded room, it was nice to have a little more elbow room. We were right across from the elevator but it didn't bother me at all; my roommate is a light sleeper and she slept soundly too with earplugs in. (Thee was more noise coming from the street outside, typical city noises, honking, garbage trucks, etc. but with the windows closed sound wasn't a problem!) Very comfortable beds and charming decor. I would definitely return here."
125,1942,"Oct 17 2007 	This is an excellent hotel:Service location and rooms	My family (2 adults,3 children) just returned from 3 fabulous nights. (October 11-14 2007).I caution anyone reading the negative reviews to have the benefit of a doubt when 'administrative' issues arise, as there are 2 sides to the every story. I had a totally different experience (and I double booked by accident one room, and used their on line system for cancellation).This was my 1st time to this hotel. I've stayed at the Plaza dozens of times (before it closed for remodeling, now several of the x-Plaza staff work at Lucerne) when on business and 2 years ago My wife and I stayed at the Carlyle for our anniversary.I had a good feeling from day 1 when the concierge (Liz and Ari) were so prompt and efficient with recommendations. All their tips were right on: Arrive for Ellis Island early and skip Statue of Liberty (it's only open at base and that requires reservation at least 1 week in advance) and go directly to Ellis Island tour, the red double decker on/off bus tour, restaurants only blocks away.They arrange car service for airport that was prompt going and coming.This hotels excels at service -- when we arrived it was raining and during our short wait for our room to be ready (they were sold out) the doormen were out in the pouring rain in the middle of the street hailing taxi's for waiting guests. Each time as we stepped off the elevator, employee's were asking how they could help us.There are dozens of wonderful neighborhood restaurants in all types of food and price ranges just blocks away. Nice Matin restaurant attached to the hotel is excellent as well. Ocean Grill was excellent (pricy) as was Sushi at Haru. There are 3-4 bagel shops just across the street or 1 block away. Starbucks is 2 blocks.The #1 Subway line is 1 block away. Central Park is 2 blocks. The rooms (2 double beds) are ample sized, as was the bathroom. Ours was very clean. It appears the hotel has been recently completely remodeled and everything (furniture, fixtures, ac.heat units, etc..) was new. The water pressure was really great and plenty of hot water. We got a NY Times at our door each morning.Our room price was 340.00 per night. I suggest you get roomsX01, x03, X19-24 as these are not facing the main streets and are dead quiet. We had 2 rooms and one was on the main street and we were on 3rd floor. The soundproof windows are excellent and even on the lower floor right on the street, there was no adverse street noise. My children told me there was a firetruck blaring at 3 am but my wife and I heard nothing fromour room just down the hall. There are few negatives with this hotel: the lobby is small (but elegant NY style) and can be busy. The maids were late to our room one day and we went for a 15 min. walk and our room was ready. You gotta have a little flexibility in NYC folks!!Please contact me if you have addl. questions./ap"
126,1942,"Oct 17 2007 	LUXUS and Wonderful !!	Wir Hatten Unserem Urlaub in Die USA.... We stayed for a long weekend at the Lucerne Hotel 201 West 79th Str. and our Room (Zimmer) was absolut perferkt for the two of us. Our room (Zimmer) was very clean (sauber) and we have absolut no complaints. The service was also very good. A Door man ( Hausmeister) greeting us each time we come and go... going-- always polite and asking would we need a taxi. The Concierge was absolut helpful and friendly, also drawing little maps (Landkarte), so we may find places, shops, restaurants, ALL with ease. Great location--very close to the Metro (subway) to travel up-town/mid-town/down-town, and the food at the attached restaurant.... name--Nice---was delicious(koestlich)... and SUPER SERVICE from server ( Kellner/in). The room (Zimmer) had Flat screen Television, CD-Radio player, comfortable (gemuetlich) bed/mattress, safe in closet with umbrella ( Regenschirm) if traveler has forgotten. Bathroom (Badezimmer) was small, but all was marble (Marmor), fresh towels/ bath supplies every day. I would like to rate this Hotel Top and give 5 points on all."
127,1942,"Oct 15 2007 	Terrific neighborhood and staff	Second time at Lucerne, tho it's been at least five years since first visit. Happy to note that terrific service I remembered is still the way of the hotel. I love upper west side and hotel's location is great. Rooms are ample by NYC standards. For this visit, stayed in 11th floor room with two double beds and in a suite on 9th floor. Rates are incredibly expensive for the modest level of luxury, but that's the way of the city. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The furnishings are nothing special but do the job. Hotel is in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Shocked to order coffee for two via room service and only be charged $5.50. What a surprise not to be ripped off. The staff is wonderful--from front desk to bellmen. We were able to get help with our bags when we changed rooms mid stay and when we checked out. Hotel also gave us a late check out and kept our bags stashed while we shopped before heading to airport. The Lucerne is proof that good service can enhance an experience tremendously--if it weren't for the staff, I'd give hotel 3 stars."
128,1942,"Oct 5 2007	Not nice! Paid higher rate than quoted.	Was attending a group meeting at Columbia University.The hotel itself is great-location, accomodations, etc.The problem was the management staff-When I was charged the wrong rate ($100 higher per night than quoted) the manager refused to adjust my rate to the group price I had booked. They wouldn't fix my bill, in fact, the billed me twice. It took months to fix this problem. Even though the rest of the staff (doorman, etc) were very helpful and nice, the administrative problems out weigh the good things."
129,1942,"Oct 4 2007 	Great location 	We stayed at the Lucerne for 5 nights at the end of September whilst in NY for our friends wedding. Having just read the last 2 reviews, our experience could not have been more different!We arrived at the hotel early (1pm) to be told our room was ready and we could go straight up. The room itself was large and clean with 2 queen beds. We found the staff to always be very helpful and polite. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every day.The hotel is in a great location. There are tons of restaurants within easy walking distance and its lovely to be so near Central Park. There are obviously far more luxurious hotels in NY, but for a modest amount of money the Lucerne is definitely a good bet."
130,1942,"Oct 1 2007 	Took my wedding guests' money and charged me also	I sent many people to the Lucerne for my wedding weekend. First, they did not have rooms ready until much later than they informed us. Then, they did not honor my cancellation of a room for my mother and charged me. I regularly interacted with the Lucerne regarding my wedding room block. They had my phone numbers, my fiance's numbers, and all of our email addresses. Not only did I call to cancel my mother's room, but they could have contacted me when they realized their computer showed a booking that did not seem to be correct. They chose instead to charge a valued guest. I came back from my honeymoon to their rudeness. Very disappointed."
131,1942,"Sep 27 2007 	So disappointing!	This hotel has gone down hill dramtically in the last few years. It used to be a lovely small hotel on New York's Upper West side. Now I could never recommend it to anyone. On my visit here last April, the management refused to honor an internet reservation despite a confirmation number telling me they were sold out. I was forced to find an alternate hotel iate in the evening.  On this visit, we made the reservation directly with the hotel despite paying much more for the room. When we arrived, we were told out room would be be ready at 4:00 pm and then we waited hours for the room to be available. Had the management told us the truth, we could have gone shopping or sightseeing rather than be stuck in the lobby being told that &quot;any minute &quot; the room would be ready.  Once we we finally did check in, the room and bathroom were filthy and one of the bed was not made. The musty carpet smelled of mildew. When I complained that the room was diirty, we were told that everything else was sold out so there was little that could be done."
132,1942,"Sep 27 2007 	Wonderful large rooms!	The huge room was a pleasant surprise - double the size of most NYC rooms that are more like closets! Very comfortable also - new furnishings, drapes and carpets and a large flat screen tv. Staff was friendly and helpful. Totally recommend this little gem."
133,1942,"Sep 15 2007 	Lucerne a solid 2 1/2 star hotel	I ended up staying at the Lucerne because the Excelsior was booked solid. My room at the Lucerne was clean, quiet,and roomy. The bathroom tiny. The staff friendly. The hotel's location was pretty good. If you are looking for a budget hotel on the UWS the Lucerne is for you. For the same price I'll be by the park at the Excelsior."
134,1942,"Sep 5 2007 	Fantastic!!	We had a wonderful experience at the Lucerne. The hotel is lovely, comfortable and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location can't be beat. We've found our new favorite place to stay in NYC! It is within minutes of Central Park, the Museum of Natural History tons of shops and wonderful restaurants. Our room was also the largest we've ever had in Manhattan, at a very reasonable rate. Kudos to The Lucerne!"
135,1942,"Sep 3 2007 	Even better than the last time	we stayed at The Lucerne in december 2005 and it was fantastic but sometimes when you return to a place it is'nt as good but I am glad to say that was not the case at The Lucerne, we had our 12 year old niece with us and she asked if we could have a high floor and a street view and she was'nt dissappointed. we were on the 10th floor with a view straight up Amsterdam and after about 30 seconds she announced that she was moving to new york !but this is a hotel review and The Lucerne has got even better the decor is fantastic, the rooms, we had a double room, are big enough although a suite would have been better but who spends alot of time in the hotel room !!All of the staff were helpfull and very polite as everyone else has stated and the area is full of restaurants and the subway being so close is a bonus.I can recommend this to anyone and as we left kirby was still counting yellow cabs !!!!!!!!!!!!"
136,1942,"Aug 31 2007 	Great little hotel on West 79th	I was born in NYC and I have high standards for my hotel stays. So when I booked a room at the Hotel Lucerne, I had high expectations. I booked at the Lucerne because of its location just west of Central Park (and a straight shot across the Park to the Metropolitan Museum) and because the price was decent for Manhattan.Overall, my wife and I really enjoyed our stay at the Lucerne. We stayed on the 8th floor; the photos that accompany this review show our west-facing view and the front of the hotel. The bellhops, front desk crew, and concierge are all efficient and friendly...for New York, anyway. I appreciated their efficiency when we arrived in a private car from Long Island; the bellhop took our luggage and silently waited as we checked in. Nice.The hotel elevators are fairly small, but they are manageable. Our 8th floor room was also fairly small, but in terms of Manhattan hotel rooms the size was to be expected. My wife and I found the space to be adequate, although eating a meal in the room was a little tricky. The bathroom is small but it has everything you need. We didn't get a mini-fridge in the room, but when we requested one we quickly got it free of charge.The hotel location is terrific: 1 block from the 1 subway line, 1 block from great bagels at H&amp;H, and less than 1 block from a few restaurants and shops. Taxi service is no problem, particularly with the bellhops and doormen standing by.The room was extremely quiet. I was surprised by how peacefully we were able to sleep in the nice king bed in our room. The 8th floor isn't too high up, but we had a very quiet retreat for a few days there.Minor downsides included a couple of slightly stained towels (quickly and cheerfully replaced) and a window that didn't quite close (no problem, just pulled the drapes). The TV could be newer/sharper, but again that's not a big deal.Overall, I would stay at the Lucerne again. I never even saw the gym on the top floor! The Nice/Matin restaurant is good but a bit expensive...but also very convenient."
137,1942,Aug 29 2007 	Very good hotel	The Hotel Lucerne was ideally situated away from the busy tourist areas but ideally situated for the subway enabling easy access for exploring New York. The staff were friendly and helpful and the concierge was on hand for useful advice. She was able to get us seats for The Jersey Boys which although a little pricey having paid over the odds for them the show was so good that we felt it was worth it for the convenience.Our intial room was changed without any problem due to leaking air condtioning. The restaurant attached to the hotel was reasonably priced for dinner and breakfast. There was also a good choice of eateries surrounding the hotel. An absolute must for a vist is Zabar's which is incredible.A very good place to stay
138,1942,"Aug 27 2007 	quiet and clean	Stayed for four days in August with our two girls, age 6 and 9. Room was cramped but reading reviews should have asked for a larger room. Very clean, quiet and nicely updated, we would definitely stay again both for the hotel, the exceptionally friendly staff and the neighbourhood. We usually stay at the Michaelangelo without kids (fabulous hotel if you can get a good rate) near Times Square but really fell in love with this location. Went for runs in Central park, had breakfast at nearby diners for very reasonable prices.I would stay again but maybe book a larger room than the one we had with 2 double beds."
139,1942,"Aug 24 2007	Very nice away from midtown tourist lunacy	I've stayed at the Lucerne 5 times in the last 4 years. ..and it just gets better.First, the location on the Upper Westside is so much nicer than the Midtown regular tourist haunts. It's unfathomable why anyone would choose to stay in the Midtown theater district. The hotel is only a few blocks from Central Park, a few blocks the other way from the Hudson River, a nice walk to Lincoln Center - and around the corner from Zabar's and H&amp;H Bagel!!! The rooms are all very nice - BUT they do vary considerably in size. The first time I stayed (with my wife and 2 sons), the room was pretty cramped. Last month (July 2007) the room on a higher floor was huge - by NYC standards.The attached restaurant, Nice Matin, is pretty good, but with so many restaurant choices nearby, a bit superfluous."
140,1942,"Aug 22 2007 	Location can't be beat	We are a family with 2 teenagers so a spacious room was a priority. We stayed in the king suite and it was perfect for us. The air conditioner worked great. The toilet handle was tricky, you just have to push down hard. The location, the upper west side, was super -- the hotel is surrounded by restaurants, many of which offer outdoor dining. There are grocery stores, drug stores, a department store and small shops all around the area. The Lucerne is one block from the 1,2,3 line. We went all around Manhattan and it was so nice to come back to the relative quiet of this part of NYC. The hotel staff is very nice. The business center is undergoing renovation so we could not use its computers but the front desk did print out some documents for us at our request. We booked tickets to the Museum of Natural History through the concierge and she was very helpful and even alerted us that the subway schedule changes on the weekend. We would have really been confused if we hadn't been clued in! We would absolutely stay here again!"
141,1942,"Aug 20 2007 	Loved the Lucerne - Great for Families!	The Lucerne is a lovely, small boutique hotel on the Upper West Side two blocks from Central Park and the Museum of Natural History. The subway and bus stop are both within a block's walking distance. The location is fabulous! Liz, the concierge, was very helpful with directions and recommendations. The rest of the hotel staff was wonderful. We stayed for over a week and couldn't have been happier. The Nice Matin next door is great for a late night dinner after a show."
142,1942,"Aug 19 2007	Highly Recommend the Lucerne	We read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this hotel before booking and it certainly lived up to the praise! The location is superb -- just two block from the park in a nice part of the West Side. The rooms are roomy for NYC, the staff was exceptionally friendly, and the rates were quite reasonable. The rooms were recently re-modeled and were clean. We have nothing negative to say and would highly recommend it. Don't forget to ask for AAA rates."
143,1942,"Aug 16 2007 	New York Hotel Highlight	The hotel really lives up to the description on it's own website. Located in Upper West Side it is 5 minutes from the Museum of Natural History in one direction and 5 minutes from Riverside Park in the other.The Nice Matin restuarant is fantastic and busy with well heeled locals and guests alike. The whole area has plenty of good restuarants though more for adults and older children than little ones.Whilst seemingly out of the madness of NYC it is easily accessible by Subway (end of the street - 10 mins to Times Square), by Bus (outside the door - 15 mins to 5th Avenue) and of course by Yellow Cab. This is a real blessing in that you can get peace and quiet late at night and can step out on to a clear sidewalk rather than the madness of some hotels around the tourist spots.As for New York - fantastic!! If you want a real view go to the top of the Rockefeller - half the price/queuesof the Empire State and twice the view. If you want an emotional experience go to the WTC 9/11 Tribute Centre - I defy you not to have a tear in your eye whilst your there."
144,1942,"Aug 11 2007 	Lucerne was okay	Just got back from a weeks stay at the Lucerne. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk was very nice. I had booked a double queen suite and asked for a quiet room on arrival. Was given a room on the 3rd floor in the back- no view but very quiet- until Monday when we found that several of the rooms next to ours were being renovated- as in gutted. Electric saws and hammering and the smell of paint. Now the front desk did offer to move us but since it meant repacking everything( I had unpacked everything since it was so quiet on Sun.) we decided to stay put. . We were usually out of the room during the day and the work stopped at 5pm. Just wish we had been informed before hand that there was construction. The beds were very comfortable, we all slept great. Air conditioner worked very well. Had no problems w the internet service. The sitting room was quite small and only had 2 chairs. The bathroom was small but not tiny. Maid service was spotty,the floor was not vacuumed the entire week, toiletries such as soap were not always replaced. The location can't be beat- close to subway, lots of restaurants and I felt very safe. I would stay again but would make sure that my room was not near any renovations"
145,1942,"Aug 10 2007 	Great place at a reasonable price close to subway	My daughter and I just got back from an overnight shopping trip in NYC and found this reasonable hotel recommended by TripAdvisor reviewers. It seems like all our other favorite hotels are up to $450 a night and we just did not want to shell out that much. With tax, our room at the Lucerne was $298 and just fine. We liked it very much. The room was clean and comfortable and very convenient to the subway. Our ninth floor double queen room was quiet (!) and beds comfortable. The adjoining restaurant was very nice. It's a great alternative to the fluffy robe and minibar type hotel."
146,1942,"Aug 7 2007 	Great Hotel for a Great Price	We loved our stay at the Lucerne. We arrived early (11am) and they had a room available for us to check-in to, which was great. The room was beautifully decorated. Not huge, but adequate for ourselves and teeenage son, and hey this is New York. The bedsheets were changed everyday, if you require them to be done, and Fresh toiletries and towels put out. Small charge applies to use the business internet room but it is very handy to check on flights etc. Lady in reception very helpful and will book theatre tickets and provide advice on where to eat etc. She also confirmed our Shuttle Bus for our return to JFK.Couldn't fault the hotel and would definitely recommend to friends.The location on the Upper West side we found great. Away from the hustle and bustle of Mid and Down Town - which were a short and convenient underground journey away. Also short walk to Central Park.The area around the Lucerne is fairly residential, with lots of restaurants and bars. No shortage of choice. Also if you turn right out of the hotel, and walk down to the Hudson River, there is a fantastic bar/restaurant, with great atmosphere, down by the river - well worth walking down to, to watch the sun go down.We had a fantastic stay in New York and would recommend the ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island (hire the headphones, well worth it). Also take free ferry to Staten Island if only for the views of Statue of Liberty and Manhatten."
147,1942,"Aug 4 2007 	Perfect Choice	The Lucerne turned out to be the perfect choice for my four day stay in Manhattan. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Above all, I truly enjoyed the accommodations. I am a light and restless sleeper, and fret about that at every hotel I stay. Yet I slept soundly every night with no disturbances of any kind. The room was big enough for the solo traveler (and two people would also be very comfortable). The bed and bathroom were of great quality, and the AC kept the room as chilly as I desired. Had a view of the Hudson (took a photo of the big red sun setting over the river from my window).Conveniently located in the Upper West side, I walked everywhere each day: one block from the Museum of Natural History, two blocks from Central Park, seven blocks from Strawberry Fields and the Imagine mosaic; an easy stroll across the park to the Met, Frick, Guggenheim. I even walked through the park to midtown sites as well (Radio City, Rockfeller Center, MoMA). Broadway is also only a block away. The cab ride from and to Penn Station was effortless and inexpensive. I enjoyed a delicious and relaxing dinner every evening at restaurants only a block or two from the hotel (and a nice breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Nice Matin).Some sites give the Lucerne 2 stars, others 3. I would gladly award it 3 stars; I have stayed in many US cities at hotels claiming to be 3 stars and mostly have been disappointed. For New York, the price was a good deal (I booked end of July-early Aug). I plan to make the Lucerne my regular hotel for all future visits. I commend the management and staff."
148,1942,"Aug 3 2007	Great location!	We were pleasantly surprised by this wonderful gem of a hotel. We have been to New York before and stayed at a hotel near the kaos of Time Square. The Lucerne was definitey a better choice. The Lucerne was clean, very comfortable and close to great restaurants, subway, Central Park, Museums, and Riverside Park. It was pleasure coming home in the evening after a hectic day of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The Lucerne would certainly be the choice of hotel the next time we visit New York."
149,1942,"Aug 2 2007 	Sublime Relaxation Retreat while in town for the NY Bar Exam	In town to take the the New York Bar Exam, I wanted a quiet retreat where I could get some quality sleep, relax, be close to transportation, and be far away from honking horns, frantic tourists while enjoying some local flavors. I got all of these things from my stay at The Lucerne, and at a great bargain of a price! There is impeccable customer service here--hotel porters, elevator operators, front desk, cleaning service--all very polite and helpful, but also easily avoidable if you are feeling anti-social or particularly independent (e.g., don't need someone to hail you a cab). I got the smallest cheapest room, and I was wowed by the size of the room and bathroom (huge for Manhattan!). Very clean, and luxurious. Flat screen TV, plush pillows. Courtesy umbrella in the closet came in handy. Combination safe in room. In my dazed and confused state after taking the 2-day bar exam, I ended up having a major crisis after I had already checked out and left town. I called the hotel and spoke to the manager (Dexter), who was extremely courteous and helpful, and resolved my dilemma with the utmost care. Food - Nice Matin, the restaurant next door, is OK, but a bit pricey, even with the hotel discount, and better food can be had all along Broadway or Amsterdam within walking distance. You can take 10 steps further from Nice Matin and have a world of options at your fingertips. Zabar's is right down the block on Broadway. Tasty local eats less than a 2-minute walk away on Amsterdam abound (Chinese, Indian, diners, South American, fusion, etc). Necessities - Duane Reede right across the streetTransportation - 1 Train is very close (this was a major factor for me, as I hate walking more than 1 long block and 1.5 short blocks to the subway); taxis on Broadway or Amsterdam readily hailableAlso, there are a bunch of stores on Broadway, if you have some time to kill - Filene's Basement, Sephora, Staples, etc. Cons - wireless internet is not free (but is only about $5.95 for entire duration of stay). Business Center is a rip-off (something like 30cents/min to get online). Restaurants listed in the hotel guide provided in the room are a poor representation of what is really available right outside the hotel! Toiletries were exceptionally odiferous and a bit masculine in scent."
150,1942,"Jul 31 2007 	Great hotel	Friendly, clean, quiet, lovely, convenient. Great NY Hotel. Very convenient to subway. . Would definetly stay again. Only complaints are the pillows are very uncomfortable and lumpy and could not get extra set of sheets although I had asked for three days in a row."
151,1942,"Jul 23 2007 	Great hotel and location !	Hotel was excellent. Great staff, lovely lobby and the room while small, was very nice --very comfy beds (we had 2 doubles)Hotel is in a great location, next door to Filenes Basement, 1 block from the subway which takes you direcly to theatre district. Nice Italian restaurant (Coppolas) right across the street, along with 24 hour Duane Reed pharmacy. Try Zabars (around the corner on Broadway) for breakfast. Would highly recommend this hotel"
152,1942,"Jul 20 2007 	Beautiful Establishment	My stay at the Lucerne went well the establishment was beautiful and even though it was expensive it was not too expensive for the city.. There was only a few issues I had with the room and that was just that the toilet in room 324 was a pain to flush.. The suction was not all that great.. There was a couple of times where I had to go back in and flush it again.. There was also a lack of trash cans the only trash can was located in the bathroom.. I just started using extra plastic bags that I had to contain the garbage no one likes things hanging around yuck.. Also I found a cork screw in the cabinet that still contain the cork still on it.. I presume that they could not get the cork off and no one noticed it but I made sure to place it in eyesight so that way the could either have the cork removed or the cork screw replaced, but otherwise from the front desk, bellman and housekeeping were very nice and friendly.. I definitely would consider staying there again.."
153,1942,"Jul 1 2007 	What a dump!	We chose this hotel because of the location (we have family on the upper west side), and we were somewhat hopeful given the reviews we read. The lobby is nice and so is the staff, but the room was horrible. I think I've read that the hotel has undergone a renovation, but maybe they haven't progressed to the suites yet because the furnishings for the room were definitely shabby. But, given that the hotel is reasonably priced we didn't really care about that. We are a family of 5 (three young children) and needed to use the sofabed. When we pulled it out we found that the upper third of the bed tilted in toward the floor and was unusuable. Since it was late at night and our children were already asleep, we had to fit all of us in the king bed. Not so comfortable. Also that night, my husband went to turn on a light, and the lightswitch shattered leaving shards all over the floor. The next morning we took showers and noticed black hair all over the tub (we're blond) and the tub backed up.  In addition to that, the mini refrigerator would only shut if you kicked it hard back into its slot.Needless to say we were less than pleased. We packed up our stuff and got a room at the Mandarin Oriental (absolutely amazing).In addition, when I spoke to the the desk manager about all of this, I didn't get much reaction (not even a &quot;sorry about that&quot;), just asked if I wanted another room. So, while the staff was nice, I wouldn't rate them as excellent.I know many people give this hotel great reviews, but it didn't happen for us."
154,1942,"Jun 26 2007	Excellent stay!	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lucerne Hotel. It was a pleasure to return there each evening after three busy days exploring NYC. Our room (double queen for 2 adults, 2 children) was comfortable, reasonably sized, super clean, and quiet. The staff were friendly and the doormen even managed to elicit a smile from our extra shy 8 year-old. We had a very good dinner at the hotel's Nice Matin and dessert at Grom gelato on Broadway. We also had a great lunch at the Funky Diner. Perfect in every way!"
155,1942,"Jun 25 2007	Great Place!	No problems at all. Room was larger than I expected because everyone always talks about NYC having small rooms. The Conceierge (Liz) was very helpful. She can sell you discounted tickets to anywhere. It's only 1 block from the subway so it's very easy to get around. Also, I just received my credit card statement and they did not post any unexpected charges on my card. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone."
156,1942,"Jun 22 2007 	I'd stay here again...	We just stayed here while we attended a conference in the city. We had 2 rooms for four co-workers. The hotel itself is very lovely. Both of our rooms were recently renovated and they were beautiful.It was VERY clean, beds were comfy and service was good. We did have to change rooms due to the air conditioning breaking down one night though.It was in a good location and was close to a subway station and a lot of restaurants and shopping."
157,1942,"Jun 2 2007 	Great experience	This hotel was selected for me for a conference I attended. I found it very pleasant. I had a single room with a queen bed. The room was in back facing some other buildings, yet it had a nice window and was very pleasant. The room was smaller than a motel room but otherwise not small at all. It was well decorated and the bathroom was lovely. The amenities (bed, pillows, towels, TV, etc.) were slightly above average. The location was excellent, a two block walk to Central Park, a block from Zabar's, with many good eateries in the area. The staff were noticeably pleasant and attentive. Overall this hotel had a charming, high-class feel and I would return anytime if the price is right."
158,1942,"Jun 1 2007 	Comfortable Cozy and Great Value	I would just like to add my praise for this hotel along with the rest written here.My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in the end of May 2007.As neither of us had ever travelled to NYC before, we were keen to find somewhere to stay that was clean, comfortable, convenient, safe, and not too straining on the budget.We stumbled upon this hotel whilst surfing the net and thought it sounded too good to be true, however, after reading multiple reviews on this site we decided to go ahead and book.We were not disappointed in the slightest. In fact, we were thrilled.We found the Lucerne to be everything it promised.We stayed in a superior queen room and, although it was fairly small, it was well laid out and functional. The furnishings chosen for the room were elegant and made us feel like we were staying in a much more expensive hotel. We were on the 11th floor. Traffic noise was present but bearable however, the room had the tendency to get quite hot if the air conditioner was not turned on (even when the outside air temp was not particularly hot).All staff were friendly and helpful and sounded as though they knew exactly what they were doing (I know this is what you would always hope for, however, in my experience it is unfortunately not terribly common). At some points they went above and beyond the call of duty (eg the bell boy took the time to explain to us the ins and outs of how Manhattan was laid out and how the streets were named without being asked... invaluable abvice!)We found its proximity to the subway to be terrific - very easy to get around anywhere and everywhere we wanted to go.Good concierge service, although we did find ourselves being talked into spending a bit more money than what we had planned for city tours etc (mind you, these were well worth the money...would thoroughly recommend the double decker sight seeing hop on, hop off busses for anyone who has never been to NYC before and wants to see everything there is to see in a short amount of time).We utilised the wireless internet service which was good for us and not terribly expensive (although, beware, once you have used it you will be billed per night for the rest of your stay, so if you were only planning on using it for one quick time on the first night of your week long stay and then not again, this could get quite expensive).All in all we were extremely happy with everything about our stay at the Lucerne and would have no hesitations recommending it to others or, if we ever return, staying there again."
159,1942,"May 28 2007	Great location quiet hotel	If you need lodging on the upper westside of New York, this is a great hotel in a great location. The subway stop is at the end of the block. There are lots of restaurants nearby. The location is between Central Park and Riverside Park if you want a nice place to walk or for the kids to play. We had a room with two double beds that was a good size. It was not the tiny room you get so often in NYC. And it was quiet! We had a corner room but traffic and city noise was not a problem. We barely heard people in the hall or neighboring rooms. We did not eat at the restaruant but it looked very nice and always had a good crowd. The staff was very courteous and attentive. It was pricey but still less than other hotels we considered in the same area. Every hotel seemed to go up in time for college graduations!"
160,1942,"May 20 2007 	An elegant mid-budget choice	This is an elegant little hotel. My room on the 12th floor looked like it had been recently renovated. It looked out over Amsterdam Avenue (at the back of the hotel), but because it was so high up, I wasn't bothered by noise. Natural light filled the room, and even though it wasn't large, it felt airy.The attached restaurant, Nice Matin, seems popular with the locals. Hotel guests can access it straight from the lobby. I had both dinner and breakfast there and was not disappointed. I didn't get to try the other neighborhood restaurants, but there seems to be no shortage of good places to eat.This is not a budget hotel, but neither is it overpriced for what you get. I would describe it as an excellent mid-budget choice, and I would definitely stay here again."
161,1942,"May 9 2007 	I hate hotels that lie to me	So I'm staying here at the Lucerne, which is a reasonably nice hotel for New York. The rooms are small but comfortable. But it's the first really warm days of May, and the staff is completely incompetent when it comes to the air conditioning.The first night, I call to say the AC is not working. A guy comes up, fiddles with it, and it works. For 2 minutes. Then it goes off and never comes back on, and the room is sweltering all night.The next morning I ask the desk to fix the AC, and the desk clerk gives me some complete load of hooey about how the water tank on the roof has been drained and there's no AC in the building. I tell him that I had AC for two minutes last night and he's completely bulls***ing me.Same thing last night. The maintenance guy comes in, says only turn it to cold 3/4 of the way, and then it'll be fine. Nope, 2 minutes later it goes off and never comes back on.Now I've got ANOTHER maintence guy here. He says everything is fine. But it isn't as my room is 85 degrees.What a load of junk. I would love this hotel, if they didn't lie to me, and if they could figure out how to fix their air conditioning."
162,1942,"May 7 2007 	Totally Miranda!	The Lucerne is a beautiful property, in a great location, with friendly, helpful people. I recommend it highly. I had never stayed on the Upper West Side. I usually stay mid-town, but my last experience (at the Warwick) was so deafeningly loud I decided to try something new. It was totally Miranda (as is Sex in the City)! The Upper West Side is a completely different experience!The Lucerne is a find. And I'm glad I found it.I spent 9 days in room 815. My room was not large but completely remodeled with a flat screen TV and a good size writing desk. The bed was very comfortable. The window opened. The bathroom was enormous. Everything was clean, clean, clean. The housekeeper was very attentive. The bellman were very helpful. The 8th floor is beingrenovated so there was a little construction noise but it was limitedto after 9 am (time to get up!) and everyone went home at 5 pm so thenights were very quiet.The only negative experience I had was with the room service. It wasn't the price of the hamburger that offended me and it came fairly fast. It was the quality. One of the worst burger's I've ever had. Bland, undercooked and generally bad. And the fries were even worse. Not good.The property itself is a block away from one subway line (1,2 &amp; 3) and three blocks from a completely different line (A, B, C &amp; D). The crosstown bus (the one that takes you to the Met) is across the street. Public transportation in New York has come a long way - I never once took a cab - buses and subway all the way.I had a great trip - I'd recommend the Lucerne to everyone. Most importantly, I'll stay there again."
163,1942,"Apr 4 2007 	Great place to stay	My daughter and I stayed at the Lucerne, for our first visit to NY. We found our recently renovated room to be big enough for us and very modern. There was a flat screen tv, and the bathoom was spotless. There was no noise from outside at night, but some renovation noise during the day. Ask for a room on a floor that has completed the makeover. The staff and doormen were very friendly and helpful. We did not understand the subway and each morning the conceirge would write down our travel plans and guide us to where we were going. Since the stop is just on the corner, coming back late at night was not a problem. This help greatly! There are great restaurants in the neighborhood and we felt very safe. The Ocean Grill at the end of the street had outdoor seating and awsome seafood. There is a drugstore acroos the street for all the things you forgot, including snacks for your room. We will return to NY and stay here again."
164,1942,"Mar 7 2007 	Upper West Side in the middle of the action	I would up at The Lucerne at the last minute after a booking problem with another hotel. Therefore, I probably paid top dollar for my room, and that may have clouded the experience. The room was adequate, but I feel like I could have done better for $300 a night. Maybe I also couldn't help but think that when I used to live in this neighborhood The Lucerne was a women's residence for Barnard's College. In any event, it is certainly nicer than a dorm, and if the rooms are basic hotel-modern, the building itself has retained most of its early 20th century architectural character. (The deep red stone exterior is actually quite lovely.) Assessing the location would depend on your priorities. This slice of the Upper West Side is chock full of restaurants at all price levels, and many bars that attract a young and boisterous weekend drinking crowd. With that in mind, if you are sensitive to noise you might want to request a room that does not face either 79th Street or Amsterdam Avenue, particularly on the weekend and particularly in nice weather, when the drinkers can hang out on the street until 2 or 3 in the morning. The Lucerne does present a convenient location in terms of the subway (at the end of the street) and proximity to some great New York speciality shops (especially food). The Upper West Side is a vibrant and diverse neighborhood, and you also have the advantage, in warm weather, of proximity to both Riverside and Central Parks. In sum, The Lucerne is a decent choice, but if I wanted to stay in this neighborhood I would first look at The Excelsior, which is closer to Central Park, facing The Museum of Natural History. My experience with The Excelsior is also that it's better bang for the buck. But as I said, in all fairness, I did not have the opportunity to &quot;shop rates&quot; at The Lucerne."
165,1942,"Mar 1 2007	Excellent stay at the Lucerne	My wife and I spent one evening at the Lucerne in mid-February while we were in town for her birthday. We got a room with one king bed on the tenth floor. The room was terrific, on the north side of the building in a kind of quasi-corner, giving windows to the north and west. It had been very recently renovated, in a tan and gold scheme with french-style furniture with marble tops. The room was quiet, very comfortable, and, while hardly huge, had plenty of space. The staff was courteous, warm and professional. The location is perfect for access to the upper west side and the park. I will definitely stay there the next time I need a place in the neighborhood. Our stay was beyond expectations."
166,1942,"Feb 8 2007 	Wonderful service and hospitality	We arrived at the hotel at 11:45 PM just as we received a call from our son that our first grandson had been born. The people at the desk quickly signed us in, got our bags to the room, and hailed us a cab to the hospital. We stayed six nights in a queen suite and it was wonderful. The suite was spacious, attractive, and very clean. The staff were always helpful with any arrangements we needed to make. The doormen were fantastic. We will definitely make this hotel the place to stay when we make frequent visits."
167,1942,"Jan 24 2007	A decent balance between quality and price - recommended	We stayed at the Lucerne Hotel in December 2006, just before Chrstmas, for a couple of days, and found this to be a very pleasant place, for my wife and myself and also our two children (12 and 15 years oldI).The room was not very large, but the size was perfectly ok, since we went sightseeing throughout the days. Our children could stay with us, in the same room. Positive:The two beds were very comfatable and absolutely clearn, the bathroom was also very clean and ok.The location is absolutely perfect, if you want to discover New York.The breakfast at the Nice Matin restaurant which is located in the ground floor (but I understand that this is a separate company) was truly excellent (not included in the hotel price) - there is a large choice. We also had dinner once at the Nice Matin - really very good (Mediterranen food), but rather a bit expensive (the price seemed nevertheless justified). The only drawback in the evening (not in the morning) at the Nice Matin was the high level of noise.....The service of the hotel was efficient and friendly.Negative:In our view there is not really any negative aspect, Just an issue of taste: the room we had was not very &quot;modern&quot; in layout and style.,...Overall: Definitely worth a recomendation, definitely a decent balace between quality and price."
168,1942,"Jan 19 2007 	Fantastic hotel and good location	I would not hesitate to stay at this property again and as a travel agent will be recommending this property to all my clients. The staff were very good, friendly and efficient. The room was beautiful, I was fortunate to have one of the newly refurbished ones, if a little noisy - definitely request an inside room next time! There is a subway stop one block away which will take you straight to Times Square while Central Park and the Museum of Natural History are a short walk away. I would also thoroughly recommend the Shining Star restaurant which is a block away - delicious food with friendly but not overbearing service!"
169,1942,"Jan 16 2007 	Quite Comfortable	My husband and I just returned from 3 nights at the Lucerne and overall it was comfortable, clean and sufficed perfectly for our needs. It's not a sleek hotel with uber-modern interior decor and design but it is classy and has character. I would describe our room/suite as having a sort of shabby elegance to it. Definitely had an old, somewhat worn feeling to it, but this translated into a sort of coziness and hominess that we found welcoming in the dead of winter in NY. The bathroom and bedroom were perfectly clean, the shower was plenty strong, and the bed was amazingly comfy, though the pillows were on the lumpy side. Service was stellar. I had emailed earlier to ask for a room with more space (as we had a lot of luggage with us) and we found ourselves upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise. Noise was not really an issue for us though there were the typical NY &quot;night sounds&quot; at odd hours of the night that filtered through our 8th floor windows - sirens, etc. No biggie for us at all. Overall, NYC is just an amazing city and the Lucerne is a safe, decent, comfy and cozy place to stay, with excellent service to boot. Feels more like staying in a nice home (albeit slightly worn but in a comfy way) than a chic hotel."
170,1942,Jan 4 2007 	The reviewers were right	I read the reviews of this hotel before I booked it. We are a family of four and booked a double room between Christmas and New Years. We found that the many positive reviews were accurate. Our room was pleasant and clean. All staff were very pleasant. The location was quiet for N.Y. and close to public transportation. There were lots of dining options close by. The Nice Matin restaurant in the hotel was great. We would surely stay here again.
171,1942,"Jan 2 2007 	Fabulous and friendly!!	We had been waiting for this trip for 2 years - went for a 40th birthday celebration for my sister in law. The plan for to do some Christmas shopping, walk, drink coffee, wine and sink into the atmosphere!! It was the first time for all of us in NYC!! Arrived at hotel and booked in straight away. Initial thought on room is that it was small and it had no view to speak of, but after a chat with the lovely people on reception, they moved us to a bigger room overlooking Amsterdam. Rooms were very comfortable and warm and we did not experience much noise - we were on the 7th floor. Nice Martin was very nice, had breakfast and early evening glass of wine there although there are loads of places locally to eat. Hotel really close to Central Park and Natural History Museum. Subway 1 block away which was brilliant. We had a fantastic time and the hotel staff were brilliant and very helpful with advice as this was our first time (but definately not our last) to NYC. We would stay there again, it is just far enough away on the upper west side from the really busy central part of Manhatten, has loads of character and we want to go back! Enjoy!"
172,1942,"Jan 1 2007 	rooms not as comfy as suites	This is our third visit and all in all it was fabulous again. On previous occasions we had a junior suite, very quiet. These were not available now as they are being converted into executive king suites. The room that was given to us now was a luxury king on the highest room floor. In these non-suite rooms your bed is directly next to the entry door, and this door is not well isolated and has cracks. As a result, disturbing light comes in from the corridor, plus the noise. There's also street noise, due to the fact that the sliding windows don't close well. But after the first night I got used to it and had a decent sleep. Big thumbs up for the personnel that does everything to help you and make you feel at ease. This time we skipped the adjoining Nice Matin restaurant, but had our breakfasts at New Wave, nearby on Broadway. It's a small wonderful neighbourhood diner with very friendly waittresses. All the times we were there they played old Stevie Wonder songs and it all just fitted right. In the area there are many good local restaurants, it's always difficult to make a pick and you wish you could eat 7 times a day.Can't wait to be back."
173,1942,"Dec 19 2006 	Hotel Lucerne	This is really a great hotel - clean, efficient, comfortable. Great location too, 3 blocks from Central Park &amp; a really nice residential area with lots of restaurants &amp; bars around (EJ's luncheonette around the corner does great breakfasts, shakes, burgers etc!)This is ideal if you want to escape the mad, busy tourist areas of NYC &amp; recharge your batteries in the evening, but a Subway station is just at the end of the block to reach places really easily.Great stay &amp; will definately stay there again."
174,1942,"Dec 6 2006 	Give Lucerne a try.. Nice for the money	Great Location, Friendly Staff, room itself was larger then expected for NYC hotels. Only down-side needed new carpet yesterday. Besides that, enjoyed the stay at the lucerne. Room service and NiceMatin their restaurant were above average.Would stay their again and would recommend to all."
175,1942,"Nov 26 2006 	Good all round	Location was great, bus stop directly across the street and subway close by. Lots of restaurants close by (can recommend Sarabeth's). Was a good escape at the end of a hectic New York day, we slept sound every night - no noise from the street to keep us awake. Room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Would stay at the Lucerne again without hesitation."
176,1942,Nov 25 2006	Wonderful hotel still talking about our stay!	Recently stayed at the Lucerne Hotel on the upper west side. Every staff member was extremely friendly and helpful. This was our first stay in New York and when we left it felt as if we where leaving our dear friends.We were pleasantly surprised one afternoon for a guest appreciation event.Looking forward to our next visit.
177,1942,"Nov 16 2006 	Loved the Lucerne	I've been to NYC about 3 or 4 times on business in the last year and grew tired of staying in crowded Midtown, so I decided to stay in a different area this time. I learned about the Lucerne on ------.com and chose to stay at the hotel after reading all of the positive reviews on tripadvisor. I was very pleased with my experience - the hotel is in a quaint, old building that's very clean and the staff was very pleasant. I was in room 721, which is a great double-room with two double beds. The Upper West Side was such a nice change from the usual touristy areas. I had a great dinner at Coppola's, which is a cozy, charming Italian restaurant that's across the street from the hotel. If you're looking for luxury, the Lucerne is not the place for you, but if you're looking for a clean hotel with some character that's also reasonably priced, this is the place. I will definitely be returning."
178,1942,"Nov 16 2006 	Very comfortable and clean	We lived in this area for around 25 years, having left for California around 14 years ago, and still come back to visit regularly. My last remaining friend in the area, whose apartment we used to stay at, just sold his home to leave the city. So, we decided to stay at this hotel on our old home turf to do a business and pleasure tip to NYC.It's a very nice place, reasonably well kept with a few touches of class in terms of cleanliness, style, lobby, staff, a very nice litte gym, excellent service, robes, umbrella in the room, good beds, good pillows, free New York Times (or USA Today) every morning (even Sunday Times!), and a good wireless internet service for a flat fee per stay. I would recommend the hotel to others and probably stay there again. I should explain that this building is on the northwest corner of 79th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and is in one of the best non-touristy residential areas of Manhattan -- referred to as the &quot;upper west side&quot;. Two sides of the building face the street, and the other two sides abut adjacent buildings. We stayed in a suite on the ninth floor (there are twelve plus penthouse) with two queen beds that faced 79th Street. It was noiser than the inner sides of the building (north and west facing), but since it faced south, it got a good deal of sun. Since I'm from New York, the traffic noise -- cut down signifcantly by the good windows (which you can open, by the way) -- didn't bother us at all. Because they originally offered us a room on the fifth floor facing west, I can tell you that I noticed that if you are facing west, you must be on the 6th floor or above or you will be facing a dark light well. That side will, however be quieter.The stay was not without minor problems. So, just to list them: 1) Drinking glasses were not always replaced with clean ones, 2) The suite had insufficient workspace so that even though it had a little kitchenette, there was really no good place for two people to sit and eat. There was only one desk chair in the sitting room (and also a loveseat and a TV), so we could not both sit at the little desk. We tried to bring a small easychair in from the bedroom, but it wouldn't fit through the doorway. I suppose we could have asked for anther desk chair, but we didn't. 3) Both TV remotes (there were two TVs in this suite) needed new batteries that could not be replaced by a guest (unless the guest happened to be packing a set of Alan wrenches). We called to have the batteries replaced ($5 tip) but thought it was a little suspicious in the first place, since both remotes were bad. We particularly thought it suspicious when the guy they sent with two new remotes received another call while he was servicing our room, about another room that need new remotes. The service was very fast, however. 4) There was a fridge in the room that wasn't working; but they quickly replaced it from their stash of (as I was told by one staff member) around 20 spare fridges. Another $5 tip to reward very fast service. But hmmm. 5) We took the flat rate option for wireless internet service ($11.95, I believe) that covered our whole stay, but it incorrectly expired twice. The hotel did make good on their promise to keep it a flat rate; but we had to go through the hassle of setting the account up again both times it expired. And of course, things like that always stop working when you can least afford the time!So, despite our little list of problems (and we are nitpickers who can find problems in pretty much &gt;any&lt; hotel), we thought they were were all reasonably small and manageable. Thus the basic recommendation holds."
179,1942,"Nov 13 2006 	Nice place - had a great time	Found the Lucerne on TripAdvisor and liked the look of it, so my brother and I booked in for four nights in September 2005.Using it as a home base we ventured out by foot to all points of interest between Central Park and Battery Park, including Ground Zero, Empire State Building, Wall Street etc etc, and let me tell you - next time we rent a car. It was a long, long walk even for two fit young guys, so plan ahead if you're older or infirm.The area is great at night, with a huge selection of places to eat and drink, from sports bars to themed restaurants etc. There is also a convenience store across the street for all your needs. The staff are friendly, the place is clean as a whistle, and the room was a perfect size ( two double beds, bathroom, tv, coffee maker)The only problem we had was a lack of a fridge, but there was cold beer to be had up and down Amsterdam, so it wasn't a drama. Great place and we plan on returning March 07."
180,1942,"Nov 7 2006 	An elegant hotel in a thriving neighbourhoor	We stayed here over NYC marathon weekend but you couldn't tell from the staff that they were probably stretched to capacity.A faultless check-in on the Thursday coincided with complementary afternoon tea (OK so it was Earl Grey in plastic beakers but they were really trying!) All the front of house staff were civility itself. The hotel is a little off the tourist track for things like the big 5 Ave shops but absolutely great for Central Park, the Lincoln Centre and the Natural History Museum. The room (a double Queen on the 11th floor) was big enough for the three adults staying and was serviced every day by housekeeping.The fact it's off the beaten track is one of its more redeeming features as you don't feel that the restaurants around the place are only after the tourist $. And downtown is only a cab or a convenient subway ride away. Local restaurant recommendations would be Sarabeth across the street, EJ diner just two blocks up or a fantastic bakery just a little further up Amsterdam serving all organic produce.The hotel also laid on pre-marathon snacks as we left early on the Sunday morning which showed their attention to their guests. One word of warning though if you're on a budget allow for the myriad of NY taxes on top of the room rate, occupancy, tourist and sales tax added a further $200 to our final 4 night bill."
181,1942,"Oct 24 2006 	A great family neighbouhood	We have just returned from a four night stay at the The Lucerne hotel. We stayed in a double superior room with our two children aged seven and ten. The hotel was excellent, the staff were very helpful and friendly ,the room size was adequate for us especially as all we did was sleep there. The best part of the Lucerne was it's location we loved the UWS especially Amsterdam Ave - so many shops and restaurants .Our children felt really at home and it was nice to see the local children coming and going to school. Fantastic breakfasts at Good Enough To Eat and EJ's.For a quick cheap and typical New York breakfast try Zabars. The subway was only two minutes walk away or you can walk to to central park, natural history museum or Columbus circle if you want take in more of the city . The planatarium in the Rose space center was the highlight of our trip.The only negative of the trip was the Jekyll and Hyde club on Sixth Ave,the food was expensive and poor quality and the entertainment was rubbish.We would definitely stay at the Lucerne again."
182,1942,"Oct 18 2006	great stay wished it was less expensive	From Chicago.Stayed Columbus Day weekend. We did a lot of research on this website and others. Narrowed down to Lucerne or Affinia Manhattan. Affinia Manhattan was $50 less a night. But went with Lucerne because we felt the neighborhood feel and proximity to Central Park made it $50 better.I think we were right.We payed avg of $350/night for 4 nights. This seemed very expensive but was par for the course as we checked other hotels.Overall great stay. We (wife and I) stayed in the standard (small) Queen room. Everything was very clean and in very good condition. Staff was very helpful and very polite.Our first room had only a view of the brick wall of the building next to us. I called front desk and asked for a better room. Reception needed a few minutes to check for available room. Called back a few minutes later with a better room. Bellhop came to our room with new keys and took our bags to the other room. Great service. This room was on the 6th floor overlooking Amsterdam Av.Bathroom was very clean and maid service did a fine job.Went to Nice Matin (attached restaurant) for breakfast one morning with the 20% off hotel coupon. Excellent breakfast. Looked like a lot of locals were there.The neighborhood is the upper west side and has got a very busy, tight feel to it. A lot of small business and restuarants lining Amsterdam and Broadway. Though based on other reviews of the area I expected the area to be more upscale. I didn't get that impression at all. Kind of dirty (much the same as all of NYC). The area is pretty lively late night. Restaurants and bars are active. But only a 10 min walk to the Park. 3 min walk to Subway.Would stay here again unless I found I real good deal elsewhere.Would have given it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive."
183,1942,"Oct 13 2006 	Great Stay	This is a top notch hotel. The location can not be beat. Upper West side, 79th and Amsterdam.Busy all the time, in the area, but the hotel was calm and spotless. More areas to eat than I can list. We had dinner at the ocean grill , 78th and Columbus, one block over, Tremendous dinner and well presented. I had Tuna grilled that was out of the world. We also ate at Coppolos, across the street from the hotel. Great Italian. The subway stop is one block over at 79th and Broadway. Very safe and easy to figure out with a map. No need to stay near Times square.Breakfast is easy, there is a coffee shop on every corner.And i usually got coffee and rolls/muffins , at world coffee , Columbus and 80th. I did not have any bad coffee during my stay. Everything you need is within walking dsistance. You will not believe the choices available. We have stayed near Times Square in the past, but this is my new favorite place to stay. My one complaint is that the room is a bit small, but we were only able to book a double, the hotel was full."
184,1942,"Sep 19 2006 	Great Stay	We stayed three nights at The Lucerne Hotel from Aug. 15 - 18th (room 1223). The room was much bigger than we anticipated and was very clean. My husband, two teenage boys and myself had enough room and did not feel cramped at all. The beds were real comfortable, maybe too comfortable as we slept in later than we planned to each day.Across the street was a good deli for breakfast and also an Italian restaurant that was good and reasonably priced. It wasa couple of blocks to the subway which we found convenient.The staff was very friendly and accomodating. We are hoping to go back next year and we would definitely stay here again. We chose this hotel from previous reviews on Trip Advisor."
185,1942,"Aug 8 2006	Wonderful	We stay at the Lucerne whenever we are in New York. The accomodations are excellent and the location is perfect, but I wanted to make a special note after our most recent trip in July. I traveled with my husband, two young boys and my mom who is 84. She is still active, but does have mobility issues. I cannot began to say how thoughtful and accomodating the doormen and staff were to my mom. Everytime we came and went (which was often during the day), they went out of their way to make sure she was comfortable, helped her in and out of taxis, and always made her feel like like a special guest! In addition, the conceirge at the hotel was able to get us fabulous tickets to a show on very short notice. We had such a wonderful time and always enjoyed coming &quot;home&quot; to our hotel. L. Wadsworth, Tampa, FL"
186,1942,"Jul 24 2006 	Great neighborhood very nice hotel	I have been going to NYC for years, but had particular needs on this trip that were met by the Lucerne for a good price. It's a very distinctive old building in a great location about 5- 10 mins stroll from various subway lines and 10 mins walk to the park. The double room we had (1010) was a corner room with nice views of 79th and Amsterdam. Decent bathroom and above average beds (I am picky about that). Pleasant staff, pretty lobby and chic restaurant downstairs. I chose it mainly for the neighborhood and two of my favorite NYC restuarants: Sarabeth's and Isabella's. There are so many great restaurants to try in the area and Zabar's is just down the street. It's a must, as is H&amp;H for the best bagels in Manhattan. Both places are near 80th st on Broadway.One special note: They have ragingly good air conditioning in summer! We were kept very cool on the hottest week of the year thus far.I'd happily stay there again and recommend it to my picky parents,"
187,1942,"Jul 23 2006 	Good choice for our first visit to NYC	We chose the Lucerne based on Trip Advisor reviews for our family's first-ever visit to NYC and it was a good choice. Our stay was for 3 nights in July, 2006. The hotel was clean and we found both the desk staff and bellhops to be very friendly and helpful. The neighbourhood appears safe and clean. There are subway stations within a few blocks that took us to Yankee Stadium, the Broadway Theatre District, Statue of Liberty, etc. The Nice/Matin restaurant downstairs was good and there is a sufficient choice of other restaurants nearby, plus a handy 24-hour drug store across the street. The only negative comments we would make are that the rooms are small (normal for NYC I'm sure), there was a fair amount of street noise coming through the closed window (again, has to be normal for most any NYC hotel) and when it was time to leave for the train station the bellhop had about a 15 minute struggle trying to flag down a cab - for some reason it doesn't appear cabs want to take fares from the Lucerne, so plan to leave a little early if you want to take a cab. We would definitely stay at the Lucerne if we visited NYC again, especially since it is situated in a quieter, more residential neighbourhood than farther south in Manhattan."
188,1942,"Jul 9 2006	Good place to stay	Having read the reviews of the Lucerne on TripAdvisor, we decided to book here. Overall the hotel is good and there were minor problems (which seemed to occur on a daily basis) during our stay but these were immediately rectified by the friendly staff. Such problems included a leak in our initial room that we were given, a tempramental TV and a lack of hot water one morning (which seemed to be a central boiler problem). As I say these problems were immediately tended to on reporting and the staff were very courteous which made a lot of difference.Our room was clean, of a good size and quiet. Room service was good even in the early hours of the morning and the tourism desk in the lobby was very helpful (although chairs at its desk wouldn't go amiss!).The location of the hotel is good for getting away from the crowds at Times Square and if you feel brave the '1' subway station is virtually opposite the hotel. We chose to take taxis around which can work out expensive with tips etc. Good local restaurants are abundant around the hotel although we didn't have a chance to visit Nice Matin.Overall we would probably stay there again if the rates were as comparitively good as we managed this time."
