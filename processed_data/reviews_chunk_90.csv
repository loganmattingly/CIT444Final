220,1961,"Jan 11 2009 	Worst Customer service EVER!	I have been working in Hotels for the past 4 years, and if I had ever dared to behave such as the Roosevelt Hotel employee, I would have got fired! This should probably say enough of my stay! I addition, I believe the management is poor: in 4 diamond Hotels it cannot take you one hour to check your baggage in. It is ridiculous! The fun part was sharing incredible nasty customer service stories with the other people of the Hotel.DONT GO THERE!"
221,1961,"Jan 11 2009 	Get Ready to tip everyone.....who works there	When you arrive get ready for tipping first the porter just for opening the the door for you he looks forward for a tip, then we went to check-inn which was fast but room wasn't ready but we where early, we didn't mind so we gave the luggage to the guy who controls the luggae room- , he asked for money, then again when we picked the luggage, and when we where leaving same routine, even to book a cab from concierge you have to pay a tip, Greedy staff............ The room wasn't that bad (half clean mind you) comftable bed, but when you enter the bathroom you will have a shock, it's a room with an old sink and a curtuian in the middle of the room. The good thing a bout this hotel it''s in a central area of manhattan, it's in a quite area and it's very safe and the lobby is very nice which looks like a 5 star hotel. For the price we paid i think it was overpriced for the standard of the hotel we paid around 350.00 dollars nightly...."
222,1961,"Jan 9 2009 	Nothing special	Hello,We were in New York during the holidays and we stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel. It was definetly not the freshest hotel we stayed at. Everything seemed old, dusty and in desperate need of renevation. The amount of dust whiche we had in our room was shocking. It was almost difficult to breath when we were in out beds. Not mentioning the bathroom whiche can problem remember Franklin Roosevelt. The staff was not very helpful and they were always in a bad mood. The room service was expensive and bad. The food was cold and strange looking."
223,1961,"Jan 9 2009	Great President/Bad Hotel	Priceline sold this as a 31/2* hotel. It was not. The heat could not be controled in the room. It was either on (too hot) or off(too cold). So I attempted to open the window at which point I pulled a muscle and walked around NY for 4 days in pain. The window did open. This did control the heat. Oh and the heater was noisey.In order to get the toilet to flush you had to hold the handle down for 10 seconds.The room doors are heavy and the doors slam if yiou are not careful and most guests are not. So if you are a light sleeper,stay away..They charge $15 a day for internet. Other hotels are free.The rooms are decorated in very old styles and there is nothing attractive about them. I had one small trash can and had to ask for another.I had to ask to have the smelly shower curtain changed and there was a left over mouth wash bottle given to me. The sink, hidden by the shower curtain, juts out into the tub and while trying to adjust the drain I cracked my head on the sink. I thought this was my demise. I just have a large bump.I'm happy I got out alive.Oh and when I wanted a cab one day I asked the door man if this is where I should stand for a taxi. He said yes, but just stood there too. I saked if he assisted guests? He said&quot;Well lady you didn't ask that.&quot; What a control freak. I got my own taxi and he lost a tip.The loby was nice and the front desk staff was curteous.The concierge sent us to a closed restaurant."
224,1961,"Jan 7 2009 	Great Location	Our dealings through the hotels website and over the phone was really good, the staff we dealt with on the phone were polite and helpful, so I was sort of expecting the same when we arrived. We didn't arrive at the hotel until 11pm, it was lashing down with rain and there was no bellman, a guy who was staying at the hotel helped us in with our luggage, and were we glad he did as there was a flight of stairs to climb to the lobby. There were bellmen at their desk and they watched this guy carry our bags up the stairs, offered no help and were very dismissive when he informed them that there was no bellman outside to help us. The reception staff were also dismissive, after I gave my name to check in a registration form was plonked in front of me to sign, we were handed our room key and told &quot;you're on the 16th floor&quot;.......in a very bored voice.The room was very shabby and we actually thought they had given us the wrong room. We booked a superior room with 2 double beds, and it certainly didn't match up to the photos or description on their site. We asked at the front desk (a different person than before) to check we were in the right room and was told in the same indifferent, bored voice that &quot;yes, it's a superior&quot; we stated we weren't very happy, there was wallpaper peeling off, the enamel was peeling off the bath, and were told &quot;there's no other rooms available&quot; and then turned away from us. So great service is NOT one of their strong points, especially the reception staff. The bellmen got better while we were there and we ended up quite liking them, they were very helpful.The room was very small and very shabby, as I described earlier, in fact it was so small that you couldn't pull the chair out from under the desk as it hit the foot of the bed. The lobby is fantastic, and when you've seen that and the photos of the hotel rooms on the website it was a real letdown to walk into our room. Although we were there in the middle of December, the room was boiling. Even with the window open and the air con on full blast it was still roasting. Food is very expensive and I wouldn't recommend room service, costs a fortune and it wasn't very good either, but there are so many places nearby to eat that doesn't really matter. Another huge annoyance was no coffee/tea making facilities in the room or mini bar for a cold drink.BUT the huge plus that would make me stay there again (now I know what to expect) is the location. It was perfect - right around the corner from 5th ave, a few blocks from Empire State, right around the corner from Grand Central, a few blocks from Times Square.......we walked EVERYWHERE........the location is what really sells this hotel, so if all you want is a bed for the night with no frills and want to be right in the heart of everything then I would definately use this hotel."
225,1961,"Jan 4 2009 	Run-Down	I have stayed in New York often and know it is difficult to find good hotels there for less than $200. We paid about 140 for this via Priceline. For that price, I've stayed at nicer places in the city - difficult to do but possible and worth looking.I would urge everyone to stay clear of this hotel. The rooms are suitable if you have low standards and don't mind ratty furniture and carpets. Any couple looking for a nice or romantic place should be especially weary since there is nothing even remotely romantic about the rooms - we felt like we were staying in the shining. When looking at the pics of the website, be aware the rooms look much better than they actually are - take those room pics and subtract 20 years of wear and tear. Not worth the even bargain price we paid.Btw, rude staff and poor service dont matter to me, but clean rooms do. As for the staff, they were nice enough although the lobby was very crowded. The whole hotel felt run down and musty.Also, this is my first review ever but the experience was bad enough to urge me to write this review. Would hate to see other people waste their money on this place.."
226,1961,"Jan 4 2009 	Great Location and Price Needs a Facelift	The location of this hotel is awesome and the package I got with our airfare made it very affordable. However, I will caution that it badly needs a facelift, sort of what you would have expected in the mid-eighties. We had booked a non-smoking room and it wasn't available. When we got off the elevator, the entire hallway had a haze to it. Surprisingly, our room wasn't too bad for smell and we had been given a corner room which was about three times as large as a normal NYC room. My other caution is with regard to the bell desk. I had made arrangements to get a set fare car to the airport and was told it wouldn't be a problem, to return in an hour and it would be waiting. When we returned, I was told by a different staff member that there were no set fare cars available but that he had a cab ready to take me. I protested and suddenly the town car sitting right in front of the building was mine, as previously arranged. I had earlier seen money surreptitiously changing hands between the cabbies and the bellmen. Now I understand why. We didn't spend much time in our room, so this met our needs. If you plan on seeing a lot and are not concerned about hotel amenities, this is a good location and price for a home base."
227,1961,"Jan 3 2009 	Good All Rounder	Had read mixed reviews about this hotel but I personally found it fine. It is what it claims to be. A well located hotel with old world charm. Old world charm doesn't come with shiny new appliances as a result the furniture may be a bit battered but everything was clean, rooms were well equipped and service was professional. The hotel has character and a personality. The lobby and liunge area have the wow factor on arrival and it's nice to sit around and soak up the atmosphere. Put on a dress, sip a cocktail () sorted!"
228,1961,"Dec 31 2008 	Great location!	This hotel is located right by Grand Central Station so it makes it very convenient and so accessible. It's also walking distance to a bunch of other places such as Rockefeller Center, United Nations, Times Square, some of the best shopping places, and even Central Park if you have your walking shoes on! The rooms are a bit small, but for the value, its not so bad, considering its in Midtown. The staff was very nice and accommodating. We got there really early in the morning and after storing our luggage and went out and about, they were nice enough to call us when a room was ready for early check-in. They also let us borrow a couple hotel umbrellas as it was raining during our stay and arranged for a town car to pick us up and take us to the airport after checking out. It was a great, I will definitely stay here again."
229,1961,"Dec 27 2008	No No No ...	I am travelling a lot and seen a lot of countries and hotels, but this one was the worst hotel I have ever been in.There is NOTHING good in this hotel, it's just in the good location. Hotel badly needs renovation, it's so and too old, probably never been renovated since ...Sorry, but if you have used to quality, cleaness and better service find another place to stay."
230,1961,"Dec 26 2008	Jaded. Give it a pass.	Prior to arriving we were excited about staying in a real New York hotel, like we had seen in the movies. On arriving, several bellhops stood around watching while my wife and I hauled our heavy suitcases up the large set of stairs into the lobby. Only once we finally got to the top did any one of them come forward offering to help. Throughout our stay the staff always seemed to expect a tip, which I expected, but not for doing almost nothing for us. The front desk staff seemed jaded and indifferent. The rooms were small, as we had expected, but also not in good shape. The bathroom shower system was terrible, leaving pools of water all over the floor. There was no coffee maker or any extras in the room whatsoever. And it seemed like it could use a good thorough cleaning, or at least a good renovation. The concierge was helpful in helping us to plan our activities, although again he seems jaded and really didn't offer anything more than the bare limits of his job description. The brunch was tasty, but expensive so it had better be. Overall, this hotel was not a good experience for our first time to New York. I would definitely not go back. We popped in to some other hotels while wandering around New York, and most times we were warmly greeted, unlike the Rosevelt."
231,1961,"Dec 18 2008 	Fantastic Hotel Ignore the Other Reviews!	Hotel was booked through Travel Zoo where it was a featured offer - superior room with breakfast. My husband and I went to New York for my 'much dreaded' birthday and we mentioned this at check-in. We were delighted to find out we had been upgraded to a suite which I later found out cost $1700 per night! The suite was spotlessly clean and enormous - we had a lounge with a sofa and two armchairs, coffee tables and two 42&quot; wide screen televisions! There was a kitchen area and a dining room area for 4 people to eat! The breakfast was great and well worth having because you didn't need to eat for the rest of the day. Huge choices of cooked food plus omelettes (the omelette cook was pretty miserable but her omelettes were great) and waffles to order. Loads of fresh fruit and freshly cooked bread and pastries. The location is great, 5 mins from Grand Central Station and you could walk to 5th Avenue, the Rockerfeller Centre and most other places. We bought a one day bus pass (the downtown route is the best) and if your time is limited this is the best thing you can do. You simply get on and off as you want. The price for the ticket from the hotel concierge is the same price as at the bus stop and of course you can pay by credit card which you might prefer. I am sorry that other people didn't have such a great time as us, but I really can't fault this hotel in anyway. Special thanks to Paulette for the upgrade."
232,1961,"Dec 17 2008	Best value for your money in NYC!	My mom and I recently took a quick 2-day trip to NYC to enjoy the Christmas decorations. We stayed at the Roosevelt b/c we stayed there back in 1995 and it was ok. It has since been renovated and it is really nice. It's very clean, safe, comfortable, and convenient. The price was great too - less than $150/night which seems to be a deal based on my research for this time of year in Manhattan. The only negative thing I noticed was the room was a bit noisy. But who goes to NYC to sit in a hotel room?? I would definitely stay at the Roosevelt again. Highly recommended."
233,1961,"Dec 17 2008 	Not recommended	My company booked us a business stay at The Roosevelt earlier this month. I would not recommend it. Both the bedroom and bathrooms had not been cleaned, there was a large cigarette burn in the sheets and other stains, the tv didn't work and there was a load of mould growing around the shower and bathtub. The staff were incredibly rude, barely even speaking to us let alone being polite. They seem more interested in chatting to each other than helping at the check in desk. However the concierge that came to fix a problem with the heating in my room was very helpful. Bellboys try to procure money out of you by using threatening and abusive language, and actually count their tips in front of you as you wait in the lift! All in all it was a horrible stay and I will never go back their again."
234,1961,"Dec 12 2008 	Not fabulous not terrible.	Just stayed here 2 nights on a business trip and have to agree with previous 2 posts. The lobby is very impressive (especially when all decked out in its holiday finery) and the location is really great, both for proximity to tourist sites (Rockefeller Center, Times Square) &amp; the city's commercial center (for my business appointments, at least). The rooms are perfectly serviceable, but not extraordinary. Overall I feel like the place could've done with a good dusting and carpet cleaning. As for room size, I booked a &quot;cozy queen&quot; room (and we all know that &quot;cozy&quot; is just a euphemism for minuscule), so I was expecting the room to be the size of a broom closet, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a decent size.I also stayed here years ago, since which time the hotel has been renovated, and it's definitely much better than it used to be. I would most likely stay here again."
235,1961,"Dec 11 2008 	just ok	..great location for shopping,, not a child friendly hotel but great for couples and business people...lobby is stunning, rooms very basic, holes in bed linen, dust behind and under bed inch thick, curtains look as though they have never been washed, no tea and coffee facilities...staff keep themselves to themselves but polite when approached...if you love shopping and got lots of money to spend then this is an amazing place, however due to the recent economic problems bargins were very few and far between."
236,1961,"Dec 9 2008 	Fantastic Location - Not so sure about the staff	My boyfriend and I were staying in New York for sight seeing and Christmas shopping. The Roosevelt had a great location and we were really pleased when we checked in. However we found the staff very pushy and rude where tips were concerned - on our arrival at the hotel we had no change as we'd just travelled from the airport, and the concierge waited until my bf had to scrabble around finding his smallest note. Then as we were leaving we were verbally abused at the front of the hotel by the concierge for only having a one dollar bill. I know americans expect tips, and we have no problem giving a tip when we have had good service - but this guy had just hailed us a cab! That was his job! We were really disappointed by the attitude of the staff.Our room was nice, the bed was very 'squishy' (almost too soft for me) and the air con rattled like nothing i'd ever heard! But otherwise the room was good. It wasn't the greatest room i'd ever stayed in, but i've never stayed elsewhere in NY so perhaps this was excellent for this price range!Overall, the hotel was good and i would probably stay there again!"
237,1961,"Dec 8 2008 	Fantastic Location	I stayed at the Roosevelt for 4 nights and had a great time. The location was literally across the street from Grand Central which provided great transportation access and also lots of food options. The hotel is (if you are in reasonably good shape) walking distance to Empire State Bldg, Rockefellor Center and Times Sqare. Rooms are sizable for NYC and bathroom is not spacious but far better than many other NYC hotels I've stayed at. I will recommed this hotel to anyone going to NYC to sight see."
238,1961,"Dec 8 2008	Loved the location	We got a good rate (saw it on travelzoo) for a busy time of year. The location was great for us, near transportation and nidtown attractions. The rooms (cozy queen) were really tiny, but clean and well laid out. The staff were all pleasant and quite helpful with directions and livery car. We had a drink on premises, but didn't try the restaurant there (so many great alternatives near-by). As long as you don't require lots of space, i would certainly reccomend this hotel."
239,1961,"Dec 4 2008 	Hideous awful gross and rude staff!!!	My boyfriend and I booked a 'romantic' 4 night stay at The Roosevelt Hotel earlier this month and really wish we hadn't. We booked a 'suite' over the phone, only to be told that they had double booked when we arrived. No apologies given, and instead we had to make do with with the superior room they gave us - which had a view overlooking the garbage!!!!! Not only were the desk staff unbelievably rude and unhelpful, the rooms were hideous and scummy with peeling paint. But even despite the crummy room, we could have put up with it all, were it not for the horrible staff members we encountered. They seem to have a problem with young couples and were utterly dismissive and rude to us. When I asked for an email address for the director/head of the hotel I was greeted with a patronising laugh. It was only when the receptionist saw that I was writing down the names of all the members of staff to make a compliant that she suddenly became polite - the only nice words we had in our 4 night stay! Don't bother with this hotel. The less customers they get, the more they will have to make over their shabby hotel - and send their staff to a customer service course!!"
240,1961,"Dec 1 2008 	Giving thanks for the Roosevelt	I spent Thanksgiving, as I do each year, in New York City.I try a different hotel each time and this trip it was the Roosevelt.The Roosevelt is a &quot;grand old hotel&quot; in a fabulous location on 45th &amp; Madison.I booked a deluxe room and I am glad that I did, as peeking into &quot;superior&quot; rooms, I saw that they are quite small.I called Alan in guest services well in advance of my trip to ask for a spacious, bright, quiet room with a bathtub. He said he'd take care of it and he did!My room was just what I needed, on a corner with plenty of light, and on the top floor (18).The bed was quite comfy and the room well appointed. Flat screen TV and safe, but no in-room coffee maker or robes.The age of the crown moulding was showing and the bathroom small, but over all, this was a very pleasant room.I did meet Alan when he came to make sure that I was taken care of and I showed my appreciation for his attention monitarily. He continued to be at my disposal throughout my stay, even sending up a refrigerator at no charge.The water pressure was weak, to say the least, and it took quite some time to fill the bathtub, although the shower was fine. There is no view to speak of at the hotel.The lobby bar was a nice place to have a drink and watch people move through the holiday-decorated lobby. The food was quite good, especially the enormous crab cake. Prepare for New York prices though.The staff, especially the maids, were extremely pleasant and helpful.All-in-all, I would recommend the Roosevelt. You can't beat the location (2 blks from Grand Central) and the value for what you get.Way to go Alan!Thanks for a great Thanksgiving!"
241,1961,"Nov 30 2008	Great Hotel even better location	The Roosevelt Hotel, wow really good hotel, well mannerd staff and helpful, looks great espeically in the reception and bar. The room wasnt quite as amazing as we had thought when booking as room only contained king size bed, chest of drawers, desk and desk chair with bedside cabinats and of course en suite, and it was quite small but too be honest your in New York and the hotel location on 5th avenue makes it an awesome hotel great for sightseeing and getting around everythings so close - can walk too Times Square, Rockafeller, Emprie State, Central Park.We stayed 7 nights and it was great I wouldnt recommed breakfast esp not if your on holiday as its so much easier too have bagels etc the choice is endless we had breakfast once it was average.Overall 10/10"
242,1961,"Nov 24 2008	Great hotel for the price	Just got back from a long weekend stay at the Roosevelt. Met some girlfriends there so we had two rooms. One was a nicer corner room with a king. The other a smaller room with two queens. It was definitely on the smaller side (normal for NY, I understand) but it was not a problem for both of us to get ready at once. PROS: great location! Walking distance to Times Square, Theatre district, Grand Central Station. Hardly ever a wait for a taxi. Charming lobby. Comfortable rooms CONS: The room, especially the bathroom, was always sooo warm. It was freezing outside and the room was too warm! I also had a problem with the shower going between hot and cold. (I never had time to complain because we were so busy). Summary: I would say that it was a good bang for the buck. We got a really good deal through Travelzoo.com."
243,1961,"Nov 23 2008	Wonderful	Check-in was fast and friendly....got an upgrade when I mentioned this was my &quot;retirement trip&quot;. Helpful, prompt staff. Room was great, with extras, also. Iron and ironing board, fantastic bed. I WILL stay there again. An exceptional location."
244,1961,"Nov 23 2008 	FANTASTIC - WILL BE BACK	This hotel is fantastic - the staff so helpful and courteous. We arrived and were were very warmly welcomed by a lovely receptionist, who informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite which was fab. Had a problem with the safe (our fault) and rang reception and within a couple of minutes an engineer came to look at it and explained to us how to use it properly. Please ignore any negative reviews you may have read regarding this hotel. It really is really is great."
245,1961,"Nov 22 2008	Enjoyable stay at the ROOSEVELT	Just returned from New york, stayed for 5 days at the Roosevelt Hotel on 45th street, after reading very contrasting reports i was a bit unsure about staying there but please be reassured, my daughter and i arrived on the Saturday evening, checked straight in and shown to rooms within minutes( room 1214) it was a twin room with two queen size beds, lovely and clean with everything you should require while staying in the big apple, the hotel is a good example of a traditional hotel, it is not ultra chic, or modern but it does the job, everythin worked and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the lobby is beautiful with a super xmas tree in the centre, bar prices expensive but everwhere was expensive,Location was excellent only a short walk from to TImes Square, Grand Central Station and the Empire state building, and for cheap breakfast you cant beat THE BROOKLYN BAGEL BAR opposite the empire state building bit scruffy looking but gorgeous coffee only 1 dollar and bagels to die for, a very enjoyable stay"
246,1961,"Nov 22 2008 	Majestic dream came true	The first time I visited New York. Me and my wife are enchanted. Roosevelt is really above average and the location is the best. Nearby 5th and Times Square. You can walk to Empire State, Rockefeller Center, Broadway. Good Service and nice people."
247,1961,"Nov 21 2008 	Above Average	The Bar is extremely over priced ($10 for a small/bad glass of wine) and smells of wet dog, but the rest of the lobby was grand enough. The Christmas tree had just gone up and it looked amazing. The room we stayed in was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The facilities were clean and modern. The location is what sells this hotel, walking distance to most of the top attractions and right next to Grand Central Station for the rest of them."
248,1961,"Nov 16 2008 	Lovely old hotel friendly staff	My husband, two young daughters, and I stayed at the Roosevelt this past weekend. Everyone was very friendly and granted requests cheerfully, and our room was large and clean. We really enjoyed staying at the Roosevelt, and again, the staff were really so pleasant that they made our whole stay even more enjoyable than it already was."
249,1961,"Nov 16 2008 	Worst Hotel In New York A	I DONT OFTEN GIVE OUT BUT I Stayed at this hotel from Monday 10th - Saturday 15th October this is my 3rd time in new york 1st at the roosevelt and last. When we went to check in we were told to come back in 1 1/2 hrs to be told to come back in another 1hr ,On the 3rs afternoon the lock broke on our room door 1045 had to move room 1049 . The safe in the new room did not work and our toilet kept blocking. we got no help from main desk not there probem need to see the manager on duty who was always on the phone at the end we just stayed away from the hotel as much as possibe.There is a good irish bar between 2nd &amp; 3rd on 47th . So to top it all off when we checked out we had to wait on our luggage to come down from the room 55 mins. they could not find a trolley. Rooms over all are very dated hole in bed sheet and not very clean."
250,1961,"Nov 15 2008 	Great Location.	We recently stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel. The hotel is right across the street from Grand Central Terminal. We walked there for breakfast and dinner. There is a Rite Aid located there where we purchased snacks and bottled water. The hotel is a short walk from Times Square, Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building. We were able to walk to most of the attractions and only had to use the subway one day of our stay.Our room was clean and the beds were comfortable. There were a few stains on the carpet in the hallway and a few small tears in the carpet in our room, but it didn't affect the quality of our stay. The shower head was loose, but the water ran just fine and we had plenty of hot water. We are a family of four and our room rate included breakfast for two. We were given breakfast vouchers when we checked in. My husband and I ate breakfast in the hotel and then took our two boys to a local Dunkin Donuts. One morning we decided to skip breakfast at the hotel and save the vouchers. We we planning to use four breakfast vouchers our last day at the hotel. We were later advised that we could use no more than two vouchers/day. We ended up going to Grand Central for breakfast and threw away the last four vouchers. I think the hotel could have allowed our family of four to use the remaining vouchers on the same day. We were entitled to free breakfast, but lost out because of the hotel policy of only two vouchers/day. Overall we had a very good stay and I would definitely stay there again. The location cannot be beat."
251,1961,"Nov 13 2008	Consistently good and friendly	I have found the reviews here to be helpful, so I am just returning the favor.I recently moved to upstate New York and travel to NYC fairly frequently for short stays.I have stayed at the Roosevelt several times. I have stayed with my 2 daughters as older teens /twenties , with my husband, as well as solo. Despite a few problems (which were quickly and cheerfully corrected) I gotta say I really like this hotel. It has a nice &quot;feel&quot;.The lobby is wonderful in the &quot;grand old&quot; sense, the location is perfect if you are using Grand Central station for comings and goings, it is safe and friendly even for a woman traveling solo, the bar is welcoming and the bartenders know their stuff. The food is quite good at the hotel, but also good and much cheaper in the little diners, etc. throughout the city. Be aware that prices for drinks are high, as they are everywhere in New York (not just the City). Paying $10 - $12 for a cocktail or glass of wine is no biggie. I generally pay $150 - $225 US to stay here, and if I can't get a room at that price, I look elsewhere. At $150 / night a room here is a steal, even if it is of the not-as-lovely variety . At $225 / night it is still a good deal. I doubt I would pay over $275 NOT because the rooms and hotel aren't worth it, but because I know the city and where to find a better deal.Be aware that, as is the case with many hotels that have some &quot;history&quot;, rooms may vary significantly in size, configuration, view, and decor, and the price does not always reflect this difference. I have stayed in a lovely, bright, large corner room with a huge bathroom and have also been assigned a less lovely, somewhat dark room...and paid essentially the same price. have had occasional problems with the rooms- once I was assigned a room with a poorly functioning air conditioner and another time the room was unacceptable due to conditions others have cited, however, I am impressed by the response of the staff in quickly, and without argument, assigning me a different room.In my experience, check-in , check out is always smooth, altho I rarely check in or out at peak times. The hotel will gladly store your bags if you get in early or have to wait after check out for a train, plane, or whatever."
252,1961,"Nov 13 2008 	Small mold blocked Fox News	Very small rooms. Closet was not even wide enough to hang my suits! Mold on walls around soap dish in extremely small shower. Not room to walk around bed with carry on bag on the floor. TV index shows FoxNews but upon entering that channel could not get. Called front desk and they said that channel was blocked and after asking why and was hung up on.I will not stay here again. However great location, but there are many other hotels in area."
253,1961,"Nov 11 2008 	Great Location - Disappointing Hotel	The location of this hotel is great - right near Grand Central Station, near the UN, some nice restaurants, etc. The lobby is lovely, but the rooms leave much to be desired. While I expect small in NYC, I don't expect dirty. Terrible to feel that you need a shower after you've taken a shower. We couldn't pull the curtains without using shoes to hold them back because the curtains hung over the air vents which blew all of the dirt and dust from the curtains throughout the room. The vents in the air conditioning/heating unit needed serious cleaning. While I usually don't use in-room movies - no issue here since they didn't provide any. The cable was also limited and no in-room coffee makers. The concierge was a bit behind the times - when I asked if he could check us in on our airlines via the internet p he didn't have a clue - finally we were able to find the business center and for a fee were able to check-in from there. The positives: the beds were comfortable - and there are now comforters that seemed clean, but the dust ruffles could have used some cleaning; and, the hotel did provide umbrellas and luggage storage. For such a grand old hotel it was rather disappointing that they have not been able to keep the rooms up to the same standard as the lobby."
254,1961,"Nov 10 2008 	Need to clean the rooms	I travel alot and it is important to me to have a nice Hotel with clean rooms.The hotel itself is beautiful the staff exellent but the room was horrible. When we checked in the room had mold in the bathroom, black dirt in the shower head,rusted bathtub and a huge stain in the rug by the television, we called down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved, they changed our room same floor larger room cleaner but not great, bathroom was dirty,mold, floor was filthy, did not want to move again so we cleaned it ourselves and stayed. The ice machine was broken on that floor so everytime we needed ice we had to go up or down one floor.I was afraid I was going to come home with bedbugs.I loved this hotel but would not stay again. Cleanliness is important to me but apparently not important to the hotel, hopefully they willl fix this problem so other people can enjoy their stay. I spoke to Ramon about the problem and he told me he would get back to me, havent heard from him yet. For 360.00 a night I thought that I could at least have a clean room.I took photos of the room unfortunately I dont know how to post them."
255,1961,"Nov 6 2008	Great place to stay and location.	We stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel this past week and we were very pleased, the staff was really friendly. We were able to check in at 1:00 PM; our room had a crapy view on the third floor between the two towers and we could only see outside our window a flooding terrace, but we can live with that. The beds are really comfy and the pillows too. Everything was working and clean in the bed and the bathroom. Spacious closet. I think the price of the food is a little high but when you it is late, you can't walk anymore and are extremely tired, this is a good option. Food is good and service is great at the Restaurant, they go the extra mile for you.Right across the street there is an entrance to a passage to Grand Central Station and the little cafeteria Cos is a good place to get a good breakfast.I would stay again there."
256,1961,"Nov 4 2008 	Okay but a few hiccups	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt last Christmas, and it was a great experience. That is why I was disappointed with our stay there this weekend. We arrived at 2:45, after at seven hour drive, only to be told that we could not check-in until 3:30, despite the fact that check-in is at 3:00. The man at the front desk was completely unaccommodating and bordered on rude. He started our trip off on the wrong foot, and it was really frustrating.At 3:30 we were able to check-in to room 819. I was disappointed with the room, as it was slightly smaller and rather run down compared to the room we received last year. It really wasn't bad though. It was quite clean, and fairly comfortable.The Roosevelt is the warmest hotel I have ever stayed in! The temperature at night made it difficult for me to sleep. I had the same problem the first time I stayed there, and I am normally a very cold person. We had our AC cranked the entire time we were there and it was still hot!The hotel is very close to Times Square, Grand Central Terminal and shopping, but the area lacks character. It's an easy subway ride to more unique neighbourhoods though.Anyway I guess our stay was fine, but there were a few hiccups."
257,1961,"Nov 2 2008	Terrible experience!	As most reviews were quite positive about this hotel, we decided to stay here on our anniversary!What a mistake!!!Right from the beginning we were having problems. The person who checked us in was VERY arrogant and rude!As he wouldn't give us a nice deluxe room even though it was our anniversary and we came all the way from London, UK we asked for a room with a nice view.Well, our great view(as he described it!) was right in the corner overlooking another guest room!The room itself was very tiny. The bathroom was not better either, the paint was peeling off and the bathtub wasn't cleaned properly. We went back to reception to ask for a room with better standards and were told they are all the same! Shock of a lifetime and they were charging us $400 a night! Eventually we were moved to another room,same standard but at least cleaner.Our door had a huge gap at the bottom so you could clearly hear everything that was going on in the corridors.By this time we kind of accepted the fact that we were conned by the hotel but because it was nearly midnight and we were tired there was not much we could do.AS we were getting ready for bed we realized how cold it was so we called for an engineer to look at the heating system.He arrived within 5 minutes but as he was trying to fix the heater it blew!This meant we had to move room again in the middle of the night with 2 big suitcases and no help at all!At this point I was ready to start world war 3 at reception for all that they put us through.They clearly didn't want to argue so they upgraded us to a suite!Now that was probably worth the $400 as we got 2 bathrooms,a huge bedroom and an even bigger sitting room and dining room!I would not recomment this hotel to anyone!It's a rip off,the rooms are very dated and the staff have serious attitude problems."
258,1961,"Oct 31 2008 	Rude staff forced to have a smoking room	The location and the lobby/bar area is great. Aside from that, this place is a dump. Two girls at the front desk were so rude to us. They had given away our Queen Non Smoking room by the time we checked in (10pm), so instead they have us a room with a double bed on a SMOKING floor. The place reeked of stale smoke. We were told that our reservation doesn't guarantee a particular room (??). They couldn't find our reservation in the computer. I made the arrangements online, but they acted like it wasn't legitimate- it was their website!! They don't care if you complain- apparently they don't need or want your business!! They had already charged my credit card and it was late at night, or I would have left. But I'll take my $350/nt somewhere else next time."
259,1961,"Oct 31 2008 	Well located hotel	We stayed in this hotel as part of a package touring America. This hotel is very well located being a short walk from 5th Avenue and Time Square. We also found it possible to walk to all the other major sites including Empire state, Central park and the ferry to the statue of liberty although I would say that this was around three miles. The hotel is a traditional New York hotel and is fairly old fashioned. As we were staying four nights and we had asked for a double room the receptionist upgraded us although this didn't seem particularly special we did get a sneak look into some of the other rooms and were then quite happy with what we had been given. Rooms are small and fairly basic but are generally clean and surprisingly quiet considering you are in the middle of New York. It is hard to give an opinion on this hotel as I believe it is a victim of its traditional decor and design which does at least provide a good atmosphere of old style New York but also can look shabby. I probably would recommend this hotel but with a little reservation."
260,1961,"Oct 28 2008 	Nice hotel	After trawling through the Manhattan hotel reviews, we picked this one as it seemed to have more positive reviews than others. It is in a good location and easy to get hold of taxis, buses and subways.When we arrived about midday our room wasn't ready, we were told we were 24th in line for a room. There was no problem leaving our cases with the porter while we went out to explore, and our room was ready when we got back; they had told us to come back in a couple of hours and we did. There was no problem, either, looking after our cases when we checked out too because we didn't leave New York until much later in the day.We booked a CozyQueen, but when I told them it was our anniversary (true!) they upgraded us to a room with a king-size bed on the 6th floor. It was a nice good size room with an unspectacular view from the window.The weather was hot (low 70's in October!) and the air-conditioning was noisey. The choice was to have it on and be kept awake or turn it off and be baking hot. You could switch it on Low or High but both settings were noisey.The room was a good size and so was the bathroom. A small complaint about the bathroom was that the basin had a large crack in it, which didn't make it very hygenic. Also there was mold growing on the grouting of a few of the tiles around the bath, and the bath itself seemed to be pockmarked. Nothing very much to complain about, but the room wasn't cheap and I would expect better.We had good water pressure, but I overheard another guest in the lift say that on their floor higher up there was practically no pressure. The hotel did announce they were turning off the hot water for some maintenance during the day so that could have been part of the reason.The hotel has a Business Centre where you can use the Internet, but at a price. It was USD10.00 for 30 minutes or you could use it with a credit card where the minimum charge was USD3.00.Overall, a nice hotel where I would be happy to stay again."
261,1961,"Oct 24 2008 	World class	In short, this hotel is a dream come true. From the 16th to the 23rd of December last year my partner and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel NYC. Entering the hotel is like entering the set of a romantic movie. As you walk up the staircase into the lobby you are greeted by a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and a host of friendly staff and guests. The whole atmosphere sent butterflies to my stomach. I had looked forward to this trip so much, I was afraid encase I had set my expectations too high and was almost anticipating an anticlimax, but to my delight it was everything I had hoped it would be and more.After an extremely quick check in, (I mean literally 1 min), we made our way to the lift to take us to our new home for the week. Again there was a lovely surprise for us as we waited for the lift, some complimentary egg nog to further intensive the Christmas spirit.As we ascended to our room I could not have felt happier or more excited about the forthcoming week. This was most definitely not going to be any ordinary trip. I can honestly say Ive never been so far away from home and yet, felt so at home, (if that makes sense).We had booked to stay in the petite room and it was exactly that, however it was more than comfortable and the way in which the cleaning staff made up the rooms each day is to be highly commended. Every single day without fail, we were equipped with new towels and toiletries and the beds were always made to perfection, and that was in addition to the friendliness and politeness of the staff.In this review I must also mention the time and effort that the staff at the front desk put in to making our stay as enjoyable and fun packed as possible. We never felt lost. There was always a smiley face wanting to help, from Broadway tickets to the most time efficient ways of sight seeing, because lets be honest, its NY and there is almost too much to do. By the end of the week we were almost experts of where to go and what to see.MOST IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT TAKE THE BLUE SHUTTLE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!We booked out tickets in advance and the service they provided was adequate from the airport to the hotel; however the more important trip, getting us to the airport in time for our flight home was disastrous!!!!!!! The disastrous part being that they didnt turn up. We booked our bus an hour earlier than we needed to just encase anything should happen and Im so glad we did. Our panic was short lived however, as you guessed it, lol, the Roosevelt staff came to the rescue and offered us the hotel car to take us to the airport. It was actually the door staff who sorted this problem for us. Although I dont know the mans name he really was a gentleman and did everything in his power to help us. He is a credit to that hotel. We did have to pay for the car but it was only $70 to Newark and when the average taxi is $50 and it meant we didnt miss our flight I thought this was more than reasonable. The car was most comfortable and it was the perfect end to a most memorable and romantic holiday. Few Additional PointsDef do Woodbury CommonsDef do Madame TaussaudsDef do a couple of Broadway showsDef do The Statue of LibertyDef do Ellis IslandDef do The Empire State BuildingDef SHOPAnd appreciate your time there because it will fly in, unfortunately.AND DEF DONT TAKE THE BLUE SHUTTLE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
262,1961,"Oct 23 2008	very good hotel. big rooms. great service	location is great (45th and madison). 5 min from times sq.big room, nice bath.the hotel is renovated and is &quot;Old style&quot;, but very shiqu and clasic.the doormans were very helpful and volontiered themselvs to help.dont take their car to the airport. my driver tried to rip me off after the doorman said i'd have to pay a certien price (55$) he tried to take some more.overall - very good place."
263,1961,"Oct 19 2008 	Great stay!!!!!	We stayed at the Roosevelt over the weekend and it was great. At first I was hesitate to stay due to the recent dissatisfied reviews that were placed. I'm glad we didn't listen to the reviews because we had a great weekend. This was our second time staying at the Roosevelt and the first was also great. The moment you pull up to the curb you assisted with your bags and the car valet parked. We arrived three hours before check in and expected to just have our bags held and do some shopping until check in, but they had a room already available and checked us in immediately. Armondo at the front desk was terrific and a great help. We had drinks in the lobby and the martini's were excellent. Our room was clean and very roomy for NYC. The mattresses are new pillow top mattresses that are super comfy. We were on the 18th floor and had a view of the chrysler building which was nice. When we checked out on Sunday they held our bags and gifts that we bought in a secure room until we regretablely left for the day. From beginning to end we had a great stay at the Roosevelt and would not hesitate to book again. If your looking for a beautiful, clean hotel with a great location choose the Roosevelt you won't be disappointed."
264,1961,"Oct 17 2008	Awful experience	I really didn't like this hotel. The receptionist was really rude when she checked us in, and couldn't even bring herself to apologise when she put us in the wrong room. She just snapped and told us to 'find somewhere else if we aren't happy'. The manager and other male receptionists weren't much better either. So we decided just to put up with it and go and have a look at the rooms. Man, did we get a shock. The rooms are ugly and old, ditto the bathrooms. There was even green mould around the toilet. Really disgusting. We went downstairs to complain again about the room quality and told them we were leaving. They threatened for charge us for the entire stay, despite the fact that they put us in a smaller room than the one we booked and it was in a disgusting state. I rang my credit card company who said they would take legal action against The Roosevelt if they took any payment, so at least we didn't have to worry about that. The prices are a joke anyway, I have stayed in better bed and breakfasts. This certainly isn't deserving of 3 star status!"
265,1961,"Oct 17 2008	Loved it!	This was our 2nd trip to NYC and we stayed at The Roosevelt as a final part of our honeymoon trip before heading back to the UK. The hotel staff upgraded us to a 2-room suite which was a lovely touch! The entrance and bar areas are lovely - the rooms are a little dated and not up to the standard of the hotel public areas, but who spends much time in the hotel room when in New York!! We ate in the restaurant on our last evening which was superb - the food service etc... Would definitely stay here again + the hotel is in a fabulous location."
266,1961,Oct 17 2008 	Not so good	Great location at Grand CentralRoom smelled of roach sprayInside &quot;view&quot; (See photos)Mold in bathroomDuring shower tub wouldn't drain. Worst part is the water was brown! (See photo)Good size for NYC but for $379 I want the shower to work (or at least get clear water out of it!)
267,1961,"Oct 15 2008 	Great hotel great location	My girlfriend and I took our teen aged daughters to NYC to see a Broadway show and stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel. It was a great location - short walk from Grand Central, short walk to the theater district as well as shopping, restaurants, etc. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms were basic, but plenty large enough for the two double beds, desk, bureau, etc. The room and bathroom were clean although the bathroom could use some updating. The beds were very comfortable. I have already recommended it to a friend and would stay there again. We did not eat at the hotel as the menu was quite pricey compared to what we wanted to spend."
268,1961,"Oct 15 2008	Loved it	Just come back after staying at the Roosevelt Hotel for a week with 2 other adults and a small child.Hotel was great and staff were very friendly and helpful.Lobby was very grand, rooms not large, but this is what I have been told to expect all over New York.The location was great, just 1 block from Grand Central Station.Had the best time, and would love to stay at the hotel again in the future."
269,1961,Oct 7 2008 	Would not come back again	The front desk representative was not friendly and seemed unhelpful. I know good service when I receive it. This was unacceptable. The price was not cheap so I did expect better than the service I received. I would never stay there again.
270,1961,"Sep 30 2008	Grand Dame of Madison Avenue	The Roosevelt Hotel was named from Theodore Roosevelt. the 26th President of the US, in office 1901  1909. The hotel opened in 1924.I myself have stayed here several times and everything was all right. The only issue is the elevators. It could take a lot of time to get an elevator that isnt full of guests and luggage.Right in the heart of midtown. The location is great, a few minutes from Grand Central Station and Times Square.

271,1961,"Sep 29 2008 	Not all rooms are alike	My husband and I spent 3 nights in this hotel (9/25 through 9/28.) It was fine for us as we don't spend much time in our room while in New York, but to anyone who does they should remember to refuse Room 381. The view from that room is an eyesore....Dirty pipes, garbage, old bucket which looked like it was at one time filled with tar, a ladder, etc. We kept the drapes closed the entire time so we didn't have to look at it. This is directly on the other side of the window outside this room. Also, the carpet border and the wallpaper was hanging from the wall under the register exposing the bare plaster. Otherwise the room was very clean and everything functioned as it should. Housekeeping was great, check in was great. Location of the hotel is great. I did not make a verbal complaint regarding this as they'd just put someone else in the room, but did make this problem very clear on the comment card I left at the front desk when we left. As I said it was fine for us as we were in the room very little, but I really do feel it should be cleaned up."
272,1961,"Sep 25 2008 	Great experience at the Roosevelt	My wife and I stayed for a long weekend (Sep 12-14) at the Roosevelt on a trip to see the city for the first time. I chose this hotel because of the positive things I had heard about it as well as it's great location in the city. Neither let us down! Located at the corner of 45th and Madison, the hotel is so close to Times Square, just a couple blocks from Grand Central Station and only about 10 blocks or so from Central Park. We walked nearly every where we went and this location was perfect for it. As for our room, it was fantastic. We ended up getting an upgrade to a suite which had so much room for New York City we didn't know what to do with ourselves. The concierge was very helpful, the valet parking was convenient and the check-in, check-out service at the front desk was very smooth. All in all, if you want to truly get the New York City feel by walking out of your hotel to the heart of the city and you want to do it at a reasonable rate, I can't recommend this hotel enough to you. If a low rate is more important to you, I would suggest just staying outside the city as the public transportation system works very well and would allow for little trouble if you're looking to save money on your stay."
273,1961,"Sep 23 2008	really liked the Roosevelt	We recommend this hotel. Almost all NYC hotel prices seem high, compared to other big cities. That being said, the Roosevelt did exceed our expectations, and we will go back. Room was adequate size with very nice amenities. Very clean room and bathroom. Friendly staff. Easy check in and check out. Lovely lobby. Quiet. Super location."
274,1961,"Sep 19 2008 	Great Location Great Hotel!	The hotel has a great location, about 2 blocks from fifth avenue! It is very good value for money as when we arrived the christmas tree was still up and looked amazing! The staff are very helpful and deserve tips, un-like alot of other places we have stayed! Room was very clean and the rooms are quite quiet considering the location."
275,1961,"Sep 18 2008 	Beautiful Lobby	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in August of 2008. The lobby is beautiful and the concierge and hotel staff were extremely helpful. But, our room on the 4th floor was not reflective of the rest of the restoration that was done on this Hotel. Our room was small and the furniture was old. The bathroom was also very small and old (old tiles and wallpaper) with taps that turned almost completely around to shut off. We had an extremely old and noisy air conditioner and our view was old rusted out air ducts directly below our window. Aside from our room, the location of this hotel is great and we had a great time in New York!!"
276,1961,"Sep 17 2008 	Perfectly WONDERFUL	The Roosevelt is a great hotel. I recently stayed for a long weekend and had a wonderful experience. We could not figure out who the people were leaving bad reviews on here. We arrived early and checked our luggage with the bell captain. We had a cozy queen which was larger than I had anticipated. It was perfect for our needs. Everything was very clean and the bed very comfortable. The air conditioner was a bit noisy, and we were close to the elevator and vending machines so we could hear people talking in the hallway but it really wasn't disruptive. The hotel is in a great location, close to Times Square and Grand Central (subway). We did not eat at the hotel but we did have a drink at the rooftop bar which was lovely. I highly recommend this hotel for the price. I will definitely book at the Roosevelt again!"
277,1961,"Sep 15 2008 	Magnificent hotel	We have just returned from a week stay at the Roosevelt hotel New York. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such kindness and incredible service before. Upon arrival to the hotel we were welcomed by friendly staff eagar to make our stay enjoyable. Also to our suprise we were upgraded to a suite (in celebration of our wedding anniversary, the suite was almost as big as our house!) . The restaurants and bars including the roof top bar were great. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday!"
278,1961,"Sep 15 2008 	No problems despite concerns	We stayed at the Roosevelt for 6 nights from 30 August 2008.I had read hotel reviews of New York hotels til they were driving me mad - basically everywhere has both good and bad reviews. In the end I decided you can't be influenced too much by someone's bad experience, so I decided to book the Roosevelt despite having some concerns about the reviews about theft from the rooms. The reasons for choosing it were general central location, proximity to Grand Central Station, right sort of price range and size, and availability on the nights I wanted.Basically we had a great week there with no problems at all. We arrived too early for check in (1pm) but they did check us in no problem. The room was absolutely fine - two nice big comfortable beds. Air conditioning and safe worked fine, so did toilet and the shower was brilliant. Maybe not much space to hang stuff up or spread out cases but that is minor quibble.I'm pleased to say suffered no thefts or other problems. It was quiet, room cleaning fine, very little contact with other guests or staff so very much a 'hands off' feeling to it, especially when we took to getting the elevator from the lower Arcade level. Elevators were busy but no particularly long waits. The shop was useful for drinks for the night and was open late, also you could get ice from a machine to keep your drinks cool in.We never tried the breakfast in the end but had one evening meal in the restaurant behind the lobby - food was perfectly okay, I had a 'New York Strip' steak and New York cheesecake.Overall I would say our stay was a great success and I enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it, however seeing other people's gripes about bad service etc I think the conclusion is that there's an element of luck involved in whether you have a good experience or not. I think I would advise not to get too hung up about reviews and don't get too stressed about everything having to be perfect.Oh, and I didn't see a single cockroach anywhere in New York!"
279,1961,"Sep 12 2008	Loved the roosevelt	To book my reservation i contaated the hotel directly..i stayed for two nights on sept 4 to the 6 for 250 per night..everything was perfect, the room was perfect, the bathrrom was perfect also. i could not ask for more.. i was very socked..i would definitely stay here again and recommend thiks hotel to anyone. also the roomservice was great..a little pricey but worth it..during the process of check out if you need a taxi they will make sure they provide it for you. i had a cozy queen.. it was a corner room so i believe that made it a little more spacious im not sure but the room was a rather large.i was shocked considering all the reviews that ive read said that the rooms were small idk..i got to go ino the room beside me and it was huuuuge..it was also a corner room.. this hotel is in the center of anything. great locaiton and easy access to subway..walking distance to times square..just great hotel for a good price in nyc.. hope it doesnt go up. i wil be returning :)"
280,1961,"Sep 12 2008 	Lovely Hotel and Very Convenient	I found the hotel room and the room staff were excellent. Room and bathroom very clean and attended too every morning. However my gripe lies with the male receptionist on my arrival.The conversation went as follows:-Are you checking in? YesI will need I.D. e.g. Passport and Credit Card? You are staying seven days? YesRoom 1102I have had a long journey (13 hours) and feeling very tired and not thinking ask the rceptionist how do I find Room 1102. His reply was &quot;on the elevator behind me &quot;. End of conversation .On checking out of the hotel I had problems using the bedroom phone. I was trying to contact the shuttle bus service to confirm my pick-up time ,without success. I contacted Billy the Concierge and explained my difficulties to him. He informed me that my bedroom phone was probably deactivated because I was checking out . However he refused to make a local phone call because they dont do business with that particular Shuttle Bus Company. He referred me to the local payphone(which was out of order). I eventually found a payphone in Grand Central Station,which is two blocks away. Two Senior Citizens"
281,1961,Sep 9 2008 	Would go back to the Roosevelt	Just returned fromNew York where we stayed at The Roosvelt Hotel which was just around the corner from Grand Central Station so was in a great position. The hotel lobby is very grand and can get quite busy. The room we had was very comfortable and clean and was quite as we did not overlook the road. The staff were ok but the bell boys were very friendly. New York is not as cheap as at Christmas time as there are very few sales but if you look hard enough there are some bargains to be had. If we were lucky enough to go back to New York we would stay at the Roosevelt again. One word of warning the roof top bar Mad46 is expensive and full of workers and we were asked (told) to move from our table which did not have a reserved sign on. Not a welcoming place.
282,1961,"Sep 8 2008 	will never stay there again	The hotel was nice enough upon arrival - old style architecture, grand lobby, etc. However, the staff was rude, I was treated as a 2nd rate customer for booking the room through hotwire. There were a lot of unnecessary references to the 'type of room' I had requested (eg instead of saying 'your room is not ready yet' they said, 'the type of room you requested is not ready yet' - I did not request anything special, just A room...).The kicker is that I had NO HOT WATER in the morning. The bath tub faucet was broken (I could not turn it to the hot water). I went into the shower, waited patiently for about 5 minutes to make sure the hot water was not coming (it never did), and then called the cleaning service (conceirge desk was not available). They transferred me to a manager, who was not terribly apologetic. I felt like I was complaining about my TV screen being fuzzy (which it was btw), not about NOT HAVING HOT WATER, a very basic amnety at any hotel. They oferred to MOVE me to another room which just infuriated me even more because I was standing naked, draped in a towel, dripping wet, with only 30 minutes to get ready before meeting my friends for breakfast. I thought they were joking! Moving rooms?!?! I ended up taking a cold shower, going downstairs and asking for a refund. They said they could not give me one since my room was prepaid. They had the audacity to offer me discount for my future stays - as if I would EVER stay there again. I hope hotwire takes them off their list of hotels. I have booked through hotwire many times before and never had a bad experience. In addition to this 'minor problem' of no hot water, the wall paper was peeling, the a/c was loud (a window unit), the TV was in fact, fuzzy, there were stains on the toilet seat, and the staff was rude. The bell boy coerced a tip out of me, which I found REALLY rude. I would have given him a tip anyways, but he did not even give me a chance. My recommendation is to steer clear of this hotel - there are much better options around NYC."
283,1961,"Sep 7 2008 	Loved it!	The Roosevelt was perfect for my first visit to NYC! Beautiful hotel, convenient location, helpful staff, overall a wonderful experience. We received the free room upgrade as was mentioned several times on here, found it to be clean and though certainly not huge it was quite large enough for our needs. On our last night there we requested a change of rooms because my children were joining us and we needed two double beds; the staff was incredibly accommodating. The only complaint I have is that there are no coffeemakers in the room, something we're used to in most hotels. There was also not a mini fridge, again something that is rather common, but these were small issues and would certainly not prevent me from staying there again. These items would have been convenient, however, especially when storing leftovers from the fabulous restaurants we dined in! I refused to pay for Starbucks coffee in the hotel lobby, choosing instead to walk to the restaurant across the street and pay $1.00 less per cup! Overall, I was very pleased with the Roosevelt and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
284,1961,"Sep 3 2008 	Wouldn't stay again	I stayed at The Roosevelt for 5 nights 27th Aug- 1st Sept. First impressions were good, nice lobby etc..Check-in was quick, given room on 3rd floor, I'd booked a Superior room 2x double ( as we are a family of 4 )RoomThe room was clean enough, although very tired and dated. The linen was clean and changed regularly, clean towels everyday. Nice new flat screen TV. The bathroom was dated and dirty, the bath looked like it had been painted and the paint had all chipped away. Didn't use the bath, only the shower.Overall, the service was good, but I wouldn't return to The Roosevelt. Spent my last night in New York @ The Hilton New York, were I stayed last year. I wished I'd spent my whole trip there."
285,1961,"Sep 2 2008	Terrible Customer Service	I just want to say that this hotel's customer service on the ohone is the worst.. The operatoer NEVER (and I've called many times) tells you that she is transfering uyour call to sales, reservations, etc, etc.The reservation agents all sound as if they rather be somewhere else and they are bothered that you are calling them.Anyway, the experience would be much better is they made you feel welcomed. Not a big task and bvelieve me it goes a long way.What I dont understand is how their managers do not kow this or if they do I guess they just dont care.. because I would call my own hotel as a secret caller and feel the treatment for myself.. if it were my hotel."
286,1961,"Sep 2 2008 	Average	Upon arriving around 1pm we were informed that we couldn't check into the room until 3pm, which was fine. We went through the checkin process and left out bags with the bell boy, grabbed some lunch and returned around 5pm. We went to collect our room key and were told that the room we booked wasn't available (cosy queen) but we could have another room with two twin beds instead. We explained that we wanted the room with the queen bed but the receptionist wouldn't give us a time scale as to when it would be ready. Overall his attitude was quite rude and it seemed like he didn't really care. We decided just to go for the double twin because we were tired from the flight. Not the best first impression of the hotel. The main lobby of the reception is very nice and always busy which adds a vibe to the hotel. But once you get upto the floors which house the room, the decor is very tired. Old furniture, torn wallpaper and just generally out of date. The room is pretty much the same, our carpet was very dirty, beds fortunately were very good and TV a newish LCD panel.The bathroom was again just adequate, very old decor but at least it was clean. If you can get a good deal for the hotel, then it's worth it. But don't expect much from it."
287,1961,"Aug 31 2008 	Over-rated!	What can I say - we stayed for a week and it was awful! Supposed to be a 4/5 star hotel but it was dreadful. When we arrived the bell boys grab your bags climb 3 steps (not even to the recetion) and hands out for a tip! Not a good start! When we got to the reception desk I was told there was a 3hour wait for our room because of a staffing problem, When we explained that I had a migraine there was no interest - not even an offer of a glass of water! Eventually got to our room which was right next to the lift - just what you need with a migraine and the thought of putting up with the noise all week was too much so my husband went to the recetion to request another room. After speaking to 3 different people and argueing politely we were offered another room. On arrival to this one, the toilet was broken, electrics were hanging out of the wall and the air con worked only in a very noisy fashion. So another trip downstairs - by this time I felt absolutely dreadful and so husband went again to reception and got pretty stroppy. The 3rd room we were offered was only adequate - if you could ignore the grubby carpet, bubbling plastic in the bathroom, next to the cleaners cupboard and overlooking the back vents of the hotel kitchens! But it was clean! The website looks amazing - the reception certainly is really impressive but it would seem that once you are pased the hallowed grounds of recetion the rooms have another life! Given that we viewed 3 on our visit, I would guess that we were past just being 'unlucky' in choice of rooms. Most of the staff were unhelpful - to the point of being downright rude but the housekeepers were always pleasant and seemed to do a good surface job. Conseirge were great too and really helpful. Maybe the managers need to look to them for some customer relations training! We left a letter of complaint but got no reply. We emailed a letter of complaint upon our return - and got no reply. Then they sent a customer satisfaction survery (what a laugh) to which we replied very negetivly - but still no reply. We got an email to say that since we had posted negetive feedback they would be in touch - we are still waiting! The best laugh is that they still send me emails inviting us to 'visit again soon'!!! We have stayed in NYC several times but this is one place we will absolutly not be returning to - even if offered for free! Our next stay will be back to 'The Intercontinental - The Barclay' which justifies its 5 star rating."
288,1961,"Aug 29 2008 	not impressed	hotel was very nice but the staff were not helpful or friendly, i found them very rude, you are in a strange country and you want to ask questions they did not want to help or direct you in the right direction, i felt i was bothering them, i found the staff very snobbish.hotel was near shops which was great, the shower was not very good, room was very clean.i did not eat at the hotel, too expensive, i took food back to hotel in the evening, but when my room was cleaned, the cleaning staff left a card on my bed for me to see about room service and the prices, i take it they saw the food wrappers in the bin but it is my choice if i ate at the hotel or not.i would not go back to this hotel again, the view from the room was a tower block, but when i checked in was told i had a nice view over looking the street which was not true,i did leave a customer form saying how rude the staff were i guess they will just bin it, that is there attitude they just did not care. i payed decent money to stay at this hotel and i expected a good service which i did not get..eat at grand central station food court which was reasonable.take a trip to china town, sample the food which was fantastic and cheaptime square was an experience go when it is dark the lights are out of this world.i felt safe walking in the day and night, new york is a must to see designer clothes are cheaper and the trainers.would go back to ny but would stay in a different hotel."
289,1961,"Aug 28 2008 	Super hotel - great location	We just returned from a week in the Roosevelt and we loved it. The midtown location was so convenient for everything - we were in walking distance of the ESB, Rockefeller Centre, etc and, of course, Grand Central Station was just round the corner so we had easy access to the subway for slightly more remote locations. You're in the business district so it was relatively quiet at night - but 10-15 minutes walk away you're in TImes Square!The lobby of the hotel is most impressive. If I hadn't already been told about it, I would have thought we'd got the wrong hotel since it looked far more expensive than we'd paid. The staff were pleasant and polite. They'd made a mistake and booked us into a smoking room - and to give us a non-smoking room they upgraded us at no cost. Our room was very spacious - 2 very big &amp; utterly comfy beds. Bathroom was ok - although the shower didn't drain very quickly (a minor gripe and not something that bothered us). No tea/coffee making facilities in the room but a fridge in which we stored water &amp; juice. The air-con was a little noisy but after a night or two I found it rather soothing! The bar serves lovely food - a chicken club sandwich easily fed the two of us and was delicious. There's a newly opened rooftop bar which tends to attract Madison Avenue types but offers nice views.We loved New York and we loved the hotel so much we're saving up to go again next year!"
290,1961,"Aug 28 2008 	Nice hotel nice location	Me and a friend stayed at the Roosevelt for 6 nights in August, and our first impressions were good. The hotel is in a good location (near Grand Central, NY Public library, 5th Avenue - good shops and about a 10 min walk to times square). As we are from England, we were not used to the hot climate, fortunately taxis were relatively cheap to get around. Checking in was quite simple although the receptionist was very unpleasant - he tossed our key across the desk and had a bad attitude. Additionally, the safe in our room was broken, but after calling security this was fixed promptly and the security guy also gave us free breakfast! (We were on a room only basis - breakfast is quite good but I would probably get sick of it everyday - we usually just went to cafes - cafe metro is quite good for breakfast and only about $5.) Additionally the hair dryer was broke in the room and this was never repaired.The cleaning service was quite good and the maids were friendly and actually took notice of the 'do not disturb' sign - this is quite often ignored in other hotels I have stayed in. The hotel rooms were average, we stayed in a 'petite room', 'petite' being true. The room included a large plasma TV with quite a few good channels - movie channels, MTV, BBC etc, and ironing facilities etc. You should also look into the cheapest way of getting to the hotel from the airport, from JFK we got ripped off and ended up paying $90 when the guy had told us it would cost $50. Another man running his private taxi business practically ran away with my suitcase in an attempt to rip us off. Yellowcabs are usually quite cheap for getting around so I'd probably suggest that. Another thing, is EVERYONE expects you to tip them, coming from a country were tipping is not often necessary I found this strange - one guy who gave us a piece of paper with how much luggage we had loitered round for a few minutes until we gave him some dollars, additionally restaurants sometimes add this onto your bill or state that 15-20% is sufficient. Points of interest I would recommend would be to see a Broadway show (we saw Mamma Mia which was excellent and funny), Statue of liberty, Empire state building (good view at night and that is when ques are shorter) top of the rockerfeller centre is good through the day as you get a great view of central park. Central park is a lovely place too and we spent a nice day just walking round, visited strawberry fields and went on the rowing boats near the boathouse. Restaurants I would recommend are Tavern on the Green in central park (outdoor and pretty with lanterns and live music, nice to end the night on a horse and carriage ride which is from $40), Ellen's stardust diner near the theatres in Times Square is quite good for younger people too, this is where all of the waitresses are trying to make it on broadway and serve and sing - the food isn't that good but it's a different experience and a lot of the child customers enjoyed it. Overall I would recommend the Roosevelt and I would definitely return. If you have any questions regarding the Roosevelt you may send me a message and I'd be happy to help."
291,1961,"Aug 25 2008 	Nice Hotel	I stayed for 9 nights at the Roosevelt this month with my wife and my 8 year old daughter. The room was big, comfy, clean ( although one day i had to leave a note to the housekeeping to clean the dust.). The furniture really needs an update. If you leave a tip the sevice is more well done, i left 2 dollars a day to the housekeeping. A nice surprise was the newspapper everyday (except weekend) at the door. Another good thing were the aminities every day, they even gave mouthwash solution. Although we were in 14 floor we still heard a lot of noise from the street, but its NY the city doesnt reaaly sleeps. I would stay here again for sure."
292,1961,"Aug 22 2008 	Great stay for the price	We booked the Roosevelt for its reasonable price. It is convenient to Grand Central and Times Square. Our flight arrived early and they let us check in early, which we appreciated. We were by an elevator, but we weren't bothered by any noise. The staff was helpful. The atmosphere was more classic. A good deal for the price."
293,1961,"Aug 18 2008 	It's fine	I had a quick stay at the Roosevelt this past weekend and I must say I was a little disapointed.LOCATION-Perfect for Midtown at 45th and Madison. I think it's a great location. There are plenty of restaurants around and all the transportation is close. Bryant Park (my favorite spot in NYC) is just about 5 blocks away.LOBBY-When you arrive you are almost blow away by the stately beauty of the lobby and public areas. Almost stunning. It's been beautifully restored.ROOMS-Mine was tiny indeed. Actually it was so tiny there wasn't even a desk for my laptop. But hey this is NYC. The bedding is comfortable with nice linens and pillows. There was also a great flat-screen television.Okay, so far I have only stated the positives.....Well, this is one of those hotels that LOOKS and SEEMS great at first glance. And really for all practical purposes, it's OK.......However, if they don't start to keep this place up, it's going to be nothing more than a run-down tourist hotel within another 10 or 15 years.Here's my list:-Old slow evelators (need to me modernized)-Almost ever door on my hallway had scuff marks and dirt on them. This shows a real lack of attention to cleaning.-Major scuff mark on the bedskirt in my room.-Many, many spots in the hallway carpet with rips and stains.-HORRIBE bathroom plumbing. The toilet would not flush properly due to insifficient pressure. The shower was one of the worst I have ever had. Did not take one OK shower. Once it was scalding hot, and twice ice cold. No in-between temps - even after I spend 10-15 minutes playing with it.-Staff that wasn't into their jobs at all. As an exmple, once on a packed elevator, a bellhop counted all his money while riding instead of smiling or making eye contact with guests.-Security was a bit lacking. At night, they have the evelator bank was &quot;roped off&quot; however twice no one ever asked to see my room key.If you get a good deal on the place, I say go for it. With the exception of the shower issue, I think only very experienced travelers would find issues.The hotel management just needs to get this hotel on it's P's and Q's and it would be fabulous!"
294,1961,"Aug 9 2008 	Good location	Good lacation for Broadway and theatres, not a bad place"
295,1961,"Aug 8 2008 	Great Location	New York accomodation is New York accomodation. Very expensive and very tiny rooms. I have been to NY 16 times now, and unless I have the big budget to stay at Omni Berkshire (which is a beautiful hotel - however now I tend to save the money and put it towards shopping instead!), I am always changing hotels as the prices keep increasing and the last hotel had faults that steer me away. The Roosevelt was a relatively nice hotel for the price and location. Rooms were nicely decorated and they were very clean. The location was perfect for getting around the city and for shopping! My only small crticism was the noise from the street - I have stayed in alot worse in NY, but this wasn't completely sound proof either. Its a nice hotel if you are on a budget, you want something nice, but can't afford to stay in the rooms $400+ a night, based on this, I would recommed the Roosevelt. But its not the 4 star experience you would usually get in another city or country - but hey that's NY for you!"
296,1961,"Jul 31 2008	Roosevelt was great!	Loved the Roosevelt. Got summer special on room for a &quot;cozy queen&quot;, but they upgraded it to king size without me even asking. Room was big (not just by NY standards), bathroom fine, two windows overlooking the city, and quiet. The location was amazing - right next to Grand Central Station and an easy walk to Times square. We'll stay there every time we go to the city!"
297,1961,"Jul 28 2008 	Somewhat Tired Tourist Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for one night on July 24th, 2008. This is an older hotel with very slow elevators. Location is not bad for midtown. Breakfast buffet is great, but some may find it expensive ($30). Room rate is quite reasonable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are good sized, clean, but decor is old fashioned. However, my air conditioning was supurb. Walked into the room on a very hot day and it was refreashingly cool. Problem was that at night, the air conditioner leaked on to the carpet, creating a large wet spot to walk through when getting in and out of bed. Room safe did not work. No honor bar in room and vending machine in hall alcove did not work, so not possible to buy water for room. Hard to believe that housekeeping did not know about the wet spot in front of the air conditioner. Bathroom was small but adequate for one person. this is a huge hotel -- must have 1000 rooms or more and was built a long time ago. It could do with a major remodel, but my guess is that the owners are happy to continue with it as is, since it largely caters to tourists who are looking for an inexpensive, well located hotel. As a business person, I probably would not stay here again, but if you are looking for a well located hotel that is simply OK, then this might be a good choice."
298,1961,"Jul 28 2008 	Great Location Great Smaller Hotel	I couldn't have been more pleased when arriving at The Roosevelt. It it a smaller hotel, with great staff. Rooms were simple, clean, and large for New York city. The location was perfect- right in the theatre district, and walking district to &quot;restaurant row,&quot; tons of great restaurants, all different varieties."
299,1961,"Jul 25 2008 	Fabulous Hotel Great Location	I booked The Roosevelt for both location and price and was more than satisfied with the accommodations and service. The room (two doubles) was virtually the same as I'd seen in pictures, with comfortable beds, crisp white linens, soft duvets, and a 32&quot; LCD flat panel television. We were surprised when we opened the closet to find that it was a walk-in - amazing in NYC! The bathroom floors and tub were a bit dated, but this was made up for by how clean everything was. The linens and towels were fresh each day; a welcome treat after a long day of walking around the city.The Roosevelt is in a great location, allowing you to walk to numerous attractions, including Broadway and Times Square. In addition, Grand Central Terminal is two short blocks away, which is convenient for hopping on the subway. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. One helpful hint - if booking through a major travel deal website, you may want to call the hotel to confirm that the right type of bed was assigned. In our case it wasn't, but the front desk staff were great in getting that sorted out, despite the fact that it wasn't their fault."
300,1961,"Jul 25 2008	Usually fine but be aware..	I stay at the Roosevelt almost every time I go to NYC for business. This is mostly because we get a special rate through our client and that makes it cheaper than any other hotel I can find. However, cheap rate incentive aside, I would probably choose to stay at the Roosevelt anyway. Having stayed here 10+ times over the last year, I have hardly ever had anything to complain about. One thing to note: the rooms are really a crap shoot. Personally, I like the charm of a hotel where the rooms are not all the same cookie cutter shape and size. But I admit that some of the rooms at the Roosevelt are small and feel cramped. I also know that some of the bathrooms have stall showers with only a small lip separating them from the rest of the bathroom, though I have never had anything but a tub with shower in the bathroom. The one time I have had a problem with my room was when I was given one on the third floor, which should be non-smoking, yet my room reeked of cigarette smoke. I think it might have been because I was on a low floor, some of the odor might have come up from the street. At any rate, I requested a different room on a higher floor and they accommodated me right away.Within the last few months they have added nice flat screen TV's to all the rooms. The carpet could really stand to be replaced in most areas of the hallways and guest rooms, but it's not really bothersome. Room service is usually prompt and professional, and the same goes for the staff in the lounge downstairs. They have also recently opened a rooftop lounge called Mad 46, which I haven't checked out yet but I heard it's nice (when the weather cooperates). Overall I enjoy the Roosevelt regardless of its few small issues."
301,1961,"Jul 25 2008 	it's okay	Nothing special. I was here mainly for business during the NYC Marathon, which makes things a little bit crazy. Staff wasnt too friendly, big room (you dont get a small room for being America) small bathroom though.it' s okay I guess, it is clean and well located but overrated."
302,1961,"Jul 21 2008 	Room Snafu but wonderful location	I had a love/hate relationship with Roosevelt. Let start off from the beginning, I had booked two doubles as I was taking my nephew on this trip for a graduation present. I had called the hotel in the morning to notify them that I would be checking in late due to a late flight. We got to the hotel around midnight and I was told that there were no double available and that we could have a queen. I explained to them that this was in unacceptable and they said they couldnt do anything to accommodate us. We asked for a rollaway bed, however that wouldnt work due to the room being so small. I checked back the following morning and night and they still claimed that there was nothing available. We requested additional bedding and my nephew slept on the floor the first two nights. They finally were able to move us to our two double on our last night there. Both rooms were very tiny, but very clean. I thought that the painting and carpet could be updated, but it really wasnt that bothersome. Our first room was a handicap room and the shower was awful, we got the entire bathroom wet and water also went out into the room because of the drains not working properly. The bathroom was much better in the second room. I thought the beds were very comfortable and were much needed after walking in the heat all day. The pillows were very stiff and not to comfortable. Each of the rooms had a great flat screen. The noise from the street below could be heard very easily, however that wasnt too big of deal to me as we were so tired from being on the go all day and I fell asleep in spite of the noise. The staff was very pleasant even when I wasnt too nice after being upset over our room snafu. The concierge and bell hops were all quick, nice and easy to deal with. We didnt see our maids, but our room was spotless when we came back each day.I loved the location, this was the best part of the hotel and ALMOST made up for my nephew having to sleep on the floor for two days. Youre away from the chaos that is Times Square, however your close enough to walk if that is something you want to spend a lot of time at. The hotel is super close to Grand Central Station and it made it great for using the subway. 5th avenue is a block away and the Chysler Building is very close. I felt like we had a great Central hub for everything we wanted to do.If the hotel could have straightened our hotel situation room out sooner I would have been happier, I wasnt looking to be compensated or anything like that. I just wanted the room that I booked."
303,1961,"Jul 15 2008 	Great breakfast with Tomas the best ever server!	My friends and I always stay at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City when we go there for a long weekend to see as many plays as we can squeeze into the weekend. Almost five years ago, we met Tomas, who served us breakfast. With such good service, we went back two to three times per year to the same hotel and feel like family. We've watched as Tomas' son finished high school and gets ready to attend college. Through Tomas, we've met many people in the hotel and have shared the information with many friends, who are now regularly visiting the Roosevelt and Tomas. One man can make a difference in making a stay in a big city feel so special. We feel like we are treated like royalty at the Roosevelt, all because of Tomas! Stop by there and tell him that the Florida ladies sent you!"
304,1961,"Jul 15 2008	Fantastic hotel fantastic location!	I just returned from a 6 night stay in NYC at the Roosevelt. It was an incredible experience! The hotel was in a perfect location and was beautiful! We had a free room upgrade (I had read on Trip-Advisor that many people get those) and our room was quite large and very confortable. The 2 queen beds and the down conforters were very awesome with lots of pillows! The Bath &amp; Body Works complimentary samples in the bathroom were nice, the air conditioner worked well and our maid was lovely. She was friendlty, had a beautiful smile and was very professional. I was prepared to tip for storing our bags and getting them out, (another tip I got from Trip-Advisor), but the bellmen were very appreicative and gracious when I tipped them. When you arrive, come to the 45th street entrance and stay on the lower level, bypassing the stairs up to the lobby. If you go to the right and down a short hallway, you'll come to the elevators. You can take those up to the lobby. I struggled getting my heavy bag up the main stairs to the lobby the first night. Grand Central Station has an entrance right across the street and there's a wonderful Cafe-Deli next to the entrance. Turn right out of the 45th street entrnace and walk up 45th. It goes straight to Times Square (It's about 4-5 blocks away). If you exit the 46th St. side of the hotel, the Waldorf Astoria is one block away to your right and up one block. We were able to figure out the subway system (1st time for anything like this for us!), but walking was easier from the Roosevelt. We quickly and easliy got to Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Buliding, Central Park, Times Square, most of the shows we went to in the Theater District and all the bus tours we went on. Great location and very helpful people everywhere."
305,1961,"Jul 15 2008 	Great location!	We stayed over at the Roosevelt beginning of May. The Hotel is splendid, huge entrance, very impressive. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room wasn't very big but when you visit NYC you don't stay in your room all day. So for us it was perfect! The bed was a king size with loads of different pillows, the room was cleaned everyday. In other word, we enjoyed staying there and we would probably go back."
306,1961,"Jul 14 2008 	Decent hotel	Stayed a night at this hotel in July 2008 - and had a decent enough experience. The location is good, on the corner of 45th and Madison, it's definitely at the centre of things if that is what you want from your New York Hotel.The bedroom was fairly small, and the bathroom also. The bed was reasonably comfortable. The TV was very modern but the rest of the furnishing were quite old.I wouldn't normally comment on something as trivial as a lift, but for some reason the lifts in this hotel were achingly slow, and very old also. Overall, ok, but I wouldn't be rushing back here in a hurry.One thing to note- the concierge will try and sell you a car to JFK for $73 - don't take it - taxis have a flat rate of $45 + toll + tip (so around $60). And you can get a private car for around the same rate."
307,1961,"Jul 10 2008 	Loved the Roosevelt	This is a beautiful, classic hotel! We found a very reasonable rate on the hotel website ($179 for a cozy queen) and after reading the reviews on tripadvisor, I was really worried. The other reviews are completely wrong! Our room was clean, quite big for NYC and had THE most comfortable bed! The bathroom was small but normal for an older hotel, and there really was plenty of room for toiletries and such. The staff were great...they were all very helpful and accommodating - they made us feel like VIPs everywhere we went. They have a nice lounge/bar right next to the lobby There's also a great new rooftop bar that you must visit, even if you don't stay at the hotel. Not only that, but you are across the street (literally) from Grand Central! It was so easy getting around town, I think we only took a cab twice and those were late at night. I really can't say anything bad about this hotel. We can't wait to go back!"
308,1961,"Jul 10 2008 	Splendid Hotel!!!!!!!!!	My husband and I have just returned from the Roosevelt Hotel. This was our second visit to this hotel, and I have to say it was just as special the second time around. I would recommend the Roosevelt for its fantastic location (on Madison Ave, Midtown). It seems a higher standard than the price suggests. The staff are extremely helpful, especially the concierge. We were able to leave our bags securely both on arrival (we got there before the check-in time) and departure (ours was a late evening flight home). The room was on the small side (a Queen), however, it was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom. Although in New York's standards the 18th floor isn't high, the view from rm 1802 was quite magical at night. Our room overlooked Madison Ave, but we weren't disturbed by any noise. The one down side was that our bedding wasn't changed in four days however, it was Independence Day weekend and fully booked! Can't say any more except 'Go stay at the Roosevelt'"
309,1961,Jul 9 2008 	Very nice hotel	I booked this room on expedia for a great rate of $125 a night over Memorial day weekend. I was alittle skeptical because I had read all the reviews and alot of people complained about the air conditions not cooling properly and being very loud. We did not have any problems with the air condition it worked just fine and we did not have alot of noise from it. The room and bathroom are small but were very clean. Great location to walk to everything. I would definitely stay here again. Very nice!!
310,1961,"Jul 7 2008 	Really	We just visited this hotel for three days during a business trip. Although the lobby is very nice, we found our room very small even for New York City standards for the price charged. In addition our bathroom was so small there was little or no room even for a shaving kit. Other concerns were: 1) We were staying on the 6th floor and on several occasions it took so long for the elevator to arrive we decided to take the stairs. 2) While there my wife had a cold and I wanted a cup of hot water to mix her medicine in. When I called room service they said it would cost $5 to bring me a cup plus the charge for the water. I thought they were joking, they were not. I went downstairs to the bar to simply get a cup and the bartender flat refused to give or sell me one saying I had to get it from room service. I next asked at the front desk and they said try a deli down the street. Overall if sked if I would stay here again, I would say no."
311,1961,"Jul 7 2008 	Lovely hotel rooms slightly small	My Mum decided to treat me to a trip to NYC for my 21st birthday and booked for us to stay at the Roosevelt. The trip was extremely exciting for both of us as we had never been to America and had only ever travelled internationally seperately, so we really wanted our first trip together to be a good one. Upon arrival at The Roosevelt , we were very impressed with the lobby and bar area that you first come across. It has a grand and sophisticated feel, but was comfortable.The bellboys and receptionists were very helpful. We checked in very quickly, without any fuss. Our room was up in the 7th floor, so we had assistance in the lift with our luggage (tipped obviously). The entrance area to the floor was clean and tidy, if not ever so slightly out of date on decor. The room itself was very nice, not particularly huge, but very comfortable. My Mum had ungraded our room to a Superior room, which meant we had a Large double bed each, with various other upgraded amenities. Bathroom was basic, but clean, which is all we could have asked for. We were supplied with a safe in the wardrobe, which could not be moved and set to lock with your own personalised code. We kept our cash in here, as well as passports, as it seemed very secure. Location wise, the Roosevelt is quite central. Grand Central Station is right around the corner and the Empire State is around a 15 minute walk DownTown. In the opposite direction its around a 15 minute walk to Time Square, but taxi's are easy to come by. The Doormen at the front of the hotel are more than happy to flag you one down. On the second night, very tired after a busy day sightseeing, we decided to have dinner in the hotel bar, followed by a few cocktails. The food was fresh and tasty, but a little expensive. Cocktails were large, as my Mum soon realised when she passed out on one of the beds after having just one!!There is a fantastic deli opposite the hotel, which do a great selection of breakfasts, I would strongly suggest anyone visiting the Roosevelt go there. Generally this was a pleasant and well located hotel, with friendly staff. I would most definately go back to the Roosevelt again."
312,1961,"Jul 3 2008 	What a trip!!	Can well recommend this hotel. Staff were fantastic and very helpful. JFK airport managed to loose my luggage even before I'd landed, but i was promised that it would be at my Hotel the next day, and it was! Bar staff are excellent, Tony was a legend! Take a trip in one of the yellow taxi's, they are extremely funny to ride in! Times square is beautiful and Toys r Us, WOW!! This is a must, especially for young couples!Stew"
313,1961,"Jun 29 2008	Worst hotel experience	It was my first time in New York and for me the hotel makes half of experience. The problem was it ruined it after we noticed things were going missing from our hotel room. The following things were STOLEN:GHD STRAIGHTERSONY CAMERATOMMY HILFIGER CARDIGANPHONE CHARGERMAC MAKE-UPPLUS....MY NEW UGG BOOTS WERE SLASHED?????I travel all over the world as part of my job but i've NEVER had anything like this ever happen before. Plus, when we told the hotel these items were all missing they said they were 'investing' it. But they never got back to us and we had to chase them to find out they questioned their staff and they didn't find anything. That's the most ridiciolus thing...no one is going to say 'I STOLE THEM'. It's just upsetting that no one apologized, no compensation was given...basicall the hotel DIDN'T CARE!DON'T STAY HERE - THEY'RE ARE THIEFS WORKING THERE!!!!"
314,1961,"Jun 28 2008 	Busy central and exciting	I stayed with my family for a few days before heading west. Although there was a small problem with payment when the card paying displayed an error and the bank was not contacted properly when we got to our room it was very acceptable. Only problem was that the family room was two doubles but that seems pretty much standard in the States and wasn't a huge problem. Ice machine and vending machines in the corridors were a cheaper alternative to mini bar. The hotel lobby is phenomenal and there was plenty space to wait about - also a variety of shops, coffee and a couple pay phones which meant that we could avoid paying extortionate moblie charges from our foreign phones. The breakfast buffet was insane and the omelette and waffle chefs were entertaining. All of the staff were friendly and the waiters all took the time to chat. Breakfast was expensive and we hadn't got the deal that included it so the other days we went to a cheap caf round the corner. Great location and a really exciting, busy NY hotel. There was a desk that could organise trips and a really friendly guy fixed us up with our tour tickets and recommended the best deals, prices and trips. When we left the doormen easily secured us one of their cars and the driver was once again of a high standard."
315,1961,"Jun 23 2008	Great Location	Great location, 5 minutes walk from Grand Central. Lots of places nearby to eat breakfast with the locals. Tried the Starbucks in the hotel on the last morning and were really disappointed with the service and standard of drink and food, so we would recommend eating out. If you like to walk this hotel is perfect as you are in easy walking distance of many of the city's attractions - 5th Avenue, Times Square, New York Public Library and Central Park. The standard of our room was good - there were two large queen sized beds. Service ok- very impressive lobby. Would stay there again."
316,1961,"Jun 22 2008 	Lovely hotel	This is a lovely hotel to stay in for a quick trip into New York. It is situated very close to Grand Central Station and is moments away from 5th Avenue (superb for shopping) and a few blocks from Times Square. Ok, the rooms are quite small but you won't be spending all day in them. They have ensuite facilities which are adequate. The rooms are clean and tidy and the staff are more than friendly. I really enjoyed my stay there for the week and would definately go back."
317,1961,"Jun 18 2008 	Very OK	Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.Good location, Beautiful Lobby, rooms older, some maintenance needed in bathrooms, halls, carpeting etc., check in quick, First room toilet would not flush properly..called maintenance.After plunging still no luck ...so requested a room change..got it right away to a room where the toilet flushes twice every time.House cleaning know about the plumbing but little is done..its left for you the guest to DISCOVER. Make sure your plumbing works when arriving at room.DO NOT GET ADJOINING ROOMS..the noise from next door will keep you up.. slamming of doors ..and Im not kidding!Be prepared to tip 5-10 dollars for storing and getting your luggage back each time...attendants always pull out a wad of bills just to remind you...these individuals are a real class act! Try the Affinia Manhatten for a better stay...thats why its rated by trip advisor ...and all of you at a much higher level."
318,1961,"Jun 18 2008 	Nice hotel - convenient location	Stayed here with my husband and 2 children weekend of 6/13/08.Nice hotel, beautiful lobby, and the check in was quick. The hotel is in a great location with 5th avenue about 2 blocks away. Our room was not the room you see on line. It was obviously an older room with some wear and tear and pretty small. The tub had some nice size porcelain chips out of the bottom and the shower curtain rod was rusted. But the beds were comfy and it was definetely a clean room. Rooms were also quite and we could not hear the people on either side of us.Another note is when we got to our room, the room next to us had ordered room service and they set their remaining food out for pick up. It stayed there until the following morning, whenever house cleaning came, because it was there when we left in the morning to head out for the day but gone when we got back around 7pm, but that may be normal, I don't know, I've never come across that before.At one point both of our room keys had stopped working, but a quick run back down to the front desk and that was remedied.Valet parking was also a plus in our book.We would definetely stay here again. It is a nice hotel for the $."
319,1961,Jun 12 2008 	Character hotel	Great location with character. Very small rooms but that is to be expected in NY. We didn't care. We chose this hotel because of it's character. Concierge was very helpful. Hotel was very busy as it was the weekend of New York marathon! We did not know this until we arrived! Excellent hotel choice.
320,1961,"Jun 12 2008 	Had a good stay	Had a hard time finding an affordable hotel in Manhattan. Came across this hotel at hotels.com and decided to book it. The location was excellent and I can take a coach bus from the airport to Grand Central Terminal and walk to the hotel. From the Grand Central Terminal, you can easily reach different part of New York City.The room had a LCD TV and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is a bit worn out but clean. There is also no fridge in the room. Was given a room facing the air-con generator which can be a bit noisy. Try to ask for a room at a higher floor or one that faces the road.Do consider this hotel if you need one at a convenient location."
321,1961,"Jun 11 2008 	Lovely Old Hotel	We stayed one night at the Roosevelt in March. The room was quite large by NYC standards. The bed was great, very comfortable. The wallpaper/paint looked a bit old, but somehow, it worked in this historic older hotel - didn't bother me as it might if it was just a modern hotel with old wallpaper/paint.The doormen were just wonderful - posed for pictures with my daughter. There were cars waiting to pull in and my husband was trying to load luggage quickly, my daughter asked for her doll, he began to tell her no there were cars waiting, the bellman said &quot;oh, Dad, get her doll, it will only take a minute&quot;. He won our hearts with that.We booked a package that included a breakfast buffet - I highly reccommend it - the buffet was fabulous! The lobby area is beautiful, great for taking photos."
322,1961,"Jun 11 2008 	Rudest hotel staff I ever met	The location of this hotel is absolutely brilliant if you want to explore New York City - but the standard of the staff's competency and friendliness left a lot to be desired.They made a mistake checking me in and rang me at 11.45pm on my second night, demanding I come down to the reception to help them sort it out - the manager's apology alone didn't replace my good night's sleep which I needed for work the next day.My customers were told I had not checked in yet when they rang to speak with me, even though I had already checked in 3 days before, and after I had checked out the staff refused to let me put my suitcase into the storage room - until I offered a generous tip. Even then, the porter just glared at me for inconveniencing him.For breakfast, you have to cough up a whopping 30 bucks, even if you only want a cup of tea! My room card kept getting disconnected, so I kepot having to go up and down in the elevator to have it replaced.On top of it, they &quot;lost&quot; my colleague's reservation, and only a ten dollar tip made it &quot;reappear&quot;! By the way, the rooms were dark and depressing, and if you want to chance it ask for a room on a high level because of the noise."
323,1961,Jun 10 2008 	Terrible experience not recommended	I stayed in this hotel on business for 5 nights. I had to move rooms twice the first time because of the traffic noise and the second time because of a problem with the water pipes in the room. The people on the reception desk had terrible customer service and always made it seem like it was my fault that I was having issues. I very rarely complain at hotels but in this case I was unable to sleep for the first 3 nights. I didn't have my towels replaced by the chamber maid as I would have expected for this class of hotel. I also found that the porters would only acknowledge you if you were pulling up to the hotel in a limo it was trying to be an upper class hotel but was miserably failing. If you are considering staying here please look elsewhere!!
324,1961,"Jun 10 2008 	Wonderful Bed!!	We got a room at this wonderful hotel for $150 CAN through priceline. com The lobby was stunning and very close to the Grand Station and Times Square (tip: the seafood restaurant at the Grand station is excellent and cheap too) And after a whole day of walking all over manhattan the bed felt heavenly. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. ( decent size, but remember this IS Manhattan so having said that the room was huge) The staff at the lobby was very friendly and we were given a two queen size bed room when when requested it.One thing though, there was no coffe maker on the rooms and the one served on the lobby ( Starbucks) was a little pricier that the ones that you can find at the street.Still it was a memorably experience and comparing to the other hotels availabe in manahattan this was a nice changep.s.&quot;Maid in manhattan&quot; was filmed in this Hotel!!!"
325,1961,"Jun 10 2008 	Lovely Hotel	My partner and I stayed at the Roosevelt for 3 nights during May. On checking in we were immediately upgraded to a larger room (thanks!). The hotel staff were very polite and courteous. The lobby was impressive, with a beautiful display of fresh flowers. The hotel bar was right off the lobby so you could chill and people watch after a busy day shopping and sight seeing. The room was clean and comfortable and the bed was HUGE!!!The hotel is right next to Grand Central Terminal so is handy for subway. There are plenty of places to eat near hotel and times square is only a few blocks away.I would definately recommend this hotel, and would love to stay here again real soon!"
326,1961,"Jun 9 2008 	Fantastic Location Great Service	Our first port of call on our America trip.We arrived here for a three night stay and they were happy to check us in early, with no additional charge. We were amazed how close it was to everything, Times Square was an easy walk away and Grand Central Station could be seen from the hotel doorstep.We ate in the resteraunt one evening and on the night before we left to continue our travels we had room service. Both meals were fantastic and the service was excellent.I have recommended this to friends and was shocked to see that when I wrote this review it was only #119 in New York!"
327,1961,"Jun 7 2008 	Convenient location	Stayed for a couple of nights for a business trip: Hotel is conveniently located and better refurbished than most.; not a great choice for business travellers though as there was no phone on the desk! Had to call the front desk to get one set up, which they did, but still, the whole thing was annoying. My room was on a lower floor (7th or 8th) and had zero view and very poor light, but that is common in NYC."
328,1961,"Jun 6 2008 	One-Nighter	While we only stayed a night - it was great! We arrived at the hotel in the morning (10am) and we were planning on storing our luggage with the hotel so we could explore NYC, but the guy at the front desk was able to get us in a room right away. It was very comfy and clean. We had planned on staying at another more budget friendly hotel, but I found a great deal on hotels.com and saved a ton.Overall a great experience."
329,1961,"Jun 1 2008 	Great Location	I chose this hotel for a 4-night stay because it was the best rate I could find ($200 Canadian for a superior room on hotels.ca). The hotel has a fancy looking lobby, and our superior room was fine, about the size of a normal hotel room, with a flat-screen TV. The room looked fine and our only complaint was a rather soft and slightly uncomfortable bed.  Everyone seemed friendly and they gave us our room early (9:30 am). The location is great ... close to Grand Central Station and a short walk to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. There are some great breakfast places if you walk west on 45th. Try Top of the Rock (Rockefeller) instead of the Empire State Building --- a great view without any waiting in line!"
330,1961,"May 30 2008	Great hotel for the price	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel for our first trip to NYC. I found a great rate for this hotel for the Memorial Day weekend and I was very pleased with the quality for the amount I paid. We were given an upgrade to a king room instead of the original room I had booked. In the beginning I was a little bummed because our room was on the 3rd floor with only a view of the mechanical equipment of the hotel. However, I think this proved to be very helpful as we were not in our room hardly at all and this definitely kept the street noise out. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was small but still did the job. Plus the Bath &amp; Body Works toiletries were a nice touch. The hotel could use just a little TLC with some of the carpet pulling away from the wall near the air conditioner. We were very happy with the hotel for the price we paid...however, if we had paid much more money I would probably be disappointed. The concierge was very helpful when needed and we never had any problems with housekeeping or the front desk. We loved the Roosevelt and it's location. It was so close to Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, and Times Square. We had a very easy time getting anywhere we needed to be in a small amount of time. As first timers to the city this was definitely a great find for the price!"
331,1961,"May 28 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	We got a bargain rate of $167 from [--] for a one-night stay over Memorial Day weekend. I was not expecting a lot but was pleasantly surprised and favorably impressed. We were upgraded to a deluxe, corner room which had lots of space but was somewhat under-furnished. We found the service to be better and more responsive than at many other NYC hotels where we've stayed. The bathroom is small and could use updating but this was a very comfortable stay and we would return if the price is right."
332,1961,"May 28 2008 	good location	The hotel is very well located in the midtown, between the rockfeller center, the empire state building and time sqaure.Good looking hall and rooms.The room was quite big and clean.Employees were kind and friendly."
333,1961,"May 26 2008 	Great Hotel great location	We stayed in this hotel for a week in may, booked a 24 hour sale rate through Expedia, and i have to say that i was very pleased with the stay. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom has been modernized and the room, towels and sheets were always very clean. The conciege and reception desk staff were very helpful and did their job very well. The only negative was the room size, which was small but enough...after all you wont spend your whole vacation inside the room. The other couple who was travelling with my husband and i actually got a big room with a bathtub (paid the same we did), so i guess not all rooms are as small as ours. Bottom-line: great hotel, with great location (close to Times Square and Grand Central Station). Totally worth it!"
334,1961,"May 23 2008 	Excellent midtown location great hotel lots of charm	Stayed at the Roosevelt for a wedding. Function was superb and food and beverage was of a high quality.I had a room with 2 double beds and it was very spacious for new york hotel rooms. We were at the end of the corridor so it was nice and quiet. Great location, a block or so from Grand Central, easy walking to anywhere. Very convenient for shopping and was able to drop off things and head out again as needed.Would stay here again anytime"
335,1961,"May 21 2008	Highly recommended	After alot of research into New York hotels (and particularly Trip Advisor users' comments) I booked the Roosevelt for 7 nights - and was very glad I did* Great great location - next to Grand Central (excellent for public transport both in NYC and to the airports) - not too noisy either.* Very well appointed hotel - impressive lobby, surprisngly comfortable rooms (though I booked a Cozy Queen and got an upgrade to a better room) - although the bathrooms are a little dated but perfectly adequate. Very professional and helpful staff from the check in right thru to the cleaning ladies.No complaints at all and I would not hesitate recommending this hotel to anybody."
336,1961,"May 19 2008 	My Tips for NYC	I had been looking to go back to NY for a while but all the deals for 6 nights were really expensive. After looking around, the Roosevelt seemed to come out at a reasonable price. After sleeping on it over night the rate dropped by about 300 and I book it. I paid 980 for 6 nights in a superior room with direct flights.FORThe hotel is in a good location for getting around.I paid for a room upgrade and I was happy with the size of the room.I had no problems with the lifts at al (Some people said they had)l.AGAINSTThe windows don't keep out much of the road noise and even on the 15th floor I could here the traffic outside.The staff who store your bags before you leave want a tip to leave them and a tip to collect them. I know many people rely on tips, but they were too aggressive with some people!FLIGHTI flew direct from Manchester to Newark with Continental. The plane was comfortable and the entertainment system on the way out was great (You could chose what you want when you want it), it wasn't so good on the way back.TRANSFERSIf you read the guides about getting to NYC from Newark it sounds complicated. In reality you buy a ticket for the NJ Transit train at the airport terminal before getting on any trains. You then jump on the airports train (Mono rail) to the airports station, you then connect to Penn Station and you are there! Its $15 single and takes 40 Min's in total. You can then buy a 7 day Metro card that covers the buses and Subway for $21.TIPSThe view from the ROCK is the best I have seen anywhere.Take the free tour of Grand Central Station and the New York Public library. They are both very good."
337,1961,"May 18 2008 	The Roosevelt is in a great area	My friend and I just returned from 3 nights at the Roosevelt Hotel in NYC. This beautiful old hotel is well-located at the corner of 45th and Madison Avenue. It is steps from Grand Central Station and all of Midtown.We got a room with two double beds. The room was nice, the beds were comfortable. The decor was average for a 3 star hotel, just fine. The bathroom was nice and clean. The size of the room was pretty good for NYC. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful. It is a &quot;grande dame&quot; type of place. There is a very nice bar with leaded glass windows which was lively while we were there. We did not eat in the restaurant but we had room service several times and were pleased with it. They serve Starbucks coffee and it is excellent if you just can't make yourself get dressed and go out to one of the dozens of Starbucks surrounding the neighborhood. All of the staff were very friendly and eager to please. They were helpful in storing bags and getting taxis. The few things I would vote to improve are an update to the decor of the rooms, and they should add a grab bar for the shower (that is just common sense). The concierge we dealt with was new and did not know the basic things anyone should know who has that job (where can we change currency? asked by guests from another country, she did not know to tell them that any bank will do it).This hotel was not cheap. The drinks and the room service were expensive, but we knew that would be true. You are paying for location and convenience here, and the grand lobby."
338,1961,"May 15 2008	Nice lobby - Room are OK - Bathroom is poor	The lobby is impressing, large &amp; luxury. The guy from reception was very pleasant &amp; efficacious. Effectively a guy from the reservation has been rude on the phone. Astonishing for a hotel at 500 dollars a night... The problem of this hotel is certainly the bathroom which are small and very basic. The bed is very comfortable."
339,1961,"May 11 2008 	Beautiful Hotel - Excellent Location	We booked this hotel for our honeymoon. The hotel itself is stunning and the foyer / reception area is huge. The rooms werent what I expected - two double beds - but the rest of the furniture was old and badly in need of updating. It was basic and didnt have the luxurious qualities of the rest of the hotel. The bathroom was adequate but again nothing fancy or special.Overall I found the hotel very comfortable and the location was excellent, only two blocks across from Times Square. The cost for five nights ended up being the same as the total of the rest of our holiday including all our flights so regarding value for money I'm not sure - I think there was better to be had.I would stay there again and I would recommend it but I'd wait for a special offer first."
340,1961,"May 9 2008	small roomsgreat lobby and locationterrible service	The location great,be prepared for small accomodations, lobby is beautiful too bad service is horrible!! everyone expects tips!!Bar in lobby that serves coffee in am costs don't think its on the house!!on top of that the staff is rude!!Room is comfortable so are the beds. Make sure to request a view other than the rear building and the heating/air condition units!! This was nothing to wake up to in the morning!! One other thing is that when we called to request missing items camera,ipod we were so rudely assisted...never did get a call back from the manager that I asked to please call me...make sure you check your items and lock safe at all times!!!!Nice hotel for the price and location but would think twice before going back"
341,1961,"May 5 2008 	Fantastic location!	Having read lots of review about hotels in New York, I wanted to book something that was fairly central that didn't cost the earth and was clean with our own bathroom. So we booked the Roosevelt and I was really pleased with the hotel during our stay.  It was clean &amp; comfortable, a fantastic location and the temperature was fine (a lot had been written to suggest otherwise!) even though it was hot &amp; sunny outdoors. There is air con in the room so you can control the temperature yourself if its not to your liking anyway. We walked everywhere from here, Times Square, Macy's, the theatre but if you're heading further afield, Grand Central is directly across the road, also the subway to take you downtown.We stayed in a twin room which was exactly as was described on the website, there was plenty room for us and all our shopping! The only gripe would be that there is no extractor fan in the bathroom so it gets a little steamy but other than that, I was delighted with the place. Oh and the concierge was a little unhelful - tried to make us pay above the price for our theatre tickets telling us the performance was sold out. Went directly to the theatre on the day (sat) expecting to be told the same, but we were given a choice of seats and actually got orchestra seats for the price below (about $100 less!) Got a fantastic deal for a good hotel in a great location - what more do you want? Would definately stay again &amp; recommend."
342,1961,Apr 30 2008 	Great location	We stayed at the Roosevelt for 5 nights. This was my first trip to New York and found it difficult to choose a hotel as there are so many! However I was not disappointed with my choice. The location of the Hotel is perfect for all the main mid-town attractions and right next to Grand Central if you want to hop on the underground to go further down or up town. The lobby and bar area are beautiful and comfortable with a nice lively buzz about them. I found the staff to be polite and helpful at all times. We booked a superior room - it was pretty basic and quite small but very clean and the bed was really comfortable. The only problem we had was that our room was inter-connecting and our neighbours were really early risers and really loud! So not much privacy if on a romantic getaway! However I would happily stay there again and recommend the Hotel to others.
343,1961,"Apr 30 2008	Immensely Disappointed in The Roosevelt Hotel	While The Roosevelt Hotel's website boasts beautiful pictures and gives one the impression of hospitality and comfort, our actual stay at the hotel tells another story.Upon check-in, we discovered dried urine on the toilet seat. We contacted the front desk about this disgusting problem, who in turned blamed housekeeping and did not seem to care to do much to address our concerns. During the next two days, we continuously contacted several managers, who shifted the responsibility of dealing with our concern to other managers. We were promised calls back to address the problem, and were disappointed, but albeit not shocked at this point, that no one returned our calls.Additionally, the bath did not run hot water. After approximately 20-25 minutes of having the water temperature in the tub set on the maximum heat level, we were able to have some lukewarm water. The Roosevelt's solution to this problem? Sending a technician to our room well after our showers were over.If a dirty toilet and cold water in the shower weren't enough, the television only had a handful of channels that showed a clear picture, while the remaining channels were scrambled.In conclusion, don't be fooled by the hotel's website, and opt to stay elsewhere."
344,1961,"Apr 28 2008	Loved the Roosevelt	This hotel was great. Check in is not until 3 but of course they were nice enough to check our luggage so we could walk around and tour the city. The hotel is within walking distance of Times Square and 5th Ave, along with many other great sights. Also, once we did come back to check in they had a larger room with 2 beds and upgraded us for FREE!! Unbelievable service!! I was not expecting this!! I would definately stay here again if I were to go back to NYC!!"
345,1961,"Apr 28 2008 	Excellent and Im fussy!	I stayed in the Roosevelt for five days between 8th Feb - 12th Feb and had an excellent stay. The room was lovely and clean and tidied each day. The weather in New York was so cold and coming back after a long day shopping or sight seeing into a lovelty warm lobby and hotel was a pleasure. The staff were friendly and the hotel had a great ambience about it. It was in a great location as well, two mins walk from grand central station. The gym was also open 24 hrs and was supplied with fresh fruit at all times. I'm normally a very fussy customer, but I can honestly say this hotel was excellent and I'll be back!"
346,1961,"Apr 24 2008 	Loved the Roosevelt! Great Location!!	My husband and I stayed at the Roosevelt 4/17-4/23. We loved it. I had emailed ahead of time requesting a room with a view since it was our first anniversary. We had booked a cozy queen on hotels.com for a rate of $162 a night. When we arrived we got upgraded to a king room with a view of the street. Lisa at the check in counter was great. Great location. Walking distance to Grand Central Station, Rockefeller center, and Times Square. We even walked to the empire state building which was about 10 blocks away. When we come back as long as we can get a good rate we will stay here again. The bathroom was smaller.. the only downside to this hotel was that they didnt have a whole lot of electrical outlets by mirrors. While my husband was in the shower I was trying to blow dry my hair and flat iron it and it was kind of hard to do without a mirror."
347,1961,"Apr 22 2008 	Very Poor Staff	We booked the Roosevelt on E45th Street because it was central and looked to have an old world charm. Central it was, charming it most definitely wasn't.On arriving at the hotel after travelling from London we were told our room was double booked and we would be put in a temporary room overnight and reassigned the rome we booked (with an upgrade)the following day. We were then told we should vacate our temporary room before midday the following day, but could not be allocated the 'upgraded' room until after 3pm. When we queried what we should do with our luggage, we were told a bell hop would collect our bags from the temporary room and deliver them to the new room. Whilst this was inconvenient we appeared to have no option. On returning to the hotel after 3pm we had to go through the whole check in process again, with somebody who seemed to find us an annoying interruption to his day, and were allocated the room we had originally paid for (no upgrade). When our bags were redelivered to our room, the bell hop actually argued that our tip was insufficient and tried to intimidate my friend into paying more. When we pointed out that the reason he even had our luggage was because the hotel had messed up, he stated it wasn't his problem. Even knocking on the door after we closed it to query the amount again.Whilst appreciating that tipping is a recognised activity in NY, I have never encountered so many staff who seemed intent on fleecing us for as much money as possible. The front desk staff were nothing short of rude. The only exception were the housekeeping staff who not only ensured the rooms were clean and tidy, but greeted us with a friendly good morning each day.On a practical note, the lifts did not appear to cater for the number of guests. We were two of many who caught the lift going up in order to come down, as it was virtually impossible to get a down lift from the 7th floor.Having visited NY prior to this trip and experienced the friendliness of other hotel staff, I would strongly urge travellers to stay away from the Roosevelt."
1,1964,Fantastic Experience	First visit...3 nights. Great area over the terrific HighLine. State of the art design...Standard Grill excellent....you could also tell good value by the people waiting after 11.00pm.Room views fantastic.The 18th Floor Lounge is awesone...and lifts must be unique.Staff are good and all in all a great &quot;different&quot; hotel experience.
2,1964,"Best Hotel in Chelsea!!!	Excellent service---always willing to help with anything.Room was awesome---great views of Chelsea/Hudson River/Highline. Peekaboo showers opened up room. Room with King bed nice and spacious for 2 people. Loved the floor-to-ceiling windows!!! Hubby loved the huge TV mounted on the wall.Location---great esp. since Chelsea is our favorite area. Easy to find your way around.Only negative comment is I wish there was a small microwave/fridge/coffee pot. We survived without them, no big deal."
3,1964,"Nov 26 2009 	A Mixed Bag	We have just returned from 4 nights in The Standard Hotel in the Meatpacking district of New York City and found this hotel to be a very mixed bag. On the positive side, meatpacking is a vibrant lively area with great restaurants and up-market shopping and The Standard is located right in the heart of this. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, rooms are a little small but typical of NYC, but there are great views across the city. We had a room on the 11th floor and from our bath we could look out across the city, taking advantage of the floor to ceiling window.The bistro and the grill were both pretty good, standard American dining but definitely worth trying. Now for the major thing to be warned about...the picturesque lounge bar on the 18th floor closes to residents at 9pm and becomes a nightclub! That means that because it is located on the top floor, the sound travels right the way down through the whole building...on the night we arrived we were woked by throbbing bass at 2am, luckily we had ear-plugs that we could use. The funny thing about the lounge/club on the top floor after 9pm is that as a guest you are not allowed to go in! So you have to put up with the noise but can't join in, it is a little silly but i am sure they are making a large amount of money by hiring the space out. If you want a drink in the bistro after 11 also be warned it is extremely busy and you may struggle to be served. We did use room service and that was good, food arrived quickly and was exactly as ordered. Staff were also friendly and helpful, so no complaints there."
4,1964,"Nov 25 2009 	Will stay here again and again!!	We stayed here for 4 nights in October and the hotel is fabulous. Our room had dual views over the Hudson and The Empire State Building. The room was gorgeous, very stylish, with a very cool layout including a bathroom divided from the main bedroom by only a glass screen. The bars, cafe and restaurant downstairs just add to the vibe. Look out also for the really cool video display in the lifts! The Meat Packing area itself is so much fun with lots going on in the evenings and real gritty character during the day. Greenwich Village is also an easy walk. Whatever you do eat at Budakan restaurant just a couple of minutes from the hotel, and its also worth visiting the very moving World Trade Centre Museum nearby, and if you have time the Chelsea Market Food Tour. Loved it here and we will be back!"
5,1964,"Nov 25 2009 	Great view unacceptable service.	I stayed for a week at the standard at the beginning of November 09. And at the end, they lost one of my bags in the luggage room. I have been back for 3 weeks now, and except for one email telling me who would be my contact, no news whatsoever about my lost luggage. For a hotel in that category, and for 500$ a night, this is unacceptable. I have sent 2 emails that remain unanswered. So basically my conclusion is : overpriced and don't give a damn about customers..."
6,1964,"Nov 24 2009 	Loved The Standard!	Great location, great room, great service, great elevators and fast, great bed, great TV, great peace and quite.The shower took a bit getting used to...lolI've stayed all over NYC and I must admit that The Standard is the best so far. Very chic, not stuffy...their Grille is open until 4PM!!!!The Boom Boom room is a total scene...I don't know why people are writing bad reviews...they should have stayed at The Waldorf."
7,1964,"Nov 23 2009 	Amazing hotel great place to stay	What was everyone smoking that they gave this place bad reviews? One person in a previous review seriously complained that he had to transfer the bar of soap between the room and the shower. Well, uh, last time I checked they give you a generous serving of shower gel in addition to the bar of soap.The room is very functional, I don't get why people complained about that either. The bed is SUPER SUPER comfortable. The TV is HUGE and easy to figure out. Gets lots of HD channels. The view is spectacular. The location amazing. The service top-notch. The shower with it's see-through wall is a bit strange but you get used to it. The shower is comfortable and I didn't want to leave once I was in it.The elevator is fune with its neat video art as you ride it. It was DEAD quiet at night. Didn't hear a thing other than hallway noise now and then. No street noise, no noise from other rooms. It is conveniently located, we subwayed, walked or cabbed everywhere in Manhattan with no problems.The only warning I would give is everyone here is fashionable. I don't mean they wear a suit and tie, that is the easy way to look good. I mean fashionable. As in a genuine sense of fashion and style. I thought I was good to go..boy was I wrong. For breakfast a walk to Gray Dog is worth it, and for Italian try Gradisca.So yeah, fantastic hotel, don't listen to the negative reviews. The room size was gigantic, in my opinion. I was expecting a closet and got a palace."
8,1964,Nov 23 2009 	loved this place	it looked fantastic and was fantastic. the staff were all helpful - securing dinner reservations (although we didn't love the restaurant bobo) and printing maps. the beer garden - on a beautiful fall afternoon - was a blast and the restaurant was excellent as well. the views are incredible and we didn't even have the top-of-the-line room.
9,1964,"Nov 21 2009 	If you just care for a nice view...	I am currently staying at The Standard as I write this review. I was really looking forward to staying here so I didn't have any doubts when we decided to come to New York for our 7-night honeymoon, impressed by the design proposal and the massive views of The Standard Suite (room 8.23).When we booked the room, I made it clear we wanted to pay cash for our room, which it didn't seem to be a problem when I contacted the hotel. However, our problems with the service started at the check in: the person who received us was not prepared for this method of payment, uncomfortable and almost annoyed, insisting in authorizing the full amount of our stay in our credit card. We offered the cash deposit of all the money which was, to my surprise, not accepted. He really wanted the credit card... after a few times trying to authorize it (we told him again and again that we didn't have high limits available on our credit card, hey, we had just payed for our wedding!), he finally took the cash. Took too long, and it was embarrassing as there was a long line forming after us.We got sick on the first days and we had to ask for some salt, a request received with irony by the room service staff and ignored. Had to call again to finally get the salt... absurd.Then we ran out of shower gel. How come house keeping does not check something basic as replacing your shower gel? Had to call for more, took forever, and when I was just about to do my second call, waiting wrapped in a towel, it arrived. The concierge service was fine, doing reservations and giving you recommendations in the neighborhood but, as the text messages they supposedly were sending to us were not arriving to our room phone, in the end, our impression was very poor.And, speaking of phones, ours doesn't work for local calls (they are supposed to be free but we're using our cell phones - from spain - instead). Whenever we try to call, we get a &quot;please hang up&quot; message as if the phone was blocked. I didn't even bother calling to have it unblocked/fixed. I would probably have to call twice, get upset, etc. so I left it the way it is as I really don't feel like interacting with the staff.The good side? the room has impressive views and nice designed furniture. Bathtub by Philip Starck, all very nice indeed, specially if you're design oriented and really cares about this stuff, as we do. But a good hotel, those who stay on for long, is not only made by good views and design. It needs to excel in service. The next &quot;hip-place-to-be&quot; hotel is just around the corner and If I want to survive in the New York city battlefield, I would improve that aspect of my business.Def not staying again. Not worth the 600USD/night rate."
10,1964,"Nov 17 2009 	A hip hotel run by teenagers	Very trendy hotel in a great location that attracts a trendy crowd. The 18thfl bar is large and has beautiful views, but you can't get in after 7:30pm or so unless you have the secret password. As a hotel guest, either go early like we did, or go to the first fl bar. Rooms are tiny with no place to put your suitcase(s). The staff were young and disorganized with check-in, following up on requests. The elevator broke down at one point. I kept wanting to see if there was an experienced adult as the mgr, but didn't find it. I recommend it just because of its uniqueness (location on High Line, glitterati bar, location in Meat Packing District. But I wouldn't make it my regular hotel when going to NYC."
11,1964,Nov 11 2009 	NYC wrapped in a single hotel!	Overall i really enjoyed my stay at the Standard. I have stayed at the Standard in LA and other hotels in NYC and am extremely impreseed with the hotels aesthetics and feel. It simplifies big city wrapped up in its giant structure. I loved the tight room and amazing bathroom features. The hotel is a little pricey but you know the quality that comes with that. Great amenities downstairs with a packed bar scene.
12,1964,"Nov 9 2009 	Over-priced / poor service	I made the mistake of traveling to NYC in late September when the U.N. was in session - difficult at best to get a hotel room, and 'The Standard' took full advantage, charging (gouging, really) $500 for a night in a shoebox. Despite a guaranteed reservation and a 3:00 PM arrival, I was made to wait another hour in the bar before I could get into my room (the didnt even comp me the beer). The room could generously be described as 'austere' (or less generously as cold - for that kind of money, I'll take classic luxury, thanks). The internet service was poor, and printing ridiculously cumbersome (no business center to speak of - you print via a website to reception's small printer). Worst of all, I was roused from my bed at 8:00 AM next morning by hammering and saws - they were installing flooring in the room directly above me. When I checked out shortly thereafter, I spoke to the manager, who declined to even take anything off my bill. Very short term thinking on their part; I wonder where they'll be when the hype wears off?"
13,1964,"Nov 8 2009 	Great location - terrible hotel	Just stayed overnight in this hotel - what a poor experience! First, you cannot even find an entrance from the street. The lobby is small, and the elevator is dark. The room is a joke - it's tiny with so-called &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; shower - basically a shower stall next to the entrance door. The water in the shower would not stop running. There is only one soap bar in the bathroom so you need to transfer it back and forth between the bathroom and the shower. I completely agree with previous reviewes - there should be a line between function and design, and this hotel just did not get it. The bed was very low - almost on the floor ( not sure what is so trendy about it - just plain uncomfortabe). The plastic table in the room was all scratched. The closet space is enough for 1 overnight bag - nothing else would fit. Our room was a deluxe one - I cannot even imagine what a standard room looks like. The checkout is at 12 noon but after we came back from a breakfast at 11:15 AM, the key to the room was deactivated according to the hotel &quot;policy&quot; , and we had to make 2 trips up and down because the key was still not working, and the reception person could not find anything wrong with it. Buttom line - doesn't nearly worth $600 per night - I would not go back even for $199 promotion. Don't waste your money. We stayed in gansevoort during our last trips and will be going there again."
14,1964,"Nov 8 2009 	Never again	I have just returned from my second stay at the Standard and I will not be going backFor a British businessman in New York fast reliable internet connection is essential but as on my first visit, the IT at the Standard is at best erratic: yet again I had to get help from the in-house technician who was pleasant but only able to re-connect me after at least an hour of trying. He told me that all iPhones have to be individually connected...I didn't have time to test this but I had no internet service from my phone during my stayThe rooms are small [Queen room is much smaller than Queen corner though this is explained on the website] Very little clothes storage for one person, let alone twoThe shower floor does not drain so old soap suds float about all night unless attacked with all the towelsthe rooms are not 100% soundproofThe light switches are badly sited, the power points ditto and these are scarceI did not try the restaurant for dinner as it seems always to be full, it served a good breakfast thoughThe staff are not friendly, not helpful and appear deeply un -nterested in their 'guests'"
15,1964,"Nov 3 2009 	great location pooooooooooooooor service	Great place to stay if you want something hip but service is very very poor. We stayed in a corner room but the room was the size of an average shoebox. The bathroom was home depot deluxe, without bath and there wasn't really a bed, more a mattress on the ground. The service was pretty poor, room service plates which weren't picked for over 24 hours in the hallway and the annoying video animation in the elevator drives you nuts after 3 days. The location is great, the beergarten is a killer but the restaurant is o so bad. We ordered soft boiled eggs for breakfast but we had to sent them back 3 times because they forgot to boile them. The waitress said the kitchen had difficulty boiling eggs so advised us to order something else (no joke). There was a party going on in the hotel on halloween night untill 3am orso which is great if you want to have a rave in your room but a bit annoying if you want to get some sleep. For a normal hotel experience for the same price, book the Plaza or the Peninsula, if you want to be hip amongst the tourist, the Standard is the place to be!"
16,1964,"Oct 31 2009 	A fun friendly place to stay.	My wife and I were wrapping up a 2 week vacation by spending a weekend in New York. I decided to try out this hotel. Are we glad we did! Very friendly service; from the bellhop to the checkin staff to the room service staff; everyone was very nice, and everyone had advice about things to do in the neighborhood (which borders both Chelsea and the West Village). The hotel is very modern and very trendy, which may not be to everyone's taste. The room was great; a view of the Empire State Bldg. and surroundings. The peekaboo shower was certainly an interesting experience. Considering that rooms in New York are notoriously small, the rooms here are surprisingly spacious. In short; we loved this hotel, and would absolutely stay here again when we return to NYC."
17,1964,"Oct 28 2009 	Amazing end to our NYC trip....superb hotel.	We decided on splitting our NYC trip into 2...the first, we stayed Midtown, in a somewhat disappointing The MAve. And we were oh so pleased to have made The Standard in Meatpacking our last. We spent 3 nights in this UBER trendy hotel to finish off our fab NYC visit.The area: wow....I must start by saying that the Meatpacking District is so very cool, and has a trendy, underground feel to it. It may not be THE in-area right now (Hell's Kitchen is hotting up big time), but it is still the Meatpacking district, point. Nice shops, great restaurants (we frequented Pastis more than once), the High Line park is lovely and gives a great chance to explore the area. We really enjoyed exploring on foot and walked all the way down Bleecker Street until we hit Soho for great shopping and scene. We even went so far as to walk all the way from Brooklyn Bridge up through Tribeca then Soho and up to The Standard hotel. Walk, walk, walk....staying at this hotel puts you in a great position to explore by foot.The hotel staff: All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I have read other reviews saying that they felt the staff would barely look up and offer assistance. I personally think though that some people confuse the hotel service you would expect to find in a 5 star chain to the service one simply must expect at a trendy, boutique-esque hotel. All staff were amazing. We had room service, bellboy bags to room, assistance at the front desk on a few occasions...each and every time, without fail, we were given friendly, cool service with a smile...not fake, not over the top...just what one would expect. No robots here...just staff with personality. The hotel: ooh la la...from it's truly unique exterior to it's super trendy interior, The Standard really knows how to put on a show. The design is supercool. The bright yellow table/bench combos adorn the entrance, leading to revolving doors, bringing you into a slick, sexy lobby. Round the corner are the pitch black elevators...quit complaining that they are too dark people! It's all about design. So you know...the elevators are pitch black, you are in darkness, apart from 2 adjacent video screens with a superb, ongoing digital video collage...I seriously loved the ride up and down to our 14th floor. The screens DO provide some light, so it's not like you are fumbling around in the dark. We arrive on the 14th floor, heading down the minimal corridor to room 1414. The numbers are embossed in HUGE, vertically, on the door itself, as well as on small plates next to the door (I wonder if they had to add those because the complainers couldn't 'see' the numbers on the doors originally). We enter the room and need a moment to compose ourselves because the view just takes our breath away. We see ALL of downtown, the Hudson River, Jersey City, Madame Liberty in the distance, High Line park below. The floor to ceiling, room wide, windows are just superb. And yes...people can see into the rooms so beware, unless you like to put on a show for those down below. The room itself is also quite simply amazing. We took a Deluxe King...perfect choice, room enough to swing quite a few cats, very clever use of space and design. The bed was very, very comfortable, with the loveliest squishiest pillows I have slept on in a long time. The bath was more than big enough for the 2 of us...and if you are into that kinda thing, 3 is still not a crowd in that tub. The closet space is more than plenty for a typical weekend away in New York...we solved the suitcase 'space' issue by putting our cases in the corner of the room on a table, voila...nothing worth complaining about. The toiletries are provided by Kiss My Face...hide them daily so you keep getting more to take back home, they are lovely!The ONLY 1 downside to our room was that on Saturday night, we actually wanted an early night, but there is a bar down the road which does have an outside area belting music till the early hours. Brass Monkey I think it is called. The sound is muffled, the room insulation is very good, but still, I did use earplugs to drown out the slight noise. The issue is solved very easily...just use earplugs, or go down and join the party. This would not put me off staying at the Standard again.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. It's all about design, cool, great atmosphere, catering to couples/singles...not families (I secretly like that fact). I will most certainly, 100% be coming back for a stay when next in New York."
18,1964,"Oct 28 2009 	Yeah great but.....	Cool and trendy hotel. Very fashion and all but......the lobby was too noisy and busy in the evenings with people waiting for the restaurant. Hard to find your floor in the elevator as it is hardly illuminated for you to enjoy the videos shown on the walls. Peek-a-boo shower and beds: UNBELIEVABLE, but too expensive.....................it is great but too expensive"
19,1964,"Oct 26 2009 	Awesome Anniversary	My wife and I had a fantastic time at the Standard and will be back again for more fun. The staff at the Standard was very attentive and helpful from the time we arrived until our departure. We had lots of NYC plans including a U2 concert and the hotel made a great base camp. A post concert dinner at the Standard Grill was an excellent way to cap off our evening. Come to think of it, we ate breakfast, lunch and dinner there and have to say it was good food for a good value. Don't forget to go to the beer garden before you head out on the town!"
20,1964,"Oct 20 2009 	A great new hotel in NYC	I stayed at The Standard recently on a trip to NYC to visit a friend. I enjoyed my stay throughouly. The design of the hotel is superb - I had an amazing view! However, my room was a little small...but I guess that's you expect in NYC. I really liked the location in Meatpacking District. It's trendy party of town with a lot going on. There are a ton of great restaurants and night spots nearby that the staff is more than happy to differentiate for you and help you find. I will be going back in the future for sure."
21,1964,"Oct 19 2009 	Very Cool	We found a great online only rate for a Standard Queen ($199/night).The hotel is an architectural marvel (essentially built on concrete stilts). The new High Line Park travels underneath and the neighborhood is filled with boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants."
22,1964,"Oct 19 2009 	Trendy New Hotel	This brand new hotel in the Meatpacking District is stylish and trendy. Madonna was there the night before I stayed there, and they have wonderful roomy sofa's."
23,1964,Oct 14 2009 	Don't even think about it!	The new Standard Hotel in NYC was a real disappointment. No doubt the views are outstanding from each room. From mine I could see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The bellmen are very cute and pleasant. HOWEVER....the bed was very lumpy and so uncomfortable; my room was not made up one day during my 3 day stay; the staff at the desk had lots of attitude; it is difficult to see elevator floor numbers on the panel; no suitable lamp for bedtime reading; if you crack a window for some air the street noise is very loud; car wasn't brought around despite my asking for it one hour before I checked out so then I waited another 1/2 hour; waiter at the oh so trendy Grill was rude removing plates during conversation; we couldn't find the entrance door when we first drove up to the hotel!!! My brother and his son are architects and they joined me for an evening meal. I am a designer. We appreciate the avant garde ambience of the hotel for sure......BUT....good form MUST follow function. There is a poor choice of materials (already deeply scratched black plastic tables in each room)(or cream rug on floor already showing stains) frequently and the lighting is intentionally minimal....but ya need to see your floor number in the elevator! I recommend the Gansevoort Hotel one block away. Who needs a view when you can enjoy a good night's sleep on a comfy mattress with a pleaseant staff?
24,1964,"Oct 14 2009 	So Sub Standard we had to leave	Apparently there is no point in requesting a quiet room as it is not possible at the NY Standard, and to add insult to injury there seems to be a quality control problem which also means that it is a total guess as to whether things in your room will actually be working correctly (from one room to another, TV not working, truly scalding water, drapes broken, etc). Then there are issues like dirty carpets, trim falling off in room and overall low quality materials poorly installed, bathrooms designed in such a way that the shower floods the entire floor, ridiculously small closets that cannot hold more then a couple of days of clothes for two and nowhere to keep the then nec. suitcases filled with remaining clothes (and no luggage stand for it either). Aside from the views and superficial attractiveness of the property this hotel is truly lacking, they really missed the fact that form should follow function. You might not even realize what you are compromising on and to what extent unless you move to other lodging as we did, it was night and day to find ourselves in real luxury for the same price elsewhere."
25,1964,"Oct 14 2009 	Sub-Standard.	This hotel looked great on the surface, good location, great views and nice amenities but once you dive deeper you'll find the appeal is only skin deep.A variety of issues meant our stay was cut short, we lost a night's sleep, a day out of our vacation and soon we were force to find a suitable hotel for the rest of our trip during a very booked week.Poor craftsmanship and maintenance meant scalding water came out of the bathtub, hot water out of the shower caused the smoke alarm to activate (with a disheartening lack of response to the alarm or our safety from the front desk) and bathroom design that causes shower water to wet the entire floor making it very slippery.Surprisingly for a newish hotel, the rugs were already filthy with stains, the weatherstripping around the wood wall feature was peeling off in the 3 rooms I was in, tiles were chipped and curtain rods broke... no insulation between rooms means you hear your neighbor moving their drapes. Hope you didn't bring a lot of clothes because there's virtually no closet space and about 3-4 hangers, make sure you get one at least with the four 8&quot;x8&quot; shelves.WC has no storage, no lock and a huge gap in the hinge side... meaning make sure there's toilet paper in there first since housekeeping doesn't replace it, and expect no privacy since the design and construction telegraphs every sound.Speaking of sound, don't stay on the &quot;Superior&quot; side if you want any rest, you'll be right above this gem of a noise maker called the &quot;Brass Monkey&quot; that's open till 4am. Yes that wonderful build quality I told you about before means you'll hear every hoot, holler and bass note that comes out of their outdoor section. You might get lucky with the noise in the &quot;Deluxe&quot; rooms further down on the other wing but don't bet on it, I could hear the racket from a 17th floor &quot;Superior&quot; room. Watch out for rooms near the elevator and ice machine, you'll hear them all night long as well.They have a restaurant and a bar but I never got to try either, we got turned away because it was booked for a private event and filled with overspill respectively. Note to hotel, tell your guests when it's booked so they don't rely on coming back for a bite.The staff tried to help but honestly, they don't have the tools to fix what's fundamentally wrong with this hotel. If you can deal with all of the headaches of this hotel, and there is A LOT OF THEM, about the only redeeming quality is the view."
26,1964,"Oct 9 2009 	not good if you need to get some sleep	It was impossible to get a good night sleep at the standard: early morning hammering and drilling and vacuuming in the hall at 7 am.... Construction work going on past mid night and resumes at 7 in the morning. Constant activity loud conversations by staff in hallway by the room door - at 8 am without any consideration for the guest.Management seem to care less of the clients - of course, NYC law allows construction to begin at 7 am - at the expense of the guest's rest - just unacceptable."
27,1964,"Sep 28 2009 	Setting the standard.......	First impressions are good, the hotel is constructed on massive concrete stilts so it looks quite impressive. The bell boy was quick to get to us and take our bags, and walking in to reception you realise this hotel is brand new... cutting edge design and an uber cool feel to the whole place. The elevator has got to be the best elevator i have ever been in, cannot explain here, just go in it! Got into the room and was impressed again with the design and layout, room size is not massive, however the bath certainly is! A glass wall which seperates the bathroom from the living room enables you to watch the flatscreen whilst soaking....It was dark when we arrived and we were on the 14th so an impressive nightscape of New York and the Empire state building meant it just felt wrong to close the curtains.Go downstairs and there is a very cool bar, full of smiley faces and generally very good atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone visiting NY."
28,1964,"Sep 27 2009 	Ok for the price	Was excited to be staying at this new hotel. The first impression of check in and bellman were good. Arrived at my room, took off my shoes and noticed the carpet was wet. I don't mean slightly damp, but wet. I called down to receiption and was told they were 100%. They offered to bring a fan to help dry it out. I was grossed out by having to walk on wet carpet. I couldn't wear socks as they got soaked. This definately put a damper on my stay.There was no clock in the room, so had to utilize my cell phone to see the time. There were several spots on the carpet which was surpising for a new hotel and especially since I thought they had just steamed the carpets.Room service and food were very good.Bellman throughout the stay were super friendly and helpful. There was construction near my room. The noise wasn't too bad, but definately heard workers early in the morning.Street noise was at a minimum.Location was good and views (especially from the gym) were amazing."
29,1964,"Sep 26 2009 	The best experience I have had in NY	The Standard was recommended to me by a friend before it even opened its front doors. I booked online- and got the most amazing rate. My first impression of the hotel was of the doorman who had a smile and a helping hand. The receptionist was efficient and helpful. And the rooms....were the best I have ever stayed in in the Big Apple- the view was typically New York. At night the hotel rocked with the hippest bar and restaurant in town, with that in mind- there was no disturbance in hte main hotel rooms at all.All in all- the best experience in NY."
30,1964,"Sep 25 2009 	This was the best overall hotel experience I have had in Manhattan hands down.	Hip, classy, totally the place to stay in Manhattan right now. You will be greeted with unpretentious smiles and the best customer service (IMHO) anywhere in North America, right now. (BTW, The bellman are all handsome and have the best uniforms in the city) The food is good and a surprising value, and is delivered to your room in actual food service time - as long as it takes to cook, not an hour after you dial. The elevator must be experienced and the guest rooms are cool, uniquely designed and of course feature floor to ceiling, exhibitionist-friendly windows that are the talk of the High Line visitors. Stay, even for one night and you simply must agree.Loved the most? Everything. The least? Having to check out."
31,1964,"Sep 25 2009 	Standrard is overrated	The only good thing I can say about Standard are the visitors. I met many intersting people during my stay. But most of them were saying the same. The Standard is overrated: The price for assmall room is too high, the service is bad, the aircondiotion too loud and so on. I would recommend everyone to stay at a more etablished hotel like Bowery.(where people are also interesting people, but the service and the rooms are much better)"
32,1964,"Sep 20 2009 	Love-Hate	We loved this hotel at the same time as it made us really mad. The tiny room (over $600 a night with taxes) was uncomfortably small for two people but definitely the best tiny room weve experienced. A huge window overlooking the East River, and a window between the bedroom and the bathroom helped opened the room up. However the queen bed, pushed into a corner, made sleeping uncomfortable for the inside personand ridiculously inconvenient when it came to getting up in the middle of the night. Id be very comfortable here by myself, but for two grow-ups it felt downright sillynot to mention utterly overpriced. That said, the bed was comfortable, the bed linens and towels great, and the lighting well thought-out. The big TV at the foot of the bed, in front of the huge window, seems gigantic in such a pint-sized room.However, design is everywhereevery little bit of this place is designed for visual interest. I especially loved the black tiles in the bathroom and WC. However, turn on the faucet in the bathroom and water cascades out of the sink soaking an unsuspecting handwasher. And try to plug in your computer and you have to either unplug the radio or a lamp, or perch awkwardly on the bed. (I consider the lack of convenient electrical outlets totally unforgiveable in a new, purpose-built hotel.) I also thought the lack of a cordless phone was very lame. To continue, the closet was so tiny that there was barely room for one days worth of clothes next to the thick robes and ironing board. Frankly, hotel developer Andre Balazs should know better by now.The staff was friendly and accommodating, and being in such a creative environment balances, somewhat, the annoyances. My two favorite features were the video collage in the elevators and the knitted cozies slipped over the steel stanchions outside. The location is lots of fun. The meatpacking district seems to be getting better all the time. The elevated Highline Park is a big draw. The area is full of New Yorkers but hip internationals seem to dominate. Are they the only people who can afford The Standard?"
33,1964,"Sep 10 2009 	Very Modern and Good Views	My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at The Standard over the weekend. Loved the modern decor and design of both the building itself and the rooms. Rooms are small but efficient and the beds are very comfy. If I went back I would ask for a room with a view of the Hudson though because we were given one with a view of the Highline only. The view was cool, but nothing stunning. While I can appreciate the beautiful hotel and its staff, I did feel like they were both a little pretentious."
34,1964,"Sep 9 2009 	Great HotelBut.........	Great Hotel but,brunch needs a tune up sevice is slow, waiters look lost at times.The rooms are the best for 250sqft .The guest are very fun group so we had a great time.The area is the best in New York."
35,1964,"Sep 4 2009	Great style location views	When planning our annual trip to New York, I wanted to get away from the midtown hotels and stay more towards Greenwich Village. We have walked around the Village numerous times,, but have always gotten lost, what with its narrow streets intersecting this way and that, without the perfect grid system of midtown streets. We also have been following the High Line project--the redevelopment of an old elevated railroad platform into a lovingly and cleverly designed landscaped walkway-- as well as the construction of the Standard Hotel straddling it. So when we discovered the Standard would be open during our planned visit, we eagerly booked there. We were able to get a good web-only rate similar to the soft opening rate the hotel initially offered.The Neighbourhood.  The hotel is located in the Meatpacking district just north of the West Village. It straddles the High Line and is quite an impressive sight, 18 stories tall. We first visited this area when the boutique Jeffrey opened on 14th St. a number of years ago . Back then the area truly did consist of mostly meatpacking facilities. A few of these still remain, but most have become designer shops, clubs, lounges and restaurants. The nightlife here is very active--weekdays and weekends we witnessed crowds at 2 am and later--people who require very little sleep and/or don't go to work until the afternoon, if at all. Over the course of our 6 day stay, we saw exactly 3 children in the area, all during daylight hours and none within the hotel itself. The hotel offers queen or king rooms only; 2 people maximum per room.The nearest subway stop is about a 5 minute walk away.The Hotel Public Rooms.There is a large outdoor seating area in front of the lobby, which is smallish but stylish, a bit retro looking. The elevators all have 2 unique video screens playing a mesmerizing continuously scrolling presentation, with music. There are several lounge spaces on the ground floor, both indoors and out, with the largest being outdoors under (and protected by) the High Line--very popular. The restaurant The Standard Grill is adjacent, also with indoor and outdoor seating. Not yet opened is the top (18th) floor lounge/club, which apparently will have pool, and is certain to be a hot spot once it opens in about a month. It will surely be a velvet rope type of place, and I would expect there may be difficulty (or at least a wait) for guests just trying to return to their rooms. Even now, over the weekend there was security at the elevators, asking for room keys and checking guest names from a list. There is a large gym on the 17th floor with fabulous views in 3 directions, including the Hudson River. There is no business center (but Wifi is free) or spa.The Guestrooms.Our web rate was for a Standard Queen, but we were upgraded to a south-facing Superior Queen, a slightly smaller room but with a better view. Apparently all the Standard rooms face north, where one gets a glimpse of the river. High Line and Empire State Building, but mostly one sees a large building being built one block north. From the south-facing rooms, there are virtually no buildings taller that the hotel, so one can clearly see Downtown, the southern tip of the High Line, much better views of the Hudson River, New Jersey and the Statue of Liberty. We were informed at check-in as well as via a letter delivered to the room that the floor-to-ceiling windows were non-reflective, so without your drapes drawn, people below can see EVERYTHING, and this apparently has been an issue, based on things we'd read online. Indeed, whenever we looked down at the High Line, there were always people staring up at the hotel.The room was not large, but I've seen smaller in New York, and things were designed to maximize space--a built-in seating area, 2 sides of the bed placed flush against the wall (the person with the stronger bladder should sleep against the wall). The colour scheme is black, white and beige. The flat screen HD TV froze a lot.The bathroom was tiled in black with a laboratory-like sink and counter fixture. The bath products were cleverly packaged. Very early TA reviews of the hotel mentioned the flooding situation involving the shower, and we bore witness to this in our room. The shower is not enclosed, with only a small glass partition between it and the sink. Only the water temperature can be controlled, not the volume (this is true of practically every hotel shower we've used for the past few years), so the water naturally flows out onto the floor, which is not sloped enough towards the drain. We learned quickly to form a dam using a towel (very large and fluffy by the way) to contain the water. Indeed, after showering, the driest place in the bathroom was in the bathtub, which was huge and open to the bedroom with shutters. The toilet was in a separate water closet.The Staff and Service.The staff was all quite young and stylish, courteous and helpful for the most part. Male staffers seem to outnumber the females. Our one exception was with an unfriendly room service attendant, but this was after midnight and he was doing double duty--taking an order on a mobile phone while delivering our order.This was a fun hotel in a fun location. It's not a 5 star place, nor does it strive to be, but it delivered on most fronts. Again, it's not a place for families with small children or friends who are not intimate with each other. or for business. Coming from Los Angeles, we think this Standard has more to offer than either of the LA Standards."
36,1964,"Sep 2 2009 	The Standard really made my stay!	ABSOLUTELY loved The Standard NY. I've stayed in both the LA Standard hotels with work and thought for my trip to NY I would try the New York one: it didn't disappoint. Innovative decor (and dreamlike elevator video was entrancing) and having floor to ceiling windows was amazing for a visitor to NY.I especially loved the super deep bath with a window through to the room to watch TV after a day pounding the pavements! As I was alone for a few days in NY, it was so nice to come back to a beautiful room every night. I think I would have been rather depressed in an average hotel. Such good value for money- don't put up your prices when you get really popular!Just amazing. I would live at The Standard if I could. Modern and trendy and quirky without being pretentious- the staff were all really helpful and friendly, and knew where the great places to go are eg Vintage shopping and Frueza Brutal that I can imagine a lot of hotels wouldn't tell you about. Great location- right next to Diana Fustenberg's studio and not far from Bleaker St which I loved. Even the room service guys would stand and have a chat about your day. Food amazing at The Grill too- I remember the brioche from the LA Standard and was really chuffed to see it again!All I want to know is- where did you get the kissing dogs salt and pepper shakers- so so cute.Thanks so much, I fell in love with NY and this hotel. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed my stay and am already planning to come back and stay again with my boyfriend for my 30th Birthday next year."
37,1964,"Sep 1 2009 	Super sexy we loved The Standard NY.	We don't usually go Boutique Hotel when in Manhattan, but on a friends tip, we booked a room here. We were only in the city for one night, but our stay here made the most of our short visit. With floor to ceiling windows you knew you were in NY. How great to wake up to a view of the Hudson. Definitely a sexy vibe with the wood paneling, low slung bed, exposed shower and the city looking in at you.We came in on a Red-eye a little worse for wear, but how can you not smile when you are greeted by the cute boys in the nasty little Bavarian-inspired shorts and yellow checked shirts. Everything is happier in yellow including the street level turn-style entrance. Great transition between the sidewalk and the super sleek lobby, you know you have arrived somewhere special. The staff was so helpful getting us as early a check-in as possible, they took our phone number and called as soon as a room was available. A hotel is only as good as the people working there, A+.We spent the day up at the Met, Central Park then checked out a few Galleries. Once we returned to the hotel we never had to leave again. The Meatpacking District has great restaurants, amazing shopping, the Chelsea Market, and the new Highline. We recommend enjoying a drink in the hotel lounge, the bartender is more than generous with the Vodka and there's great people watching. We missed checking out the views from the gym, next time."
38,1964,Aug 27 2009 	The Standard New York Exceeded Expectations	I traveled to New York for business for nine days. The Standard New York provided me a home away from home. The staff was everything a staff should be from housekeeping to front desk. I had other friends staying at he hotel and had equally excellent things to say about their stay. I am will be traveling to New York often and look forward to staying at the Standard New York again. I flew from New York to Las Vegas and the Standard New York was on the local news in Vegas the next morning. They were talking about what a unique place the Standard New York is. Made me miss it just a bit.
39,1964,"Aug 26 2009 	Not If You Need Your Sleep	all other elements of a hotel stay are secondary to getting a good night's sleep- and that's impossible at the standard: early morning hammering and drilling ruin an otherwise well-run establishment.the truly pointless aspect of this is that the construction work rarely takes more than a couple of hours to complete- hours that could just as easily occur in the afternoon when the overseas traveller, night-owl, or holiday-taker would be much less-likely to be disturbed. yet, despite countless complaints to clueless staff and management over a multi-month stay, the hammering begins again the next morning at 8am (and is once again completed before lunch). were it not for this pointless insensitivity to the basic needs of its guests, my review of the standard would be complimentary. but mismanagement at this level borders on the criminal."
40,1964,"Aug 1 2009 	magical !	Stayed with my 9 years old son for 3 nights. Very friendly and nice staffs. Location is fantastic, literally above the Highline ! If you walk around the neighborhood, you find a very cool shop unexpectedly. For snack or breakfast go to the Chelsea Market.Great architecture. I loved the lighting of the elevator lobby on the 1st floor. Fab view from bedroom .There is something magical about this hotel.Beautiful stay. Thank you, Standard:-)"
41,1964,"Jul 26 2009 	NYC hottest new beds	I was pretty sure that Andre Balazs' new hotel can't be disappointing (he is already a respected brand, NYC king of cool) but didn't expect that much for the less than 300$ per night. By saying that much I mean: sleek corner room with a view to trendy Meatpacking District incl. High Line, roomy bathroom stuffed with excellent Kiss My Face organic products, tasty breakfast to start the day ....just to name few. As expected Standard service is truly New York style - everything goes smooth and easy, I just love staff attitude, not to mention they all are good looking. I'm really looking back to stay at Standard asap, which is probably this September. There is no place like Standard!"
42,1964,"Jul 25 2009 	Sublime!!!!	Not sure how they do it, but somehow this hotel has the ultimate cool factor ....from the chic design and decorating to the gorgeous staff and breathtaking floor to ceiling views...and yet they are so nice...really nice. Everything was immaculate. The linens were so cozy I didn't want to get out of bed until Irealized I could take a shower and still see the view. My husband I lived in the city for many years and never experienced it quite like this...amazing...can't wait to go back"
43,1964,"Jul 20 2009 	Lots of swagga	I stayed at the Standard over the 4th weekend and travelled solo. Upon arriving at 10:30 am, I expected to just check my bags and head out for shopping. However, I was told that a room was available and allowed to check-in. (Great b/c I was a bit tired.) I also received an upgrade from a standard to a superior queen room. I knew what to expect upon arrival as I had researched the hotel before visiting. Well, many reviews got it right. The lobby is not typical and pretty cool. The hotel staff fab looking and very friendly. My room did feel like I was on a cruise ship. I don't think it was b/c it was so small but actually the design regarding the ceiling, the low furniture (very Ikea like) and closet like toilet area. I loved the floor to ceiling windows, views of the Hudson, and my peek-a-boo bathroom, AWESOME &amp; SO SEXY. If you looking for a romantic, luxurious, or even an elegant hotel, the Standard is not for you. However, the hotel is ultra cool and hip. The neighborhood was great as it had plenty of shopping and dining and the hotel is conveniently located b/w uptown and SOHO. Oh, I did dine in the Living Room area as I worked. The service was a bit slow for moment there. I had to get up and request service and a menu. But afterwards, the host was very attentive to me and he even recommended an awesome drink. I'm already planning a trip back in August. I hope I get that upgrade again."
44,1964,"Jul 17 2009 	Sexy Hotel; It's a Soft Opening	It's a very sexy hotel, design-wise. The rooms, though small, or really nicely appointed. The bathroom shower was neat, with its own window overlooking the city. The people who work at the hotel were uniformly friendly, not snooty. The location is neat, right above the new high line, which is the coolest thing to happen to NYC since they redeveloped the piers. This entire neighborhood has a great vibe. I didn't try the hotel restaurant. My only complaint is that -- even though the hotel is brand new, and, in fact, still under construction on the top floors -- the room was already showing signs of a little wear and tear (broken lamp shade, and mold on the wall behind a curtain, where there must have been a leak of some kind). I would definitely stay again; but the hotel's staying power will depend on whether they invest in maintaining the rooms, in my opinion."
45,1964,"Jul 16 2009 	Amazing style people location and service is the pinnacle.	In NYC on business, I usually stay at a different hotel based on where I need to be for work / events. This time, however, my business was at the Chelsea Pier athletic complex, so this was a closer option. I work in the apparel, fashion, and style markets so I'm always looking for something new and different - found it at The Standard. Beautiful and simple decor, amazing room set up and incredibly comfortable beds and room layout, it reminded me of some top tier places in Norway and Switzerland in simplicity and elegance. The staff was amazingly helpful on several occasions when I needed help. The uniforms are hip, the place is up and coming - but NO ONE that visits will be out of place, uncomfortable, or even put off by the style...it's not &quot;uber hip&quot; but very cool. The location is coming into it's own with shopping and amazing night life - the bar at the hotel was excellent for entertaining clients. We had a dessert and drinks, which were fantastic and the food looked fine. Excellent overall experience - there are likely less expensive options, but not with this location or sense of service dedication."
46,1964,"Jul 14 2009 	Loved it and would go back!	The kind staff, fantastic location and appealing design make this hotel a winner. Loved the floor to ceiling windows in every room. Very expansive feel and views. Definitely would return."
47,1964,"Jul 12 2009 	Enlighted skyline 	We got two rooms; 12-09 and 11-24. Both rooms had a view uptown. The rooms had offcourse a stunning view.In the close neighbourhood there are a lot of nice eateries and restaurants. We had lunch several times here.The bathtowel were big and soft, wich I like. The watertap was easy to screw a little too hard and wet your paints, but I learned that quickly. One late night we before heading out for the city we turned of all the lights in the room, grabbed 2 cold beers from the minibar. We were laying down on the bed and just watching out the window, and enjoying the awesome view of the enlighted skyline, can be recommended.I managed to forget my passport in the hotel safe. Witch I first found out in a taxi on Van Wyck-road heading for JFK. With no time to turn around I called the hotel, and they sent an employee in a taxi to JFK with my passport. Arriving just minuts before the airline stoped the check in for my flight back home to Norway. I`m so grateful for that. Talk about service : )I also put out some nice pictures of the rooms and the hotel . I`m planning a trip with my brothers and definitely want to stay here then"
48,1964,"Jul 12 2009 	Too much flash and no substance	I travel almost every other week and stay in a lot of hotels, and as a design and construction professional I do not believe I have ever stayed anywhere that misses the point of a hotel more than the Standard. Yes it has a great view as long as you look out to the river, just don't look down at all the trash behind the buildings below. Yes it is close to the nightlife, but that is a double edged sword as the the builder obviously cut corners on the glass selection to prevent all that noise below from interferring with your quiet time. I believe I have stressed the two good points. The rooms are so affected that I could go on and on, but some of the highlights are that the only place to use a blow dryer is in the wet room (which was the all in one bathroom). I believe most people know you shouldn't use a hair dryer standing in a wet area. At this hotel you have little choice. The toilet in a &quot;closet&quot; ont he opposite side of the hall had all the makings of a claustrophbic bowel movement. There wasn't even enough room in the the toilet room to house an additional roll of toilet paper. Better not get stuck there with the last sheet becasue the extra roll was stored in the closet across the hallway. I could go on and on, but the point is really, whoever designed this place has put way to much emphasis on being cool rather than designing an effective room. As well they have hired a staff of under 30 types with little hotel experience, and when confronted with an issue mostly just are to cool to deal with it.. If you are young and well off and don't know what a good hotel experince should really be like, this is the palce for you. Oh did I mention they missed my wake up call two days in a row. The third day the manager called me personally to insure I got it."
49,1964,"Jul 12 2009 	Amazing hotel which has great sense of fun with fantastic views	I picked The Standard Hotel as it is close to my Sister's place in New York and it's directly above the new High Line Park which is an amazing new park on an old elevated railway. Being a new hotel I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say it is an amazing place. Most hotels have a certain atmosphere about them. You know what I mean, some scream 'business' or 'budget' or 'help i'm stuck in the 90's' but with The Standard there is none of that kind of aura. It's a place where you can be who you want to be and do what you want to do. Everything even down to the design of the rooms has a sense of fun about it (even some of the items in the Mini Bar)!My room had an amazing view down the Hudson towards The Statue of Liberty and downtown. While not being one of the biggest rooms, the clever layout and floor to ceiling glass made it seem spacious and roomy with a good sized and very comfortable bed and its own 'lounge area'. Other clever design details allow you to sit and enjoy a movie while lounging in the massive bathtub thanks to the window between the bathroom and the sleeping area. The overall design is spectacular and everything has been thought about down to the last detail. There is even a rather clever animation of 'heaven to hell' in each of the lifts. In fact I would love to have that as a screen saver for my Mac!The staff are friendly and helpful and don't pressure you. The Concierge even managed to get me a table at short notice for the newly opened and very popular Standard Grill which is superb. My sister has even gone as far as declaring it her new favorite New York restaurant! Room Service is great, efficient and very reasonably priced as is the Mini Bar and there is a great movie/tv/music choice on the generously sized flat screen TV. I also had free wi-fi which based on my stay at another NY hotel seems to be quite rare. As for downsides I don't think I could name any that I had during my stay. I had a really great time and have already recommended it to a couple of my friends. I'm looking forward to staying there next time I travel to New York!"
50,1964,"Jul 11 2009 	A perfect stay - every single time!!	I have stayed at the Standard Hotel at least half a dozen times, both for business and leisure since it opened. Every time, I am blown away by the great rooms, comfortable beds, amazing amenities (their organic kiss my face products are outstanding), great views, cool, but not pretentious ambiance!What makes this hotel truly exceptional, is the staff. I have been blown away by their general awesomeness, and willingness to go above and beyond. Whenever I return to the standard, I feel like I am being welcomed by friends who always look after me well. Special shout out to Jesse Davidson and Adan Maldenado - two amazing bellmen, and Jennifer Hazzard, the best concierge I have ever met!I hope that they will keep their personal touch, and amazing staff as the hotel keeps getting more popular."
51,1964,"Jul 10 2009 	Exciting High Line location gorgeous views superb modern design within and without	Even though this hotel is at the tip of Manhattan, because of the transit options, everything is accessable easily. There are plenty of walkaround options in food, drink, shopping and culture. Uptown is a subway ride away - and fast.The High Line Park is not to be missed for its views and ambience and the feeling of being intimate with this glorious city.The rooms are small and beautifully designed. I was able to borrow a house computer which was very handy. It felt very luxurious and accomodating to be there."
52,1964,Jul 9 2009 	A unique hotel having amazing views fabulous location friendly 	This hotel is quite unique. Position is central &amp; close to several modes of transport &amp; has access to many interesting sightseeing venues as well as affording casual strolls along the Hudson River.Even after several days we still still found new trendy facets of this hotel.The restaurant has just opened &amp; service &amp; food is highly recommened. We loved it.All staff offer friendly &amp; efficient service.Best of all was the bed! What a comfortable mattress &amp; that was very important to us as we have bad backs. We would recommend this hotel.
53,1964,"Jul 9 2009 	Fantastic NY experience enhanced by well trained eager staff	I stayed on two different occasions in June and July a combination of business and pleasure trips. I was accompanied by my wife, 11 year old daughter, mother in law and two business colleagues. The staff accomodated all sorts of requests, the Bell staff were excellent, the concierge was young and obliging. The views are unequalled. The location is perfect. The Standard Grill was perfect from day one. I am a native New Yorker living in LA and I make frequent trips to NY. This trip, plus the return trip a few days later, were both last minute and I couldn't get into my regular hotel (The Gaansvort) I shall be returning to The Standard from now on."
54,1964,"Jul 9 2009 	very nice minor misses?	First of all, what you've heard about the Standard is true: The views are incredible. Right now I am looking our over the Hudson and the Highline. I can see the Statue of Liberty and the light is magic. THe outside and public areas of this building are just incredible and are the kind of things that design conscious people will go nuts for. The staff, contrary to some reviews, are really, really nice and unpretentious. They are also really on it, which cannot be said for all design hotels. The neighborhood is great as well; it's pretty much the center of hippness these days. The only misses are that if you are expecting total perfection in design and &quot;fit and finish,&quot; particularly in the rooms, you won't find it. What you will experience is sort of like the difference between furniture from West Elm and DWR. The former is cool looking, but maybe not so well built or thought out as the latter. I say this only because this place has received so much ink for the design that if you arrived thinking it would just be high end everything, it's not quite there and you'll be disappointed. That said, you'd have to be blind to miss the fact that you're staying in a landmark and one of the most unique buildings (let alone hotels) in the country. Finally, try the Standard burger, it is killer!"
55,1964,Jul 8 2009 	A must	The Standard literally took my breathe away. Situated on top of the beautiful High Line in the meatpacking district the sublime desine is at home in NYC. The rooms were fantastic mid century modern and very comfortable. One cannot write about the hotel without mentioning the views! Floor to ceiling windows provide amazing views. Everything was exceptional. We already booked for next month!
56,1964,"Jul 7 2009 	The Standard was the perfect complement to my 4th of July jaunt.	The Standard is hip, chic, and full of surprises. This traveler could not have been happier about the stay at the Standard, a High Line-straddling treat of a hotel. The greeting by the very comely staff was a fantastic way to begin our stay at the Standard. I had stayed at Standard Downtown in LA and expected the same level of service. It was certainly granted in spades. Our room was fantastic. The view was phenomenal. We were able to escape the masses of 4th of July fireworks gawkers in our Hudson River view room. The High Line just below provided excellent people watching, and the rooms in the hotel provided them the same, I'm sure. The linens were crisp. The bathroom products were to die for and were more than ample. Having a shower and a very deep tub was fun and functional. I have no complaints to register. I'll be very happy to stay at the Standard as soon as the need arises or fun calls."
57,1964,"Jul 7 2009 	The best views in NYC	What a great hotel! Our room was upgraded from a standard queen to a superior queen, to give us stunning floor to ceiling views over the Hudson and downtown NY; the rooms also have brilliant views of the Highline, since it literally runs through the hotel. Try and ask for a room on one of the higher floors, for the best experience. The room itself may be slightly on the small side, but was plenty big enough for our 4-night stay, and was very cleverly designed - there is a cosy seating area with a table, and hidden storage for your clothes and luggage. The bed is amazingly comfy (and positioned to give you the best view of the NY skyline), and the bathroom was oozing with style (great powerful shower, and HUGE tub). Very generous sizes of Kiss my Face bubble bath, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body cream etc... which appeared to be restocked almost every day! (no need to bring any of your own products if you're staying here!). Sure, it could do with a few hooks to hang up your stuff while you're showering, but that's a small detail.The staff were friendly and helpful - I didn't find them snooty at all. And I actually really liked the fact that the service was generally more informal than most equivalent hotels. Yes, they're all &quot;beautiful&quot;, but then this is the Meatpacking... which leads me on to location. Ideal. More bars and restaurants at ourdoorstep than we knew what to do with in 4 days, and only 5 mns walk to the nearest subway station. We stayed there on the &quot;soft opening&quot; rates, which made it excellent value. I hope they don't put the rates up too much as I'd love to stay here again when we next come back to NY."
58,1964,"Jul 6 2009 	Extraordinary View	Stayed at the Standard on July 4th in a standard suite. 180 degree views from floor to ceiling windows are extraordinary. Macy's fireworks were spectacular. I read a few of the negative reviews, but we thought that the room, hotel, and staff were great."
59,1964,"Jul 3 2009 	Like a Paris efficiency apartment in a glass box open on Manhattan	Good design, great big bathtub with a view, pleasant work table with window that opens, literally, onto the city. Feels more like an apartment. Nice walking neighborhood, very friendly vibe."
60,1964,"Jul 2 2009 	Decent for a short stay	The location is GREAT if you enjoy the nightlife that the meat packing district has to offer. Lobby decor is super trendy and cool. Staff was OK; nothing special. The room was enough to sleep and shower, but I definitely wouldn't have kept sane if I spent more than 2 nights there! The bed was comfortable, but practically on the floor. The TV was right in front of the bed. I would not recommend it for older people with ailments, anyone who is tall, or if you have back problems. Also, this hotel is NOT for families or shy couples. The shower has 1/2 a pane of glass separating it from the sink/vanity. Yes, the floor will get wet. The separate toilet room is definitely not for anyone who is overweight! It is a bit claustrophobic in there.The floor to ceiling windows made for an awesome view, though. This hotel is not for everyone, but decent for a short stay in the city."
61,1964,"Jun 29 2009 	The nicest staff in New York	Yes, the views at the Standard are spectacular and the design is groovy and interesting. But what is really amazing is how lovely the staff is. My daughter and I felt so welcomed and cared-for by everyone from the front desk clerk to the bell-guy to the phone operator and concierge. I am not sure that we have ever gotten such good service (and with a light friendly touch by the way, not the heavy duty &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;madam&quot; kind of manner which is in it's own way a bit annoying) in a New York hotel, at any price level. The rooms were on the smaller side but the view overwhelmingly compensates for the lack of square footage. Our great stay there does make you realize that the experience of a place is completely colored by your experience of the people."
62,1964,"Jun 25 2009 	Best Service 	While this hotel is the epitome of contemporary in its design its service is old-fashion hospitality. The bellman literally ran to help my colleague and I with our luggage from the taxi upon our arrival. The front desk was genuine and warm in their friendly welcome, offering information about the area and was always gracious throughout our stay whenever engaged. The concierge was fun, friendly and certainly gave us a fabulous recommendation for dinner. Later when we saw him, he followed up and was genuinely pleased we enjoyed his recommendation. Once in my lovely room I had some technical challenges with getting on the wireless network - within five minutes someone came up to my room, helped me and got me connected - all with a smile! While the staff is what impressed me so much, I will add the hotel is lovely - room was immaculate and very comfortable. The tub was amazing, and the bed very comfortable. I highly recommend the Standard."
63,1964,"Jun 23 2009 	Misses the mark	The positive: The location of the hotel is fantastic and the views cannot be beat, especially from the shower/bath. Being right over the Highline is amazing too. Room was very clean, quiet and comfortable for the most part.The negative: The build quality of this hotel is not great--i think they either built too quickly or cut corners. The door didn't close properly ever b/c it seemed frame was warped--i had to slam it shut and literally kick it open several times. The hotel is brand new, this shouldn't happen. The cable went out multiple times in two days. The check out from TV didn't work when i left. When you are on the Highline and look up at the hotel, you'll see how the cement frame from floor to floor on outside has shifted in all different directions--it is not a straight line--just take a look when you are there and you'll see. The room is a little cold and uninviting. I get what they were going for, mid-century/Danish, but it somehow misses the mark and feels more like the inside of an RV with strange bolsters and railing around the room. There is a misplaced peice of furniture that is the bar that sits in the hallway; it looks like it was an afterthought and left over from a previous owner, waisting precious space. The staff, though extremely polite and friendly, are just not up to hotel staff at other established hotels--it feels like college kids are running the hotel. It could be that the property is still green and will work the kinks out, but right now, it just not there. Finally, the lobby, though trying to be cool is really unimpressive in person and too small in scale. Would I stay here again, probably not--there are better hotels near by that have a better vibe and energy than this place. Was it a bad stay, not by any means, just misses the mark."
64,1964,Jun 20 2009 	Great value for your money	Coming to NYC after 25 years was very exciting and once we arrived at the Standard we knew we were in for a treat. The staff were friendly and accommodating. We loved the design of the hotel straight away and were not disappointed when we saw our room. Frank Llyod Wright meets the Jetsons! Floor to ceiling windows provided an impressive view. The elevators are quite a trip too... The location was fine - felt safe and was within walking distance of most of what we wanted to see. We enjoyed our stay and were very happy with the Standard and it's staff.
65,1964,"Jun 16 2009 	A bit dude but great sleeps	Stayed here for five nights, with my dog, who garnered far more attention than I did from the staff. For the most part, the staff was lovely, but I do concur with an earlier reviewer who referred to them as hipster. Mind you, if you are staying in the Meat Packing District, you need to buy into it and it was no surprise that the front office staff were all very attractive, young, stylish and well-coiffed. The housekeeping staff were all lovely and attractive and overly, far more friendly than some of the young front end people. Overall, the housekeeping staff was terrific! The rooms have a bit of a dorm room meets camper trailer feel to them. That said, I was paying the soft rate while they complete construction and have no complaints about that at all. The beds were very comfortable an the quality of linens was nice. I slept really well. But the white quilted blankets made me feel like I was in school and the seating area totally reminded me of camping when I was a kid. I would not be surprised if the table collapses into a bed. I do have one big complaint about this hotel. They need to seriously upgrade their product line of soaps and shampoos. They are also just a bit DUDE on that front. Spruce bubble bath? Ick! All the scents were very masculine. I'm not looking for super flowery either, but I don't want to come out of the bath smelling like a Christmas tree. The bubble bath and shower gel were a huge disappointment, especially given the massive bathtub. The packaging of all that stuff was also terrible. It looked like generic shampoos you might pick up at Walmart. They really need to upgrade that stuff, especially once they are off the soft rates and people are paying full price. The towels, however, are fantastic! Nothing like a massive bathsheet. A bathrobe would have been nice too. In general, I had a great stay and given where all my friends live, it was the perfect neighbourhood for me, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for one of these rooms. It just doesn't feel that luxurious. Clean and comfortable? Absolutely! Luxury? Not really. But perhaps that not what they are aiming for. The architecture of this building is great!"
66,1964,"Jun 8 2009	OMG the VIEWS!	We were delighted by our short stay at the Standard. We reserved 2 standard queen rooms. We had to beg for the reservation since normally they have a two night minimum, but when I explained this was a special occasion (our daughter's 21st birthday), they were kind enough to make an exception. We couldn't get in on the soft opening deal of $195/night, but felt the $265/a night quoted price was pretty good for NYC. We were wowed by the contemporary decor that greeted us in the lobby. I had not been to NYC in 16 years, and was quite surprised by the friendliness of the staff, not even a molecule of snootiness--warm, friendly, fun, and helpful. We were blown away when we were told BOTH rooms had been upgraded in honor of our daughter's birthday. Our daughter was given a river view room that was mind-blowing. Although all rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows with amazing views, at the foot of her bed was a panoramic view of the Hudson river that she will never forget. Even the statue of Liberty was visible. The totally full moon and fireworks display rather added to the excitement of this awesome view in the evening. For New York standards, the room was nicely sized, with a nice contemporary table, huge tub, and rainforest shower. Big fluffy towels (lots of them), and an amazingly well stocked minibar were part of the charm. Our second room (upgraded to a standard King) had a great city view showcasing the Empire State Building. The bed was so comfortable, with wonderful linens. The flat screened TV, glass-walled rain forest shower (in the middle of the room) and comfy contemporary chairs (to position for staring out the window or using at the table) were nice touches as well. The Elevators--so fun! Cartoon/animated-like displays of &quot;Wonder World&quot; (hard to describe but a must-see) were whimsical, entertaining, and unique. Clearly this hotel does not take itself overly seriously as so many NY hotels do. The staff courteously accommodated every request--supplying shaving cream and toothpaste on request, and answering all questions regarding directions, travel times, etc. Room service breakfast no longer free and restaurant not yet open, but we ordered coffee and rolls and it was extremely reasonable and prompt. The only suggestion I would make is installing black-out linings behind the drapes (the sun REALLY makes itself known in the morning), but on second thought, who has time to sleep in while visiting the Big Apple? The hip meat packing district where the hotel is located is really convenient in terms of being in a central location and very &quot;mid town buzzy&quot; and young. I highly recommend this hotel. although apparently all the views are great, if at all possible, splurge and get a room with a river view, it's spectacular and worth it for a memorable experience in New York."
67,1964,"Jun 6 2009 	Alright	Stayed here for four nights in May.Rooms are very nice and the location is perfect, very close to bars, nightclubs and shopping as well as to the quaint West Village.Our room had black hairs in the bathtub that weren't removed on our second night either but upon complaining they did clean it very well.Breakfast that is being sent to the rooms while the restaurant is being build is average.Not too sure about the hipster staff who seem to be hired on looks only and appear as if though they are doing you a favour when you ask for assistance etc."
68,1964,"Jun 6 2009 	Cannot Wait to Return	I stayed here at the end of May in one of the standard queen rooms on the 11th floor. Everything was perfect for me during my stay - from the friendly reception staff to the concierge guys who always left their station to hail me a cab to the gorgeous model guy who brought me my in-room complimentary breakfast. I loved the room - stunning views of the river (i could see Liberty Statue clearly) and lower Manhattan clearly visible through the floor-ceiling windows, nice comfy bed low to the floor with plenty of pillows, convenient plug outlets for my laptop and cell. The complimentary toiletries (Kiss My Face brand) were ample sized, larger than norm - face cream was 2oz.. Love, loved the deep tub. After my 13 hr flight, it was a treat to fill it and soak, with and be able to enjoy the sunset - clear view through the bedroom. I did not experience any air conditioning problems mentioned in some of the reviews here - my room maintained perfect ambient temps for me. I was neither hot nor cold. The hotel is in a great neighbourhood with lots of boutiques and restaurants. My room was directly above the Brass Monkey - their patio was packed till 3am. I felt safe walking around at night. The minibar was stocked with lots of different options for alcohol &amp; non-alcoholic drinks (bottles were not &quot;mini&quot; sized either) and snacks. The prices were really reasonable and it wasn't one of those cheesy spring-loaded fridges either. I can see that this hotel is good for singles or young/hip couples. Not kid friendly rooms or for those who don't like the modern look and decor. I wish they had low flow toilets - that was the one unit that was not modern. The bathroom should have had a waste bin and it would have been nice to have a robe."
69,1964,Jun 5 2009 	I have no words	I complained to the staff that I could not sleep at night because of the noise that going on outside. They did not do anything about it. I found that very rude but the hotel itself was very nice. Hope you get better staff.
70,1964,"Jun 3 2009 	Great hotel great location...	We spent two nights at The Standard after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. It was a great hotel; very trendy both inside and out but not at all intimidating. So different from a chain hotel in midtown. The staff also looked the part; they were helpful especially at check in - giving us a south facing room (which are a higher rate than what we had paid). The room (queen standard) was cool. A little on the small side (not much room to have two suitcases open) but the floor to ceiling views were fantastic. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the design of the rooms. The bathroom was quite unique with a great two person bath and the views are still visible from the bath. The mini bar has a great selection and is really reasonably priced as is the room service menu. And a really comfy bed but our only problem was that the sheets were not fresh on our first night. It is a great location to explore the meatpacking district, the village and chelsea."
71,1964,"May 24 2009 	Great Hotel great location	My partner and I stayed 3 nights at THE STANDARD. We really enjoyed our tastefully decorated room with a fantastic view over the meatpacking district, Hudson River and the Empire State Building in sight. The concierge and the staff in general were very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfeast delivered each morning to our room was delicious. The location of the hotel is just perfect. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and clubs in this neighbourhood. We would return to this hotel anytime. It offers good value for an expensive city like New York."
72,1964,"May 23 2009 	very small rooms poor service... fancy? overrated	The standard at this hotel is really low! very small bedrooms, beds and bathrooms... it seems to be on a boat. it is absolutely overrated, especially for the real pour service it is offered. Don't try to wait for room service... they will simply ignore you.Bad experience overall."
73,1964,"May 11 2009 	Form over function	First the positives: Great location if you like youthful nightlife and/or excellent resaurants. Wonderful high-end boutiques and great window shopping. Friendly service. Gorgeous looking people everywhere. Very fair price, at least at the moment.The negatives: Really uncomfortable rooms. Engineers there pointed out some flaws in the ventilation that were impossible to correct because the architect won out over the engineers. We had to change rooms. Bathroom design is more annoying than &quot;cool&quot;. The furniture in the rooms is very uncomfortable but very &quot;modern&quot;. The staff seemingly has no training in the hotel industry. Extremely pleasant but clueless. The doormen will actually open the door for you about 20% of the time. They are otherwise discussing their next picture-shoot. I really wanted to like this place because it's new I love the area. If you are twenty-something I am sure you will love it. But if you are looking for a 4-star hotel and are over 30, you will be gravely disappointed."
74,1964,"May 10 2009 	Wonderful Stay	My partner and I live in NYC but decided to stay for a night here to celebrate a birthday and get out of our usual neighborhood.Put simply we had a wonderful stay at The Standard. We stayed in a West-facing &quot;Standard Suite&quot; on a high floor. Glass walls from floor to ceiling on three sides, including the bathroom. The view is simply unforgettable and the suite design and layout was gorgeous. A big two-person bathtub, a comfortable (if squeaky) king sized bed. A two-head rain shower in the bathroom. Because of the very modern design, yes, some water does get around the bathroom etc but who cares?The AC does work with a min temp of 60F. With all shades drawn it does get a lot of sunlight so that may account for why a previous reviewer found it warm. Room service was delicious. Homemade ice cream, a tasty cheeseburger, complimentary breakfast. It was not overpriced by room service standards, either. There appears to be several bars downstairs but the hotel did not seem noisy at night. The room was very quiet."
75,1964,"May 6 2009 	Perfect Anniversary Spot	First of all, the air conditioning does most definitely work (now)! Place is very cool, not just the temperature. Staff is super accomodating. Rooms are funky, views spectacular. Rates during &quot;soft opening&quot; are very reasonable. Clear shower door to bedroom is a bit unusual, but can be fun for a short visit! Great place to stay if you want to be in that area."
76,1964,May 4 2009 	Twice at the standard...	I stayed 4 nights at the Standard Hotel in Manhattan and all I can say it was just fantastic. I'd stayed 2 years ago at the Standard Hotel in Hollywood ...this is why I decided to try it in New York too.It's really great and the location in the Meatpacking is the best in Manhattan (just close to the coolest restaurants and shops...) My room (1013) had a spectacular views over Hudson river and Statue of liberty. The room was very bright and cool. This is my 9th time in Manhattan and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!
77,1964,"May 3 2009 	Fantastic Views Great Value	I live in Brooklyn and wanted a night away with my husband to kick back and enjoy some of the city. We chose the Standard because of the location and the cool architecture.The Standard delivered.  The wall of floor to ceiling window was gorgeous - you literally could see the whole city when laying down in bed super clean + new comfy bed The room was very large by NYC standards Sweet complimentary breakfast brought to the door (lots of good coffee and pastries for 2) Walking distance to all the Chelsea galleries View of the Highline + the city can not be overstated.The staff was very nice, they upgraded us to a king room and put us on the highest floor upon request and free of charge. The decor in the lobby was a very cool retro-kitch and the glass shower in the room was super cool.The noise from the street was loud (and mind you, I live in Brooklyn), loud enough that we had to play some music to drown it out. But whatever, if The Standard spent more money to sound proof the room, I wouldn't be able to afford to stay there :-) The TV didn't work, but who could care? I'm not spending a night in a hotel to watch TV. Oh, and we stayed next to the elevator and weren't bother by the noise.Overall, a really great value and a great experience, highly recommended."
78,1964,"Apr 29 2009 	incredible view NYC size roomgreat staff and hip location	the hotel is located in the hippest place in town,the hudson views were incredible and featured the statue of liberty,on sat nite the area was thronged and we had a GREAT dinner at the spice market a block away,the people watching was AWESOME as we had an outdoor seat and saw all THE BEAUTIFUL people walk by,the room was compact but functional with a small bathroom with soaking tub with a view thru the bedroom to the river,the south facing rooms have a view of downtown, the village the river and the statue,the views here are better than the city view (i think)the staff were friendly and efficent, and i an critical LOL rest.not open yet, 30 mins for Bfast delivery , overall a great experience, remember compact rooms"
79,1964,Apr 24 2009 	Their AC does not work	If you want to sweat while you sleep stay here. The entire hotel lacks ventilation and the AC barely works throughout the entire hotel. Each time I called and complained that my room was too hot they sent up an &quot;engineer&quot; who did not seem to do a thing. Otherwise the hotel is great but this one problem in my view is pretty major. With the sweltering heat in NYC they are going to have some major complaints.
80,1964,"Apr 21 2009 	CASUAL SLICK ARCHITECTURE AND FABULOUS ROOM SERVICE!!!	I always have been an avid fan of the standard hotel in LOS ANGELES. I was very excited when Andre Balaz open a property in NEW YORK!!!! The VIEWS are amazing, architecture is flawless, the rooms are spacious yet comfy!!!! my stay has been beyond my expectations from the hotel to the great service.The best service i had is ROOM SERVICE. The free breakfast is delicious and Alexis the room service server had a great personality and he really makes my morning easy!!! very upbeat person!!!!!!OVERALL my stay of course is rated TEN STARS!! Definitely will be coming back for my next visit!"
81,1964,"Apr 19 2009 	New Cool in the Meatpacking District	Though the hotel is still in 'soft' opening stage...if you are looking for a new cool place to stay, this is it! Forget the Gansevoort or Soho House...Andre's latest fits the bill. A purpose built stylish piece of architecture in its own right...you can't miss the 70's style over-the-highway design. Yellow doors on the corner with hip doormen mark your arrival. Plain entry hall with neat little bar off to the left...rooms are floor to ceiling windows with funky all in one bathrooms...stayed in two different types both were cool. The toiletries are plentiful and practical. The towels white and fluffy. The mini bar is built into a retro-new desk/bureau. Flat screen tv, free wireless and a free breakfast of coffee/pastry/juice brought to you by decidecly good looking staff any time from 6am..what's not to like. The location is perfect for the MP district. The concierge was really helpful and low key - never 'hyping or selling' the latest place - but rather, asking the right questions about what you want (noisy, dark, 'scene', etc). I loved the experience. A HUGE step above the all too knowing Gansevoort (long since sold out) or the dark and faux-hip 'W' experience (so cookie cutter!). When the rooftop bar opens it will be THE place...I just hope it doesnt lose the sense of understated cool. Restaurant wasn't open when I stayed in March, but should be an advantage for room service/dining. The view over the Hudson or the Empire State is incredible at night (and day)...so, if you want a cool NY place to stay, this is the new spot. Please Mr. B.... don't 'sell out' to the 'scene'."
82,1964,"Apr 11 2009 	Anything but Standard!	Stayed at The Standard at the end of a two week holiday, on the 12th floor our room had breathtaking views, so much so, on one night we chose to return to the room to look out over the downtown skyscape - from our room we could see Lady Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge sparkling at night and the Empire State building. Even when showering we were at the same height as the Gansevooft's roof deck! It doesnt get any better than this! The fit out is edgy, as is the architecture. On the first day we left the hotel and passed some twentysomethings on the street, I heard one of them say, &quot;Oh [--]&quot; I turned to see what he meant - he was talking about the hotel! That;s the impression you want this hotel has set the Standard of accommodation for our return to NYC!"
83,1964,"Apr 10 2009 	The best service EVER! And fabulous views with a free breakfast.	I'm sorry, but the service was the best I have every experienced, EVER! And trust me I have traveled to Intercontinentals, Grand Hyatts, Four Seasons, etc. The staff were unfailingly polite, helpful, and friendly. The room (we had a suite and paid $500+) was fantastic! It had views of the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty. We had 16 friends over for a party and it didn't feel crowded. Free breakfast was great and room service that I had one night (steak frites) was better than many restaurants. Oh, and free internet - one of my pet peaves with other hotels. The only minimal complaint: the cleaning staff could've done a slightly better job vacuuming. That is it!"
84,1964,"Apr 3 2009 	Another Amazing Stay @ The Standard!	*I have already reviewed The Standard New York once, when I stayed in February, but recently stayed once more @ The end of March &amp; had a great time! The building is architecturally beautiful &amp; I love the part of New York the hotel is situated in--! I was upgraded to a super cool room with Absolutely stunning views of the city (room 1410, Corner Deluxe Queen)---the bathroom had a fabulous free-standing tub with a fantastic waterfall shower---with great views &amp; terrific water pressure! The staff was once again super nice, including Justin, Dwayne, Stephen &amp; Kevin @ The Front Desk---all helpful, efficient, very friendly &amp; seemed focused on pleasing guests. Andrea in Room Service was also very kind! *See the pictures attached---Some are from my first stay &amp; others from the more recent one---the hotel has recently increased rates, but I paid $195 &amp; receieved an amazing up-grade, but I'm not sure if people can still snag those good rates---the rooms are still worth it &amp; the overall experience of the hotel is so different &amp; unique as compared to other hotels---once the restaurant, bars, pool, etc are open, the hotel will be even better!*Even the Mini-Bars (fairly reasonable prices, as compared to other NY hotels..) &amp; bath products are unique!! The mini-bars are packed with items &amp; the lighting is also really good in the rooms, with mood-adjusting, which I really appreciate in a hotel. *Have a GREAT time @ The hotel---It's a very unique place in a sea of trendy hotels. Safe Travels &amp; ENJOY NYC! =)PatrickNYC02 April 2009--"
85,1964,"Mar 29 2009 	Why bother with this hotel when there are so many other choices in NYC?	There is nothing wrong with the hotel except the rude staff. It mostly comes down from the awful manager. That's why the staff thinks it's okay with to rude to their customers as well. A really awful experience, checked out the next day. I will never return or recommend to anyone. With so many choices in New York City, why bother."
86,1964,"Mar 27 2009 	Very cool but renovations are felt	Part of the hotel is still undergoing renovations, so there are some drilling and banging sounds during the day, or technicians knocking on your door in the afternoon, asking to install something, or if you dip in the bath tub overlooking a marvelous view of Manhattan, you might encounter a worker on the other side of the glass, enjoying the marvelous view of you..But none of this really spoiled our enjoyable stay. Location is simply perfect. Staff is extremely nice. Rooms are beautiful, with the floor to ceiling glass walls providing spectacular view. We had a corner room facing north-east with view of mid-town, but it seems that the south facing rooms have a better view of the Hudson.Bear in mind that the hotel still lacks many facilities - there is a lounge, but with no food, there are no fitness or spa facilities, but then the price is reduced until the full opening.Definitely a fun stay"
87,1964,"Mar 19 2009	Amazing Service	The best thing about this hotel was the staff in every situation they were very friendly and accommodating. If they can keep this level of service up they will really put this hotel on the map. The location of the hotel is great, although we found some cabs had a hard time getting to the front door sometimes. The old cobblestone streets, the fantastic restaurants and bars, great shopping in the area all make it a very desirable area to be in. The hotel won't be complete until the summer, but you can't hear or see any construction. I can only imagine how amazing this place will be when the restaurants and the high-line park are complete. The rooms are small and as others have noted the bathroom was our only complaint. Also make sure you don't get a room number that ends in .01, they are adjacent to the elevators and you can hear them coming up and down. The view from the room is amazing.This is a great hotel and make sure you take advantage of the soft opening prices. We will be back."
88,1964,"Mar 13 2009 	The coolest hotel in NYC	Stayed at The Standard last weekend and had a fantastic time. The Building - phenomenal the way its sits over the High LineThe Location - couldn't be better for visiting Chelsea, the West Village, Tribeca and Soho.The Lobby and Reception Staff - fantastic.The Rooms - breathtaking views and cool fit out.This hotel is already hot, but once the top floor restaurant/bar/nightclub, rooftop terrace and gym open it will definately be the hippest hotel in NYC!"
89,1964,"Mar 9 2009 	Breathtaking views	The Room: Very stylish, well designed, really comfortable beds &amp; lovely linens. Incredible views from the glass floor to ceiling windows. The Service: Friendly, polite &amp; attentive. Nice touch that breakfast is brought to your room.The Location: The Meatpacking district is the perfect place to explore downtown. There are so many ultra-cool shops, bars and clubs. Very happening without being noisy.Overview: My husband and I are very fussy travellers, but we've given this hotel full marks for everything with good reason. We've had a wonderful time and there isn't anything we can fault. We should add that we took advantage of the 'soft launch' rate at $195 a night which is why we gave top marks for value."
90,1964,"Mar 4 2009 	Hip Hotel in Meatpacking: Classy and Comfortable	Stayed at hotel for long weekend and have plenty of raves: the staff had to be hired for their looks, but they are also competent and gracious. The tiny room - ours (908) overlooked one of the last meatpacking plants, and with a bird's eye view, we watched the trucks ride off loaded with carcases. Actually, it was &quot;gritty&quot; and fascinating and somehow very urban and real. Love the floor to ceiling windows (one opens - yes!) and it's great to have a table rather than desk (free wifi). No tub in this room, or robes for that peek-a-boo shower. Definitely needs a new shower head, as water spills all over the floor. Bed and linens were as fine as any I have stayed in NYC. Free continental breakfast was a plus - take advantage of transition rates while you can. We heard no construction or water pipe noise. Oh, and the drink prices in the downstairs bar are very reasonable; DJ plays on weekends. We used subway (10 min walk) - not as convenient as midtown if you are a theater buff, but we liked the varied neighborhood shops and restaurants. With Vince and Theory and Tory Burch shops open nearby, GAP won't be far behind. Go before the scene starts to look like Soho."
91,1964,"Feb 28 2009 	Great Stay at The Standard	My wife and I had a wonderful stay recently at The Standard in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. Rooms were normal NYC size, however the design seems to make the most of the space. Don't go with someone you're not too comfortable with as the shower looks out in to the living area. Pretty cool actually. The floor to ceiling windows make for a great view and I loved the 1970's-style appointments. The building itself, is an architectural masterpiece. Service was great and the staff was very friendly. Don't forget to have a drink downstairs in the Living Room Bar. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
92,1964,"Feb 19 2009 	Fantastic hotel - fantastic location - book now!	We just came back to Holland from 4 days in The Standard. We absolutely loved our stay - it was an extraordinary experience.Our room (9.20) had an amazing view on the Hudson river. We looked right at the (far away) Statue of Liberty and could even see the Brooklyn Bridge from our room. The floor to ceiling windows are really great,The rooms are small but very nice:- comfy small bed- great bathroom (albeit very wet as has been said before) with a very big tub- big screen tv (which we didnt use because we rather looked at the view)- big mini barWas everthing perfect? Well almost: if we'd have to name things, we found that there is not much space for your stuff in the room (just one closet behind a curtain) and we missed some accessories like a trash can. But really, this is nitpicking.The only thing we found a bit annoying is that when the neighbours are running the water it is so loud that we couldn't hear our own music (which nicely ran from our iPod in the iPod dock clock radio/speakerset!). For a modern building it seems odd that the pipes are not isolated.As for the hotel being under construction: we didn't notice this at all. Everything operates fine.The lobby/bar is great and the outside terrace will be great in the summer. Staff was very friendly. What else can you wish for?The neighbourhood - this is really one of the best area's in NY we think. Nice restaurants, nice shops and close to the West Village - which we also love. Great restaurant across the street from the Standard if you like Asian food: Spice Garden. Pastis was nice too. To avoid: Revel: they lure you in with a fixed price menu and then tell you they only serve it until 19.30. But even worse: service and food were bad.To get back to The Standard: subway is a 5 min walk from the hotel and it has a straight connection to JFK (AirTrain at subway stop Jamaica)Lastly the rates are very good right now as they're preview rates because they're still finishing the hotel. But despite higher rates next time: we'll surely come back here!"
93,1964,"Feb 15 2009 	Great Chic Hotel	We just returned from celebrating my birthday in NYC. The Standard Hotel really sets the standard for chic, comfortable and friendly hotels. We had a room with a fabulous view of the Hudson River, down to the Statue of Liberty. It's conveniently located for walking all over the city. The people were friendly and helpful. Michael showed us to our room and gave us the &quot;room tour&quot;. We had reasonably priced drinks at the lounge off the very cool lobby..We enjoyed our free Continental breakfast along with a delicious herb and goat cheese omelet that was brought to our room each morning. The bed and linens were the most comfortable of any hotel I've ever been in. This hotel is not fully opened yet but I can't wait to go back when it's completed."
94,1964,"Feb 15 2009 	Fabulous New Hotel in MeatPacking!!!	Took my girlfriend to The Standard on Valentine's Day 2009 for a romantic night away from home in NJ. We pulled up to this place, and the decor from the yellow chairs outside and the yellow doors is just amazing. I had to drive around the block once because I didn't know where to leave my car, but on the second time around - got so lucky and found a spot literally right next to the door. If you are just staying over on a weekend...you are allowed to park there and I recommend it as it saved me the $55 valet charge! The bellhop was nice as can be and took our bags for us as soon as I parked. We arrived at around 3:30pm and our room was not ready yet, however they offered us each a free drink which we were glad to take. An hour later, our room still was not ready (I was starting to get a little upset) but another complimentary drink each saved that from happening!) Finally, our room was ready, just a normal queen room with an &quot;Empire View&quot; What a tremendous view of the empire state building from our floor to ceiling windows! At night it was lit up for Valentines day in white red and pink!...so romantic and so wonderful. The room was perfect. A typical smaller NYC room, however it was very roomy with the most comfortable bed I have slept in in years. There is a nice 42 inch flat screen on the wall with a nice sitting area. One thing I would say about these rooms...dont go with someone you dont know very well! (and I mean very well!) The shower is completly see through. As you sit on the bed, you can see directly into the shower through the glass - very neat if your with your girlfried/wife..not so neat if your with a co-worker!! The bathroom is private, with a door. The tub is massive-and the shower was wonderful! There is no door on the shower so the floor can get a little wet! I had flowers waiting in the room for my girlfriend, which came out perfect from the conceirge! In the morning, just a phone call away was a commplimentary breakfast-brought straight to the room. Coffee, OJ, and pastries were perfect on a Sunday morning...and I didnt have to get out of bed! Overall a WONDERFUL hotel-with extremely accomodating (and good looking) staff!! Got a construction rate of $235 for a saturday night. Not a sound or look of construction on the weekends!! Would highly recommend!!!"
95,1964,"Feb 8 2009	Sexy Showers at the Standard	Having visited The Standard in Miami, I've been looking forward to seeing what The Standard in NYC would offer in a town full of high-end unique hotels. The hotel is still not complete and won't be for some time, I guess, but do not be afraid to book a room in the meantime. I didn't hear or see any evidence of the construction once inside the building, which is pretty impressive. And the staff does everything it can to make your stay comfortable. I was particularly impressed with the concierge--she actually KNEW the area unlike so many other concierges who take up space behind a desk and merely recommend people to the same 2 restaurants. I was trying to figure out what to do with my afternoon and she knew where I could get a haircut, where the best art gallery was, what the exhibits were like at a small nearby museum, what spas were good, where I should get a drink and where I should get dinner all within the neighborhood and her recommendations were all spot on. Management clearly understands good staffing.That leads me to the best thing about this hotel--its location. This area is my favorite part of NYC. The restaurants and clubs are plentiful and good. And the buildings aren't so high. It's authentic NYC. And to be able to walk back to the hotel after experiencing it all is a plus for me.My room at The Standard was good, although not super unique. But absolutely no complaints. Floor to ceiling windows create the view, a well-appointed and comfortable bed make for a good night of sleeping. As others have mentioned, the shower is separated from the bedroom by floor to ceiling clear glass, which I thought was pretty damn sexy. (Too bad the shower's design seems a little off as water was pouring into the bathroom and into the living room rug. I didn't mind it but I felt bad for the housekeeping staff.) I'll definitely be heading back when it's complete to see what else it has to offer."
96,1964,"Jan 17 2009 	The NY Standard is beyond FABULOUS!	Last night I stayed at the New York Standard - room 9.11 - and it was brilliant. Andre Balasz and his team really know how to put their stamp on things and create an experience that is so special. From the killer mini bar (although it is hardly mini), to the so very well thought out appointments, everything feels hand picked and just works perfectly. The bed was heavenly and the sheets were very high in thread count. The room somehow feels a bit like a cruise ship cabin and as with the other reviews, the views of New York City are by far the best I've ever experienced in a NYC hotel.The staff was incredibly accommodating and attentive...and QUICK! And I can't go on without mentioning how gorgeous the staff is! Wow. The lobby bar is really chic and sexy but is the only lounge open at this time.The hotel is only about half finished but they have made sure that you almost don't notice- they have an awesome variety of menus from restaurant in the area that deliver and the free breakfast delivered to our room within minutes of calling was delicious - scones and croissants and excellent coffee and OJ. I am anxious to see the rest of the space and excited to frequent the top floor 360 degree view bar and restaurant. And they are supposedly building a restaurant and beer garden under the Highline - too cool. Summer cannot come soon enough!I highly recommend The NY Standard - superior service. fantastic rooms. mind blowing views! Book it!"
97,1964,"Jan 4 2009 	Great service Nicely appointed kinks to be worked out	We went for New Year's Eve even though we live in New York as we wanted to see the inside of the hotel, and was closer to where we would be going out for the evening. We stayed in a Superior King. Service was excellent. Champagne on arrival, personally shown to our room. Although, lots of confusion about late check out next morning and staff unclear how to resolve until we spoke with the manager. Room was minimal, and quite lovely. Nice couch, table, platform bed, large TV. Lighting over bed fantastic, rest of lighting in room needed dimmers, too bright (light in common hallway terrible...bright fluorescent orange, why?). Bathroom: open shower a problem, water goes everywhere, including all over curtains which you have to use as you're a bit on display. Bed was super comfy. View amazing."
98,1964,"Jan 1 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Views	Saw initial review on Curbed.com, decided to call and book room for New Years Eve, was going to a NYE event at Tenjune. Awesome rate for NYE $195 for superior queen.Check in was simple, can tell they are still working on the process, as the property has only been open for a few weeks, and is still under construction.Room was located on 8th floor, hallway lighting a little to much for me, a radiant orange glow, not really mood lighting for me but was a different approach.Immediately, when walked into room , awesome view of the hudson and downtown, floor to ceiling windows. Bathroom was to the right (sink, soaking tube and shower), I tripped going into the bathroom, floor raised with glossy black tiles. A little to modern for my taste but unique. Bed faced windows and TV was on a stand directly in front of the bed, and a small sitting area with a table and bench seating across the wall. Again awesome view from bed, but close shade at night, the sun this morning was blinding.One thing about this particular room , do not stay with someone whom you do not intimately, as the shower/bathing area is completely open to the bed area. You can jump into the tub from the bed, as there is just a open frame behind the bed directly into the tub.Only issue I had with my room was the shower, upon showering, the floor was apparently not graded properly and the water was flowing into the common area, when it should have gone down the drain in the floor. I had to use the majority of the towels to soak up the water on the floor in front of the sink. To the hotels credit, we received a $50 credit from the hotel.Forgot to mention the toilet was in a small enclosure (with a door with a mirror) to the left as you walk into the room.Overall, a nice hotel, nice staff, awesome view, and for the cost on a holiday in NYC a great stay.Time will tell when the hotel is &quot;complete&quot; how the Standard do in the city."
99,1964,Aug 28 2009 	magnifico hotel
1,1965,Nov 18 2009	Mary's Going Off to College Bash	Neal Buker etc. We didn't have much of a view but that is a really good way to save money in an expensive hotel in the city. Don't stay on the park side! It was a two bedroom suite ans in1990 it was only like 250.00 per night in a 4 star hotel.
2,1965,"Nov 5 2009 	The standard you would expect but the price.....	It is a very nice hotel....as you would expect from a St Regis. Every amentiy, a butler for your every whim, etc. but it really becomes a question of value. If you are someone who enjoys spending money then stay here--the location is great and the service is terrific....while we enjoyed everything about the hotel I just wonder if we wouldn't have had as good an experience for half the price somewhere else....."
3,1965,"Oct 26 2009 	Honestly? For a St Regis it was very disappointing	I stayed in St Regis halfway through my trip in NYC. My mum &amp; her husband were on an official trip to NYC and since there was an extra room in the Presidential Suite they asked my sis &amp; me to join them.I must say up front that decor-wise, this isn't my style of hotel. I prefer contemporary, tropical, industrial, quirky designs over the gilt gold old classical decor any time, but decor-wise aside, I must admit I was very disappointed with the overall service at the St Regis. Yes, the rooms were large and comfortable, and the beds heavenly. We had a view of Central Park from the living room and that was very cool. The bathroom was also very large but the shower area was quite small and cramped and poorly ventilated, trapping a lot of stifling steam during a hot shower. I didn't spend much time in the living area but the flat screen tv camouflaging as a mirrored frame was a pretty cool idea. I also liked the toiletries in the bathroom and people-watching in the lobby.But aside from the first Butler (Josef) who was very helpful, the rest of them didn't seem to like their jobs very much. One middle-aged lady butler didn't seem to know how to clear up the dining table properly and breakfast we pre-ordered the night before showed up half an hour late (it was also pretty mediocre). My mum woke up the first morning to find coffee and cookies on a tray and she thought they were wonderfully efficient, until she noticed that the cups were all dirty, the pot was empty and it was actually YESTERDAY afternoon's coffee. When she called the Butler all they said was &quot;Oh, you should have called housekeeping&quot; without even apologizing. Considering they make up the room everyday and there should have been a turn down service in the evenings, shouldn't they notice these things? Plus, shouldn't the Butlers come in to check once in awhile instead of waiting to be called? Frankly after the second day, we didn't see a single butler and a broken glass that was there on the FIRST DAY we checked in was still there on the day we checked out! And they didn't replace used dirty glasses with clean ones. If we didn't wash them on our own, we wouldn't have clean glasses at all. Honestly, for the money one pays to stay at the Presidential Suite at the St Regis (or in ANY room at the St Regis for that matter), this shouldn't be the case at all. I was also shocked to find that housekeeping attempted to poorly hide the bedcovers behind the curtains! I really don't know why they didn't just fold it neatly and place it in the almost empty armoir instead. They also seemed to want to get their jobs done in a hurry and kept hovering outside the room and appearing every fifteen minutes even though the do not disturb sign was on and we kept telling them that there was a meeting taking place and to come back later. Other than that, the tv in the bedroom was actually quite small, and wouldn't come out properly from the armoir. You also couldn't turn the aircond or heating on permanently, it was either on AUTO or OFF, and left the room feeling very very warm during the night while we were sleeping. And on the last night, housekeeping didn't even put the drinking water out at all. I was also a bit annoyed with the much too large bathroom rug that was too thick to allow the bathroom door to open without bunching it up. The lift was also kind of small and very rattle. Probably time for an upgrade or serious maintenance. Oh, and if paying that much money for a room wasn't enough, they charge you for internet too! I've paid $165 for a room in NYC before and got free internet even then! Also, there were issues with the key swipe every single night. Even when we went down to get it reset, it still didn't work! We were so exhausted to go down again that thankfully the adjoining room was open and we went into the suite from there.Now if I were paying $100 a night and had to deal with these issues, I would understand, heck, we wouldn't even have a butler in the first place. But I have stayed in cheaper hotels with better service! And like I said earlier, for a St Regis, these issues should not happen at all. And I have been lucky enough to accompany my mum on some trips and even in China the butler always comes in to check to make sure everything is alright and the room gets a full cleaning the minute everyone leaves and is in tip top condition when we get back.That is not to say that everyone in the hotel was a horror though. Some of the concierge were very helpful and one guy even pulled up an extra chair in a lobby for me after he saw me standing for an hour waiting for the rest of the entourage to arrive. Some of the guys out front were also pretty good conducting the arrival of guests, traffic and bags.Other than that, I do think the hotel needs a bit of an upgrade. It could wait a few years or so, but &quot;old&quot; as opposed to &quot;classical&quot; is the first thing that pops into you mind when you step inside.And the fact that the recent reviews I've read here praises the hotel's services makes me doubly disappointed that we did not receive the same service."
4,1965,"Oct 19 2009 	Outstanding	We visit NYC twice a year and always stay at the St Regis. It is incredible. The service is unparallelled; the rooms are large; the bathrooms luxurious....I could go on. Even the workout room is great, albeit small. My only complaint is the bar is overpriced but that's the going rate in the area. Have champagne delivered by the concierge and enjoy it in your fabulous room!"
5,1965,"Oct 15 2009 	I've got a butler!!??!!	We stayed at the St. Regis for 3 nights with our young daughter. I mistakenly booked the htoel for the wrong three days. (I arrived one day early). The professional staff quickly accomodated us with the same rate. We were happily surprised to be greeted at our room by the butler! The room was formal and beautiful. The beds were extraordinarily comfy and my wife said it was like &quot;sleeping in a cloud.&quot; The bath products that were provided were spa quality. My wife used the spa and said it was one of the best spa experiences she had ever had. Room service was quick and delicious. The hotel is centrally located - and right across the street from the Disney store - which was the thrill of my daughter's trip. It wasn't cheap, but well worth the expense."
6,1965,"Oct 8 2009 	Elegant Luxury	We were given an overnight stay at the St. Regis as an anniversary present and were treated to elegant luxury. The accommodations were plush, clean and first class.The location to the theater district was convenient as well as many choices of restaurants.For an overnight in the City, do not hesitate to enjoy the St. Regis."
7,1965,"Oct 8 2009 	Fabulous Accomodations excellent service	I was on a trip looking for sites to hold business meetings in New York City. Everyone at the St. Regis, from the front desk to security to the housekeeping and butlers were friendly, helpful and went out of their way to provide anything I requested. The rooms were spacious (for New York) and quiet and the sheets on the bed were Pratesi. What more could someone ask for? Oh yes, they also provided butler service."
8,1965,"Sep 17 2009 	Best hotel in New York	I've stayed at the St. Regis on several occasions and had a wonderful experience each time. The guest rooms are spacious, quiet, well decorated and functional, with comfortable beds and big marble bathrooms. Public areas are elegant. The staff is cheerful and professional. Room service is prompt and the food is tasty. Ideal location. Overall, a lovely hotel."
9,1965,Sep 3 2009 	CLASSIC NEW YORK !!! FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY	Another one of my favorites. Beautiful hotel and first class service all the way. Great place to have a business meeting as well. The suite are large and classically decorated. I have stayed here many times and have never been disappointed. You cant beat the location. Between 5th Avenue and Madison. The best shopping in the US. Close to central park. I threw a wonderful event there and the staff couldn't be more helpful.
10,1965,"Aug 25 2009 	Great service and grand deco	We booked the St Regis because a colleague has been raving about it, so we had high expectations before the trip. The location and the hotel itself is grand and luxurious, the check-in staff very polite and helpful, even though I am surprised by the small size of the lobby, and the almost non-existence of the doorman (when we checked out, I overhead one customer complained that he's been waiting for 20 mins for someone to take out his luggage from his limo, we didn't have such problem as we took the luggage into the hotel ourselves!). Although this is a minor problem, IMO.The room itself is of good size (esp for New York) and nicely decorated, but if you're into more chic and modern deco, this is not it, it's all old school glamour. The bathroom is the best part of the room - very luxurious and spacious, marble everywhere. The bed is comfy. The much talked about Butler service is OK, he/she (not fixed) would bring tea/coffee for you, iron your clothes and shine your shoes etc. However, I find all these &quot;personal contact&quot; a bit tiring and to be honest - just another excuse for tipping... It's definitely a great hotel, but I am not sure if all these warrant the kind of price they are charging. If you are paying $700-1000 a night, there are other better options, I believe."
11,1965,"Aug 7 2009 	Fantastic Service but a bit tired.	The St. Regis is quite pretty, if you are my grandmother.. while the maxfield parish paintings are cool, but the whole place just made me feel old and tired - in terms of vibe/look/feel. However the SERVICE was phenomenal - the staff lovely, kind and courteous. The personal butler was great, and Sophie in the spa gives some of the best massages I've ever had in NY."
12,1965,"Aug 7 2009 	Could have been better...	I just got back from a quick trip to NY with my mother and a friend to celebrate her 60th b-day. We decided to use some points and stay at the St. Regis after we found that all the other starwood hotels were booked for the three nights (4-5-6-7) From all the great reviews about the St. Regis, I was excited! Here's the lowdown:The Good: 1) Location (if you want to do mega shopping aka. chanel, LV and if you want to see big touristy places like the empire and rockafeller)-which we did none of bc this is my millionth trip to ny.2) The butlers. These people were SO very nice and attentive. They would bend over backward if you asked, and they all had amazingly funny, friendly personalities-yet never intruded, or pressed for money. We had Hong, Albert, Adelberto and two other men. 3) The beds! We stayed in the largest of the Grand Luxe rooms and the beds were great. Super plush and clean....somewhat small thought for a double in American standards(could only fit one person).4) The bathrooms. If I could have brought this home, I would have! Pretty large for Manhattan standards, marble everything, Lcd and phone and a &quot;rainforest&quot; like shower with amazing water pressure. The bath products from their spa work incredibly well, too!5) We did not hear one thing our entire stay. No other guests, just the ringing of our doorbell as the butler came to bring things. Very peaceful and calming.The Bad1) We had to change rooms because there was not enough space for three adult people. We reserved a grand luxe (all they had) with two double beds. We asked for an upgrade but they said they were all sold out. When we got into the room, the beds were much smaller than standard US sized doubles, and only could comfortably fit one adult. They did offer a roll away free of charge each night for the confusion.2) Awful reception (both internet and cell phone). My mother has verizon and our friend has At&amp;t. Verizon got NO service, and at&amp;t got light service. So annoying.3) Service in general in the lobby as a bit poorer than expected for that class of hotel. Doormen were only stationed at one entrance, bell men were spotty and sometimes not available and we took our own bags from our room to the lobby when leaving.The feel of the hotel was a bit snobby. Many guests were dripping with designer products, in and out of luxury cars and no one EVER smiled or said hello! I didn't get it. There was virtually no lobby (probably to deter people from the streets to come in to use the bathroom). The whole hotel had a heavy european influence with a lot of gold and and chandeliers. Not my personal taste, but for some I bet this was luxurious.One amazing thing the St Regis did do, was order a cake for our friend to be brought to our room after dinner. I gave our butler little notice, maybe 4 hours, and when he brought it up, he said that the hotel had to send away for it because they had no cakes on hand to my specification. So nice! Obv. it cost an arm and leg, but well worth it.Overall, I would not choose to stay here again. I prefer the lower east side, greenwich Village and battery park to midtown bc midtown is so very touristy, but it was definitly NOT awful. One word of advice, don't order food from the hotel room service! A child size hamburger without any sides at all or drink cost $30 oops!Happy travels!"
13,1965,"Jul 25 2009 	Now I'm Spoiled	I had the pleasure of experiencing the high level of service and attention to detail during my stay at the St Regis. I was lucky to stay on the concierge level which included a butler. WOW!! We were initially greeted by our butler, then escorted to our room which had a fresh fruit and water waiting for us. Perfect after being out in the city all day. The bathroom was beautiful and the television in the bathroom was a nice touch. We took advantage of the courtesy car to take us to our dinner destination, Whym. We had breakfast downstairs and again service and food was top notch. What a great experience."
14,1965,"Jul 14 2009 	Makes you feel very special!	I had some spare SPG points to use and wanted to spend a few days in NYC. My head said stay at the cool and funky 'W', but for some reason I was attracted to the potentially stuffy St Regis. Well, that was one good decision...The entrance is unassuming. Inside you are immediately at peace, protected from the noisy and rush of the city. The hall staff are helpful and engaging (even to an SPG guest!) The check-in staff escorted me in the lift to my floor. There I was greeted by my concierge who offered to unpack and press my clothes. I declined, so instead he trotted off and brought me a superb tray of tea and biscuits. I felt like a proper Englishman in New York!The room was traditionally decorated to a very high standard - the bed was extremely comfortable and had luxurious fabrics. The bathroom was a treat - at first sight, it looked rather 20's retro, but the function was truly contemporary, with a fabulously powerful shower cubicle. The bath products were my personal favourite, Acqua di Parma - always a good choice to suit both men and women.The good service continued for the length of my stay and I was really quite sad to leave to return to the UK. Definitely on my 'must return' list and would be my top pick next time I go back to NTC."
15,1965,"Jul 3 2009 	The best in New York	Whenever I have stayed here, I leave convinced it's the best hotel in New York, the service is amazing, the turn of the century details excellent, the furnighings are great and the maid and butler service are outstanding. I"
16,1965,"May 24 2009 	Great old hotel perfect for vacation or business !	But I was in NY last week and stayed at the St. Regis Hotel off 5th Ave and I have to give it up the St. Regis!!! It's no new, but it's still amazing and ultra-fab. And they are now offering prix fix lunch and dinner. Both are amazing deals for NYC. I had Risotto, Lobster Salad + dessert for $45.00 for lunch. The prix fix dinner is now $60.00. And I had my own private butler who bought me coffee in the am and pressed by Business Dress for me for my morning meeting.You might want to take a new look at this old hotel. It's still the grand lady of NYC luxury. The St. Regis is the NIRVANA of NY TRAVEL!!"
17,1965,"May 22 2009 	Best hotel in NYC	Without any doubts this is the best hotel in New York City. The service is outstanding, from the porters to the personal butler that will accomodate to every request. The rooms are luxurious, the location fantastic. Highly recommended."
18,1965,"May 20 2009 	Favorite Hotel in NYC	We visit New York frequently, at least twice a year and every time we chose the St. Regis Hotel for our luxury long weekend. With a location that cannot be beat (except of course for the Peninsula right across the street), the St. Regis offers a location at 55th Street East and 5th Avenue. From the moment you enter the lobby, it is like being transformed into a whole new world of old world charm and luxury. The rooms or suites (we have had both) are extremely spacious and have recently been re-done. The butler service is naturally St Regis and are extremely helpful in securing theatre tickets or restaurant reservations. The restaurants in the St Regis are wonderful already though, Alain Ducasse is a wonderful experience for a nice dinner and the Astor Court for afternoon tea or breakfast is the best place in the city. There are several nice restaurants within walking distance of the hotel also. The Remede Spa is fantastic, the treatments are customized for you (by your therapist) and a 60 minute massage is heaven. We will always continue to return to this fine establishment."
19,1965,"May 12 2009 	Ultimate Luxury	We stayed at The St. Regis New York from the 2nd May for 3 nights. It was our first time visit to the Hotel and New York. There was no draw back staying here. The fact is that it completely spoils you from staying anywhere else. It has a perfect position at 5th Avenue 55th Street which allows you to be out of the hussel and bussel , but within walking distance to central park and shopping centre. The hotel itself is beautiful, very classy and luxurious. The bedrooms are sumptuious with almost every amenity. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room but you get free coffee and tea from your butler at arrival and with wake up calls. From the crisp white bedlinen, to the gorgeous marble bathrooms,it is literally a dream to stay here. On this, our first visit, there was a complimentry canapes in our room in the evening. the St. Regis certainly go out of their way to make you feel special . My butler helpful enough to prepare my bath, so after a long soak in the deepest bath ever I recovered from my long flight.I defy anyone not to like The St. Regis New York, its one of the most famous , luxurious hotels in the world, whats not to like...........!"
20,1965,Apr 30 2009 	My own butler need I say more...	This is the second time I have stayed at the St. Regis Hotel in Ny. The personal service is always the best. I was staying at the Cooper Square Hotel in Noho for a few days prior to the St. Regis due to my friends party. I wanted to try out Peter Luger's but the concierge there couldn't get me in. So I figured try the St. Regis and they did manage to get me a reservation even though I was staying at another hotel. They also recommended a resturant called Blue Hill and made us a reservation which I noted was most likely very coveted. The place was packed with people waiting. The food was to die for!! Standing ovation to the concierge at the St. Regis!! They even charged up my cell phone for me at 5am when I needed it. My butler Marcus at the St. Regis was sooo nice. It's the little things to me that make for a memorable trip.
21,1965,Mar 23 2009 	Elegant Hotel	The St. Regis has a wonderful location. The room was decorated by a good decorator as it was understated and soothing. Great bed. The service is very much at your command and there is more than ample staff. The resturant was good and we had tea one day and lunch another. The famous King Cole Bar we sat in one night and a drink was $45. This is not an inexpensive hotel. They do have a car that will take you places within 10 blocks.
22,1965,"Mar 22 2009 	Sets the Standard	I've stayed in six St. Regis hotels....US and Asia...and the New York original definitely sets the standard. You've read the other reviews...outstanding service, rooms, location, etc. What always surprises me is the easy friendliness of the staff. I always expect a New York City arrogant condescension. (Perhaps I anticipate a visit to Rosings and treatment from Lady Catherine de Burgh.) Just the opposite. The staff makes the hotel feel like home...relaxing instead of stiff. Just wish I could afford to stay there more often. Quite an amazing place. (Now, if some of the other St. Regis hotels would just start living up to this standard!)Oh, yes. Don't miss ordering a room service breakfast. That's how it should be done!"
23,1965,"Mar 6 2009 	Absolutely Perfect. Why stay anywhere else in New York?	Stayed 4 nights beginning of March during the snow storm and could not possibly be any happier. Service was ridiculously good, starting with the doormen in top hats and tails, all the way through to our butler. I love the small yet gorgeous lobby as its size pretty much discourages other tourists from walking around and hanging out in it as they tend to do at the Plaza or Waldorf. Somehow, the doormen knew my name when I pulled up at the hotel the first time, must have been the last guest to check-in I guess. Check-in itself is very quick and when I gave the girl my Starwood number, she instantly offered me an upgrade to a suite, even though I probably have 4 Starwood stays over the last 2 years. That was nice. Was taken to the room by the same girl who was explaining the layout on the ride up to the 18th floor. We were met there by the butler who offered to press 2 garments from each of us gratis and complimentary shoe-shine and coffe/tea.First class place.The bathroom products are from the Remede spa downstairs and are probably as good as you can get in a hotel bathroom. I'll admit, I kept one of everything each day. The bed was insanely comfortable with real down comforters and pillows. All you have to do is ask if you want some nice memory foam pillows as well. Turndown service includes a fresh bucket of ice, 2 robes, 2 sets of surprisingly comfortable slippers, fresh fruit, curtains pulled, lights dimmed, and nice classical music set.You must take advantage of the complimentary tea service in the mornings. Bone china served on a silver tray, delivered with 3 newspapers. I LOVED the honey flavored swizzle sticks they send along instead of sugar. Seriously nice touch.We were treated as if we were hedge fund execs who stay there all the time, even though I secured the room when lastminutetravel.com had their $1 hotel room sale. I was expecting indifferent service from them to be honest, seeing as I paid $4 total, but they all couldn't have been nicer.Location is A+ perfect. Tiffany, central park, Bergdorff, St. Patrick's, subway, all within 2 or 3 blocks. Great place on the SW corner of the block with freshly made bagels and a stunning fruit/salad bar. Getting a taste for this place has ruined me. I won't stay anywhere else in NY again."
24,1965,"Feb 4 2009 	Fabulous	We stayed in the St Regis for 2 nights during a weekend. The reception in the hotel was as expected from a hotel of this class; the doorman asked our name upon arrival and we were greeted by our name whenever we left or came in. The check-in was pleasant, we received an upgrade to a suite and, surprisingly, we were brought to our room by the person who checked us in. Shortly thereafter the butler arrived to explain the mechanics in the room and she immedialty checked whether we needed dinner reservations (which she obtained at Adour, in the hotel for that evening). Throughout our stay the service was excellent. The room was classicaly decorated, very comfortable and spacious. Coffee and tea service was complimentary and apeeared shortly after calling the butler.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but had dinner in Adour (Alain Ducasse) which was excellent, both service and food, but what else do you expect when the chef has several Michelin star restaurants.On our second day we asked the doorman for a taxi to the restaurant we had a reservation for, but instead of hailing a cab he called the St Regis Bentley for us; a very pleasant surprise.The hotel is very conveniently located between 5th Avenue (corner) and Madison Avenua and 3 blocks from Central Park.We have stayed in several other hotels in NYC, and althougfh there are many other cheaper and great alterantives, this was by far our best experience and highly recommended for a special event."
25,1965,"Jan 30 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	This is a beautiful Hotel. This is the most like a European style luxury hotel in the US..and we have been to a few. The houskeeping service was seamless and attentive to every detail. Everything about our room and bath was luxury.We have and will go back. Our only complaint is a big one. The food and service in the Astor Court dining room for breakfast was sub standard. The omelettes were tasteless. The coffee was weak. And for such pedestrian fare the prices were extraordinarily high ($133). When we entered the dining room at 10AM, almost all the tables had dirty dishes on them. We were not alone in our dissatisfaction. The table next to us waited for 30 minutes for a bowl of oatmeal."
26,1965,Jan 26 2009 	Classic though a little old	Service is king here though I prefer a more casual style. Great location. Butlers really look after you which sometimes I need in New York.
27,1965,"Nov 24 2008 	Never had better service	I've stayed at the St. Regis San Francisco and never thought I would experience better service but the St. Regis NYC has certainly done just that. I arrived on a redeye from Los Angeles and showed up at the hotel at 6:45am. They took my cell phone number and said they would try to ready a room for me within the next several hours. The hotel called me before 10am and said they had a room ready for me. They upgraded me to a deluxe room #1411 (not sure if being a SPG gold member had anything to do with it). I was staying only for 1 night and I booked the room using SPG points. The room was very spacious for a Manhattan hotel. The butler service was amazing -- brought me unlimited bottles of water and of took my shoes for a shining and brought them back within an hour. Even thought my room faced 55th street, it was unbelieveably quiet for a Manhattan hotel. I had a wonderful stay. The location on 5th avenue is perfect. The hotel also gave me a 4pm late checkout the next day. Everyone from the bell desk to the folks working at the front desk are incredibly nice and bend over backwards to ensure your stay is perfect. If you can afford it, I feel that there is not other place to stay in Manhattan."
28,1965,"Nov 22 2008 	Excellent but old-fashioned	Looking at its website before arriving, I was worried about not liking the St Regis. In general, I do not like classical-style hotels in the US, but the excellent service and very comfortable rooms won me over. The St Regis is an exceptionally well-run hotel with fantastic staff in a perfect New York location. For this style of hotel in NY, I still prefer the Peninsula but it is a very close race.Right from the moment I arrived, everyone was unfailingly friendly and polite: nothing was too much trouble, and every single person who met me greeted me with a cheerful smile. The butler service was much more practical and useful than other hotels I have stayed at: the butler was very friendly and seemed to take a great personal pride in sorting out whatever you requested. Room service breakfast was excellent, and good value compared to other NY five star places.The rooms themselves do the very best they can around the old bones of the hotel. They are decorated in a clean, classical style--my Astor Suite was in a muted yellow with silk wall panels, while my colleague's Grand Luxe room was in a light duck egg blue. Both were good sizes and well laid out, with classical marble bathrooms that are a good size and well-equipped. The Astor Suite suffered from the very small windows you get on the top floors of the building, but in return for that the views were good. For me, given the hotel's short height and location, none of the views are spectacular: just nice views up and down the grand streets. The Grand Luxe room was much brighter, but you only really saw the fronts of other buildings from the windows.All the facilities worked excellently, as expected at this level. Good high-speed internet and excellent climate control in both rooms. Given this and the fact that all services are 24h, it makes a great hotel for business travellers as well as a luxurious place for a holiday. Value-wise it's very expensive but on a par with the other five star places in NY.I only stayed for one night but I definitely want to go back and try the place again."
29,1965,"Nov 16 2008 	Another Wonderful Stay...	We enjoyed a 3 night stay at the St Regis Hotel earlier this month. This is our annual fall trip to NYC. Once again the hotel staff were wonderful and every single request was handled promptly and with no issues...I stayed with my wife and 2 little boys in a 1 bedroom suite that was just lovely, roomy, and luxurious. This time around we found the butler helpful and will to address our every need. The restaurant, though a bit on the expensive side, was excellent. The food was wonderful and the service was excellent. Is the St Regis expensive?.....YES!!..even by NYC standards...is it worth it?...absolutely!Unless we get priced out...we will always return to the St Regis every fall."
30,1965,"Nov 10 2008 	Such a great weekend...	We stayed at the St Regis this weekend on our starwood points. It was WONDERFUL. We requested either ajoining rooms or side by side rooms, since we were traveling with our three children. We were more than please to find rooms ajoined in a suite. The rooms were beautiful, butler service was excellent, and beds are soooo cozy. King Cole bar downstairs was also a lot of fun. Hotel is in a perfect location. We travel to NYC often and usually stay at the Four Seasons, but I think we will only stay at the St Regis now!!!"
31,1965,"Nov 2 2008 	Amazing Rooms Amazing Butlers	The St. Regis is a six-star experience on Fifth Avenue. The rooms are truly luxurious, with virtually every possible amenity. The butler service is truly out of this world. You almost need to be thinking of the help you need before you arrive. The St. Regis is, in short, the polar opposite of the Marriott-mass-hotel experience in the United States. This is old world charm combined with outstanding service.This is Northern efficiency with Southern charm. You won't believe that you are in New York City, until you hit the sidewalk. The hotel's location is terrific. You are nearby to Central Park, the Apple Store, Bergdorf's, etc. I don't have many six star hotels. This is one of them."
32,1965,"Oct 24 2008	EleganceStyle Comfort and more	We spent two nights here in July.Having phoned prior,the concierge had confirmation of restaurant bookings waiting in our room.We had a butler and she was amazing.I needed my suit pressed in a hurry after a long day travelling and she had it back to me in 30 minutes!The rooms are Grand in a European (think Paris) style and just so neat.The room daily service was great as was turn down with plenty of water left out and fresh fruit.I highly recommend their special recipe french toast for breakfast , it's unusual and very very tasty!"
33,1965,"Oct 20 2008 	Beautiful Hotel	This hotel is a standout, from the luxurious common areas, to the beautifully decorated French neoclassical rooms. We stayed in a Grand Luxe room which included a couch and living area and a plasma t.v. that would pop up from the foot of the bed by remote control. It swiveled around so that we could watch t.v. either from the living area or the bed. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and a shower, as well as a dual vanity. The butler would bring in fresh fruit every day and upon request delivered complimentary coffee and tea in the morning hours. Each floor has it's own butler, so there is never much of a wait. The hotel is in an excellent location, right near Park and Fifth Ave.. Designer shopping is around the corner and Central Park is within walking distance. It was exciting to see the thriving city of New York from one of the best parts of downtown Manhattan. The rooms were always very clean and the staff would leave them a bit perfumed after servicing them each day. The service in this hotel was excellent and unobtrusive. Each request was granted quickly and efficiently.I wanted to give this hotel the five stars it should deserve but gave it four for the following reasons. First of all, the room had no light. It was always dark, even during the day. The only rooms with light were on the top floor. Second, except for the new restaurant by Alan Ducaisse, the food was only average and that includes in room dining and at their restaurant near the lobby. Third, the spa, while having good actual massage treatments, had no real waiting area. In the hallway that leads to the treatment rooms, two chairs are set up for people waiting for their massages. You can't make any noise because the people receiving their massages are in doors right behind you. Two other people came for their massage while we were there and there was no room for them to wait anywhere. The last problem had to do with the noise, which really wasn't the fault of the St. Regis. Every night we were there, a heavy garbage truck screeched through the streets of Manhattan to pick up some type of garbage. On Monday night, it was regular garbage, on Tuesday, it was recyclables, Wednesday it was organic materials. They would operate between 12:00 midnight and 2:15 a.m., which made it very difficult to sleep. I think this is just part of being in Manhattan.Other than these problems, this hotel is exceptional, especially in beauty and service. I would not let any of the problems I mentioned stop me from staying here again. -Except that I might try to get a room on a higher floor!"
34,1965,"Oct 4 2008	Loved the St. Regis	Great stay! Impeccable service. Our room was very spacious although it did not have a view. However, we enjoyed the peace and quiet. The bathroom was beautiful with separate shower / toilet / tub areas. Worth every penny (and not a bad deal with the 50% off from Starpoints). The butler on each floor is a nice touch and we enjoyed the truly fresh fruit. Would stay there again. Good location, would recommend."
35,1965,"Sep 13 2008 	What a treat!	We stayed at this hotel for five nights using Starwood Points and used it as our base to attend the U.S. Open tennis matches. Service was superb and the room, complete with a large, swiveling, LCD TV concealed in a pop-up box at the end of the bed, was exquisite. Since we arrived just after lunch, our room was not quite ready. One of the managers walked us into the bar and offered us complimentary drinks while we waited. They came for us about 20 minutes later and escorted us to our room and to meet our floor's butler. She was delightful, offered to unpack our suitcases for us (really, now?!), offered to press any items of clothes for us, and explained how we could page her in the mornings for coffee. Complimentary coffee is brought in the mornings on a silver tray, with china cups, served very hot in a French press. (At night, however, the same request results in a room service charge.) It sure beats making coffee in a dinky pot in the bathroom! Of all of the hotels we've stayed at in the United States and Europe, this ranks among the best."
36,1965,"Sep 9 2008 	Disappointing	I recently stayed at the St Regis and for a hotel of it's status wasn't overly impressed.The good points -The room was spacious and had a nice bathroom with double sinks and a walk-in shower.The bad points -The floor smelt of stale smoke - and this was supposedly a non smoking floor.The breakfast was disgusting, with service that veered from disinterested to rude.I asked for eggs well done - they came barely cooked. I sent it back, and it came back - slightly better but still soft.Perhaps its an American thing, but ordering a full cooked breakfast, and you have to choose sausage OR bacon? Room service - an experience! When ordering items from the menu, we asked for items, lets call them A, B and C.They confirmed the order verbally as items A, C, F, We said no, we want A, B and C. They said B, C and D? Again we repeated the order. The read it back. And delivered the wrong things. By this time we were resigned to the St. Regis doing what it wanted, not what the guest wanted. The food arrived and was intensely salty. Staff kept calling the second guest my name, and were completely unable to grasp that we were two different people with two different surnames. For a hotel that charges on average $1000 per night, this is completely awful, and I simply would urge people to carefully consider what they need from a hotel.No one in the hotel, with the exception of one or two people actually LISTEN to what you are asking, and this seems to be a trait peculiar to New York. Despite its grandeur, and the obvious efforts of some of the staff to go a bit further, this hotel is by no means as good as it thinks it is."
37,1965,"Sep 6 2008	hotel with attention to detail	i stayed in this hotel 2 nights for business because i had to be close to 5th avenue. wonderful stay. the room was great. the decoration very relaxing. comfortable high bed. the butlers were excellent and very nice. michael i think his name is very friendly. the attention for detail is wonderful. the only less nice thing is the doormans had problems with caring with cars and taxis. but in general, my stay was wonderful. there restaurant adour was amazing. i ate at alain ducasse restaurant louis XV in monaco and wanted to try his in new york. beautiful. delicious. i got the service i payed for. please keep the good job going."
38,1965,"Sep 6 2008 	adooooored our stay	Stayed 3 nights with 2 kids 5 and 8. We felt so welcome by the warm staff (butler, concierge, groom, waiter...) we cannot wait to return. We used to stay at the Four Seasons but fell so anonymous last time we wanted a change. Well, we were right : Everybody greeted us in a very personal way and all seemed to remember our names and our children's. Had a great suite with 2 bathrooms and great views. Well, everything was so perfect, we are dreaming to come back from Paris ! The St Regis definitly lives up to its reputation..."
39,1965,"Aug 31 2008	Just OK	Just returned from a weekend at the St. Regis in NYC. I was not overly impressed by the hotel. The first night we checked in we were given a room on a lower floor - with absolutely no view (except for an exterior wall). We were moved the second night, but our room was only half the size. The butler service was a nice touch, except when we tried to utilize the service, the butler did not respond until 20 minutes later. We did enjoy the bed and linens - they were nice. I was disappointed that some of the other aspects of the hotel were not up to par...such as the very low water pressure, broken hairdryer, smoking-smell on the non-smoking floors...In summary, this was still a nice hotel in a good location (close to 5th Avenue shopping &amp; Central Park)...but for the price, I would definitely stay somewhere else next time."
40,1965,"Aug 25 2008	Fantasic!	Went with friends to look at universities and shopping! Also saw Mary Poppins which was unbelievable! The location is great at 55 and 5 ave. The suite with connecting room was huge and new! The service was the best in new york for dining, theatre, and transportation. The Astor Court serves a fabulous afternoon tea, best in NY and the Alain Ducasse restaurant is perfect for the fine dinner!"
41,1965,"Aug 1 2008	5 Star all the way	We go to NYC frequently and rotate between the Ritz by the Park and the St. Regis. Both are thumbs up from me. The St Regis is more pricey but classical elegance at it's finest. The Astor Court serves a great tea, the Bar is cool and the Alain Ducasse restaurant is great fine dining. The location is great between Madison and Fifth Avenue. You can walk to Barneys, Saks, Bergdorfs and Rockefeller Centre!!! The rooms are spacious and the best staff in NYC!"
42,1965,"Jun 27 2008 	A Palace in NYC	I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I recently booked it for 1 special night, as I was proposing to my girlfriend. I live in NY and had considered the other great hotels (The Ritz, The Mandarin), but I couldn't have been more pleased that I chose this hotel for our special stay. I booked a Grand Luxe room, but when I told the front desk host my plans, she immediately upgraded us to an enormous Madison Suite on the 18th floor. We were amazed by the beauty and sheer size of the room, with an enormous living room, fireplace, and 2 full-size marble bathrooms. They even arranged rose petals in the room for us. I did have a couple of service requests throughout our stay, and after I paged our butler through the in-room control center, my requests were quickly met. The next morning we decided to order breakfast, even though it was incredibly pricey. When we checked out with the same front desk host who checked us in the day before, she ended up comping the pricey breakfast, for no other reason than to congratulate us! I can't say enough nice things about this hotel and the service staff, and I know that my fiance and I will return here for many special occasions in the future."
43,1965,Jun 20 2008 	Exceeded all expectations	Booked two nights at the St. Regis for my wife's birthday midweek using Starwood points. Arrived to find I was upgraded to a Madison Suite with two full baths and 875 square feet total including views of 5th and 55th streets. Received complimentary Champagne and sweets. Also got requested 3P.M. late checkout. If you can find fault with this hotel you need to get a life!
44,1965,"Jun 15 2008 	Absolute Luxury	It was our 10th wedding Anniversary and I wanted to do something special for my beautiful wife so I booked a room at the St. Regis for one night on the Friday of Memorial Day weekend. I booked the Astor Suite for our stay. I also booked a custom massage for my wife and myself. The Concierge was able to get us a dinner reservation at Daniel and everything was in place for a wonderful trip. We drove in from Connecticut and arrived at the St. Regis at 12:15 p.m.. We took advantage of the valet parking and our bags were taken care of smartly by the very professional doormen working the sidewalk. We we're greeted very warmly and we followed the porter inside to the magnificent lobby. We proceeded to guest registration to check-in. I was greeted warmly by the woman checking us in and she told us because of our early arrival, our room was still occupied. However, she said she had a very nice room for us, a very, very, nice room. She handed me the key cards to our room and we were shown around the hotel by a very charming young woman. We were then taken to the elevator and we proceeded to the 18th floor. We got off the elevator went through the french doors, turned left and proceeded to the end of the hall and there was our room. Room 1803 is also known as the Imperial Suite and we were led inside by our butler. The Imperial Suite was gorgeous. You walk into a marble floored foyer with fresh flowers in a vase on the table. We turned left and proceeded to a beautiful bedroom with french antiques and crystal chandalier over the bed. The marble master bathroom was exquisite and spacious. On the other side of the foyer was the living room with two large circular windows. The oval window looked out to the west on 5th Avenue and the Peninsula Hotel across the Avenue. The other round window faced north with a breathtaking view up 5th Avenue with the trees of Central Park verdant in the distance. Next to the living room was an elegant dining room with a six foot round mahogany table surrounded by six elegant chairs. Off the dining room was a full kitchen with granite countertops. Beyond the dining room was a rich paneled study in the most handsome, masculine wood with a beautiful wood desk and chair. The Imperial Suite also had a total of two and one half baths, four flat screen TVs, crystal chandaliers in every room and luxurious empire furniture. I kidded my wife that I felt like french royalty in this fabulous suite. I could have sat on the padded window seat looking out over Central Park for hours. We left and walked over to MoMA. After about three hours at MoMA, we returned and dressed in only our slippers and robes went down to the Spa and were treated royally with our massages. My masseuse was wonderful. My wife reported that her masseur was also fantastic. We returned to our suite and I decided to take a bath. It was a perfect compliment to the massage. I was totally relaxed. We got dressed for dinner and the doorman hailed us a cab and we were whisked away to Daniel for dinner. What a fabulous restaurant. The food, the presentation and the service were all incredible. After dinner, we decided to walk back to the hotel since it wasn't that far and it was a beautiful spring evening in the city. We returned to the St. Regis and walked into the King Cole Bar for a drink. After a round of Red Snappers and catching up with my cousin the artist and musician who met us there, I told my cousin that he had to see our room. He had been to many 5 star hotels throughout Europe and he said he had never seen such a great suite. After he left, my wife and I sat on the padded window seat and took in the city from our big round window. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud and our bedroom was quiet and peaceful. We awoke the next morning and unfortunately had to check out. What a fabulous experience. We will never forget our stay at the St. Regis"
45,1965,"Jun 13 2008	Glad I experienced it; would choose a different hotel next time	My husband booked this hotel for my birthday (a special one); he knew I wanted to experience the hotel at some point in my life. He tried to book a suite but was told that there were none available but not to worry---the room would be the best of the rest. He also wanted tickets to South Pacific and was told that the seats, though terribly expensive, would be the best in the house. He also asked to book a private boat for a Sunday morning Hudson River ride...When we arrived, the greetings and help from the doormen and front desk staff just weren't what we expected from this class of hotel. (I had just stayed at the Ritz Central Park South the month before, where the service was absolutely 5 star, and I could see the difference immediately). The room the butler brought us to faced a wall. We asked for another, and they offered a far better room, but at that point, I was wishing we had booked the Ritz. As we vacillated, the butler said the Madison Suite would be available in a few hours if we wanted to wait. So we did.The Madison Suite was spacious, with a foyer, separate living room, and two baths. It was spotless and really quite lovely with all the old architectural details. No complaints at all. Maid service during the day was excellent; the room was always pristine when we returned. (At night, they always missed at least one thing..we stayed 3 nights total.)When we picked up the tickets for the show, they were *not* the best seats in the house. They were in the loge, not in the orchestra. My husband said no to them, which caused a bit of fluster. Ten minutes later, someone called the room saying there had been a mixup and the seats were now 500 dollars less, far more acceptable. So in the end, we experienced the show and loved it, but this is the kind of thing that adds up to a disappointing hotel experience overall...Also, no one ever followed up on the boat trip. Similarly, everyday service was always polite and friendly but spotty. Sometimes someone would be at the door, greeting you and pushing it open, other times you would have to wrestle with it (it's heavy) yourself. Sometimes someone would be at the elevator to ask you which floor; most of the time, not.It *was* nice to stay in a place with such history, built the way nothing is built nowadays, and I'm really glad I did, but I wouldn't stay here again. In that location, and for that price point, the service at the Ritz was far superior."
46,1965,"Jun 10 2008 	Loved it	The grandour of the hotel,the welcoming hospitality and the spotless and helpfulness of the staff from manager to doorman, well trained well managed. We want to live there for good.Everything, everyone at the St Regis is perfect in every way. We did not want to leave. Its a place we would live to visit and would recommed again and again."
47,1965,"Feb 9 2008	5 star St. Regis	We had a wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel. We arrived early and we were allowed to check in to a room that met all of my request. We only encountered one problem with the heat and it was rectified almost immediately once my husband spoke to the reservation staff. The next day, a box of french chocolates arrived with an invitation to enjoy a complementary breakfast. Needless to say we enjoyed both gifts. Looking forward to our next stay at the truly 5 star hotel with a 5 star staff."
48,1965,"Feb 7 2008 	Very Noisy Street doesn't make up for the comfort	While this hotel is luxurious, I just spent my second night on the fourth floor and was woken up at two by garbage trucks outside which loaded and beeped for an hour. My colleague got bumped up to a suite when she complained about her room. Avoid any rooms on low floors facing the street and you might get some sleep."
49,1965,"Feb 6 2008 	Another great stay at the NY St. Regis	We have stayed at the NY St. Regis 3 times in the last year and have been very impressed with their consistent delivery of 5 star service and rooms. The rooms are beautiful and a great location along with personalized service from the friendly, helpful staff make it our favorite place to stay."
50,1965,"Jan 31 2008 	Location and history	I can only concur with many other reviewers. A landmark hotel that is more than the sum of its parts. If you prefer &quot;bling&quot; then the Peninsula might suit better. The staff were very welcoming and I had the impression many had been working at the hotel for years. We felt at surprisingly at home here, despite the non-existant view from the room. An evening aperitif in the intimate, yet rather grand bar gave evenings a sense of occasion. Will return."
51,1965,"Jan 31 2008 	Recommendation Depends on What You Are Looking For	First the pluses: The St. Regis is well located on Fifth Avenue near Tiffany's and other high end shops. It is a very short walk to Central Park and a five minute walk to Rockefeller Plaza. The beds are comfortable, the room size is quite good and it is a Grande Dame New York hotel property.Now for the the mediocre to minuses:Our two rooms looked out onto brick walls. One room had very little natural light and the other had virtually no natural light at any time of day. When booking the room, I noted to the St. Regis reservation clerk that I had seen an advisory on Trip Advisor that some rooms looked out on brick walls with no natural light. As this trip was a gift to my parents I told the agent that it was important to me that their room, at least, had some kind of view. I was assured that at $1,100.00 per night per room (and as a Starwood Preferred Guest) I was getting superior rooms with some sort of view. It was disappointing for me when that did not happen although some may not be concerned by that.Also, the service was only &quot;good&quot; and not the &quot;excellent&quot; I would expect paying the rack rate of $1,100.00 per night. For example, The St. Regis prides themselves on providing butler service. Personally (and this is another case where personal judgement comes in), I did not find having a butler terribly useful. For me they really just became someone else to tip (and the expected tip, as a per cent of room rate, was high). Our butler was polite but essentially just showed us around the room as a bus boy normally would do. They did offer to serve coffee or tea in the morning as part of our wake up call which is a nice idea. However, as I was travelling with my young daughter I asked if she could have a hot chocolate instead. The butler advised that I would have to make that arrangement through room service at a charge of something in excess of $10.00. At $1,100.00 per night, I think the hotel could have been flexible enough to offer hot chocolate for the wake up call. However, I will leave that up to the reader to decide. For me it was a niggly item that at this price point should not happen. Also, our room rate included a bowl of fresh fruit but on arrival we only had an empty bowl. Not a big problem especially since the butler said the bowl would be filled right away. However, it ended up taking two reminder calls and, even at that, the fruit did not arrive until the next afternoon. Again, just a niggly but one I don't expect at that price point. Butlers will also do a complimentary shoe shine overnight, and will iron up to two garments per day gratis. We did not need those services so there was not advantage to us there, but I recognize others may find that service useful (although with or without butlers most hotels at this price point offer at least the complimentary shoe shine and the expected butler tip at the end of the trip would have more than covered the cost of having a garment or two ironed).Finally, the food at the hotel is mediocre and, with the exception of the bar which has a beautiful mural that is worth taking a look at, the central restaurant suffers from poor lighting and an overall bland feel. To those choosing to stay at the hotel I would recommend eating meals elsewhere (even the highly touted afternoon tea was uninspired). Thanks to the great location there is a variety of very good restaurants and eateries including several that offer high tea.So there you have it. I have nothing terrible to say, it was just below expectations. On my next visit to New York, I will seek a hotel in the same locale but will forego the butler in favour of a room with a view and natural light."
52,1965,"Dec 12 2007 	You have to love the St. Regis	The St. Regis truly sets the standard for hotel stays in New York City. Even the Ritz Carlton feels like a significant step down after staying here. Although it is very expensive, the hotel really does deliver with service that goes beyond the offerings of other luxury hotels. First, the rooms themselves always seem quite a bit larger than others I have stayed in in Manhattan. They tend to be decorated in a more opulent Victorian fashion as well (compared to other NYC hotel rooms that generally have a contemporary feel). Best of all, each room is assigned to a butler who will bring up tea or coffee, or help you with anything you need. The only negative experience I have ever had here (other than the price) is that the last time I asked, they did not have an ATM in the hotel, which seemed a bit odd and was a bit inconvenient. But, that is a small price to pay in my opinion as there is always an ATM within a block or so in NYC."
53,1965,"Nov 27 2007 	Luxurious hotel	I have stayed in this Hotel twice this year. Every time it was excellent! Once we have been upgraded to the Astor suite - spacious room, with fire place and separated living room. Next time we stayed in the deluxe room, which was very nice - beautifully decorate, good size room, big luxurious shower, and view to the streets. (Well only one window, but it was enough). The breakfast at the hotel is amazing. The breakfast room is beautifully furnished, the service and food excellent. (Very good orange juice).But it is also very expensive. For instance one American breakfast(eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage or ham, juice, coffee, pastry basket) for 38dolars!!!! I recommend to share one American breakfast between two people. (the portions are huge)! People from front desk and concierge, very nice, very polite and helpful.Oh I had massage in the spa.. it was nice, but I think that the spa was ok. I expected more since every other services were excellent."
54,1965,"Nov 13 2007 	Upstairs Downstairs.	Stayed at the Saint Regis for 5 nights on Romance package. Grande Luxeroom with breakfast. Absolutely fantastic hotel and location. Strartedwith Limo pickup from JFK in a Merc and got better from there. Great clean and stylish room. Bit on the small side, but good for NY standards. Thought the beds at Peninsula Hong Kong couldnt be beat, Wrong, these beds are sublime. Arrived to a good quality bottle of French champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Upstairs:Butler pretty much superfluous. Introduced themselves on arrival, onlyneeded them once when my phone charger went missing (probably with the sheets and towels) they promised the earth and never appeared again. I went out and bought another next day (cant let lifes little dramas ruin a good holiday) Housekeeping staff very polite and friendly.Downstairs:Concierge and desk staff courteous and friendly, doormen sometimes efficient most times lazy and arrogant (but doormen the world over have chips on their shoulders)Breakfast with Marcos an absolute highlight. Knew our favourite table and requirements and made sure we had it every morning. A great way to start the day, a happy genuine smiling face and a concern for patrons. This is what 5 star service is really about, person to personinteraction and respect. Treating the patrons the way they deserve to be treated when staying at the top hotel in New York. Fantastic location, some great staff, manificent rooms and sublime beds."
55,1965,"Nov 7 2007 	St. Regis concierge team has only 5 star to offer.	I was staying at this hotel during a business meeting.The concierge made all 5 star dinner arrangements, had the theatre tickets, referred me to the best bars and got a spectacular 5 star Limousine provided by CSL Transportation.[--]"
56,1965,"Oct 24 2007 	Super Nice Folks Great Time in New York	Wife and I stayed at the St Regis on Oct. 6th for 5 nights. We are Starwood Gold members and was upgraded to the 4th floor in a standard room (they have two standard rooms before getting into the suites). Room was super. Never stayed in a fancy room like this before. Of course we are not RICH. Felt a little out of place but they dealt with me just fine.We had a super nice butler. She was new to the St Regis. Help us with several things. We went sight seeing on Saturday and came back and we had a large wet spot in the floor, so we call the Butler. We went to eat and came back the wet spot was bigger. They had no idea what was wrong so they upgraded us to a Suite. Now that was too cool. We didn't have to do anything. The butler moved everything for us.We never said a thing. They just moved us. Now that is great service. I had to know how much the suite cost, the price was $2000.00 per night. I could not believe people pay that much to stay at a hotel. Any way, that made our stay even nicer.The staff was super nice. If you plan to stay at the St Regis and are not rich, this is going to be a experience you will never forget.I would love to return to the St Regis but the points are to much now. We got in on last years points base. Super location. If you are Starwood members and want to go to NY, and the St Regis is not in your point range, stay at Sheraton in Time Square. Both Sheratons are right across from each other. You will be right in the middle of Time Square."
57,1965,"Oct 11 2007 	Great Hotel	Beautiful old hotel with updated ammenities that don't seem out of place. Wonderful service- we were traveling with our 6 &amp; 5 year olds so service is everything! Great night sleep- not only was it the best bed I have ever slept in (inc. 4 seasons) the room was completely sound proof. We never heard a horn beep or footsteps outside our door. A very comfortable hotel I highly recommend it if you're staying in midtown. Also the housekeeping was great, we forgot our daughters blanket and they tracked it down for us."
58,1965,"Sep 5 2007 	I looked out at the rats	This is fourth stay at St Regis and my last. I was there for work for four days and whilst I thought as a return guest, Starwood decent card holder and booked through Centurion I would be looked after, I was instead given a low floor, with a smell of cigarettes and with no view. It had one small window that looked out to a cement void that featured a regular rat looking for food. He became a daily friend. Getting a bad cold during the stay didn't help (when I wanted for some natural light as I slept it off). They did get me a housecall doctor which was great - but at $180. I guess that's fair. It is lovely hotel and the right room can make it a great hotel but they seem to play favourites and I wasn't one... I had a problem with my bill and this along with some other problems forced me to write my first ever complaint letter in a hotel. I never got a reply from the Manager I wrote too. What a disappointment."
59,1965,Jul 27 2007 	Fantastic stay	I was put up at the St Regis for 2 weeks by my company - I can't say when I've been treated better or enjoyed a stay more than this one. Excellent.
60,1965,"Jul 3 2007 	Wonderful Stay	We wanted to celebrate our anniversary in style so we looked at a number of luxury hotels in NYC. St. Regis, Mandarin Oriental, Le Parker Meridian. The Mandarin was our first choice but they didn't have the availability. St Regis was a wonderful second.The ambience and decor is definitely old style luxury. Your are brought to your room and soon, your &quot;butler&quot; arrives to introduce you to the amenities of the room including a new touch screen control panel that controls everything. You can ask him for assistance with a number of things but we didn't use the butler service. We got a deluxe room with a very comfortable and plush king bed and sitting area. There is a flat screen tv that comes out of a stand by the foot of your bed for some relaxing in-bed TV. You can swivel the TV around so its facing the couch for viewing there as well. When you are done, press a button and TV lowers out of site. The bathrooms are clean and fancy as well.Definitely let them know if its a special occasion. We mentioned it was our anniversary and when we returned to our room, we found a small bottle of Veuve Cliquot champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us.The only drawback is the steep price. I think we paid $850 + tax for the deluxe room. Its a hefty bill but no more so than the other 5 star luxury hotels in New York. It has a great location in midtown. Close to Central Park and 5th Avenue Shopping. The staff was very polite and helpful."
61,1965,"Jun 19 2007 	Soothing Perfection	Truth be told we sometimes balk at paying over $1000 for a few hours kip, but we were escaping distraught from the hideous Hudson hotel and thought we would treat ourselves, and see if the St. Regis lived up to it's price tag (and reputation.)Our stay didn't start off very well. No one met us with our bags at the door. We had to queue at check-in (this should have been a far slicker affair). A lady who had pushed in front of us gestured for us to go ahead . The rather surly girl at reception asked us whether it was actually our turn, which I thought was extremely rude, (us being British and never queue jumping). She didn't seem capable of smiling, so check in got a thumbs down. It was an early morning escape from the Hudson and our room wasn't ready. We went to have tea in the breakfast room. The service was extremely slow. I had to go and ask the maitre d if anyone would serve us, and she didn't seem bothered that i felt the need to ask. 10 minutes later, and no waiter in sight. Add to this plentiful decibels of drilling and construction noise (for the new Alain Ducasse Restaurant opening there) and we again decided to flee into the much quieter new york streets.The communal areas are OK, a little bit small, but you become accustomed to them.BUT that was the bad. The good was that once we were finally ensconsed in our bedroom we were delighted. As soon as you leave the ground floor and enter the upper corridors, serenity, taste and an immaculate cleanliness abound. Our room must have been newly furnished, as I had never seen such a pristine hotel room. The bedlinen couldn't have been softer, and in the bathroom, everything was perfect. It was even possible to have a shower with out the rest of the bathroom steaming up an iota. Our personal butler George was super efficient and eager to please, and made us feel very at home. Even our maid was beautifully turned out and went about our turn-down service with an unhurried grace that was quite beguiling.A few details in the room weren't quite right (the chandelier didn't work, there was no room service menu) but these were trifles compared to the quality of everything else.The concierge had a few gems...he directed us to a gallery which is selling a picture from &quot;that crazy guy, you know the one that paints the sun&quot; (Van Gogh), and recommended a restaurant on the basis that it was &quot;not one where people go to compare their clothes&quot; - a profound man, and indeed his recommendation for us was spot on.OK long review but the short of it is...service mixed, you've seen a better lobby and dining areas, but the rest is perfection and worth ever penny."
62,1965,"Jun 18 2007 	Error prone luxury	In a super quiet oasis of Beaux Arts luxury in midtown Manhattan we experienced an error prone stay. After gratefully receiving an early check in and a spacious room we received a telephone call not to use the bathroom because there was a sewer problem which would be fixed &quot;in a little while&quot;. Meanwhile we could go across the street to the Sony Center to use the bathroom. However, I was not feeling all that well and had to stay in our room waiting to be told the problem was over. After four hours we telephoned and were told it was all right now. I do not know if we would ever have been notified.In the evening, still not feeling well, I ordered room service and was told the &quot;24 hour room service&quot; would open at 7 pm. When I finally was able to order most of the items on the menu were not available due to &quot; a problem in the kitchen&quot;.  Meanwhile we attempted to find the Silver Sea cruise representative desk and were sent from one floor to the next looking for him. No one seemed to know where he was or when his desk was open.At breakfast the service in the dining room was forgetfull: toast but no bread plates or butter, an unasked for glass of truly awful carrot-ginger juice, a long wait for everything. Then when we checked out we were charged again for the breakfast, although at check-in we had verified that our rate included breakfast. After all these inconveniences we were not offered any complimentary items or compensation, which would have, perhaps, overcome the need to write this negative review of a truly beautiful old-world hotel."
63,1965,"May 30 2007 	Pleasant if stuffy	In NY for business, I stayed at the St Regis for about a month in total. It was consistently good, though the first room I was in was noticably larger and generally better than the second, which seemed to be in a less-recently-renovated part of the building. Small difference were present: the first room had a DVD player, so the second time I bought a DVD only to find the room only had a VCR.The beds are very comfortable, and the staff take their service levels very seriously - arguably a little too seriously for most people's comfort. It all attracts an overly self-satisfied crowd. Still, small details were annoying, like having the dry cleaning come back with everything steamed perfectly flat and proper, but with so much steam having been used that buttons on $500 shirts were cracked. Not just once or twice either. And returned as if nobody noticed, despite the careful folding and two or three layers of wrapping. Contrasts with a far cheaper hotel I stayed in in HK where my casual shirt came back unexpectedly with a missing button replaced and nicely sewn on.Breakfast was excellent, and an exceptionally pleasant way to start the day. All up, I can recommend it as a pleasant if stuffy retreat from the hectic city without, but don't take your good shirts."
64,1965,"May 17 2007 	Totally Awesome	This hotel in all it's magnifigence is way over the top, my son, his wife, children and myself stayed there for 5 nights. We had two roomsand were treated like royalty in every aspect of our stay. This awesome hotel's location is unbelieveable and within walking distanceof everything you could imagine, just very topnotch. Thank you to my son and thank you to all the staff at St Regis that made my stay an unforgettable experience."
65,1965,"Apr 29 2007 	What do you get for $725 per night?	We booked three nights at the St. Regis in January and, like other reviewers, found the hotel well situated with rooms furnished with comfotable beds, fine linens, and luxurious amenities. The comments about the hotel's tight lobby and rooms are all accurate, but what is most disturbing about a hotel at this price point is the disappointing service we experienced. Here are just a few examples - Upon check in, we were informed that we would be provided with a bottle of wine and cheese platter in honor of a special occasion. During our stay, this never arrived. We also dined in the hotel's restaurant for breakfast and afternoon tea. The service during both did not impress. To the hotel's credit, the tea was delicious, but we were unable to finish all the sweets and asked for a box to take them to our room. The waiter offered to deliver them and we accepted this offer. The sweets did not arrive until several hours later and we charged for them at checkout. After two nights at the St. Regis, we decided to leave the hotel early and see if the similarly-priced Penninsula would deliver a better experience (it did - see review). While hotels in NYC can be expensive, those at the upper end of the price range should deliver at all levels. Because the St. Regis failed to deliver the type of service we expected, we will choose another hotel when we return to NYC."
66,1965,"Apr 2 2007	Excellent Hotel	Just returned from NYC, having spent 4 nights at St. Regis, and we are already planning our return trip. Rooms are large, and although the decor is traditional (Empire), all modern convenience (also hygiene and maintenance) are facilitated.Areas are not large or sweeping (if this is you thing, Four Seasons has a large contemporary feel, which contrasts starkly with the food portions in their French Restaurant, (but that's for another review!) , located in same area), but intimate. Nice (small) bar , with interesting art. Great staff, particularly Frank the concierge. Guests interesting too - shared lift with Donald Sutherland!Location hard to beat - great roof top bar across the street at Pennisula."
67,1965,"Mar 18 2007 	An Elegant Past for a Modern Present	We spent two nights at the flagship St. Regis hotel in New York City in February 2007. What a wonderful stay  wed go back again in a minute. This hotel boasts a kind of hushed elegance that strikes just the right counterbalance to the hustle and bustle of New York City. The location, on Fifth Avenue in the mid-50s, is far enough away to avoid the crowds of the theater district but close enough to make getting around simple and straightforward. The lobby and public spaces are both grand and intimate and the hallways are hushed and elegant. The flowers and fine decoration everywhere make it seem the height of luxury. The hotels layout, design, service and amenities are all as top-notch as you would expect. The highlight of our stay was the room. We were upgraded to an Astor Suite and greatly enjoyed the extra space. The rooms are traditional, but with modern amenities and the result is a nice blend of both elegance and technology that is not an easy thing to pull off in a hotel room. The St. Regis succeeds very well in this regard, probably because it has always been a high-end hotel and changes made during the renovation simply updated what was already there. Were not sure if they added soundproofing during the renovation or if the hotel has always been so quiet: either way its a truly relaxing escape, with no outside sounds to interfere with the wonderful ambiance of the rooms. The front desk service, housekeeping and concierges are all excellent. We particularly enjoyed the food and beverage presentations, complimentary pressing and shoe shines and no problem attitude of the wonderful butler service. The only drawback to our stay was the service in the restaurant and bar. Were Four Seasons people and were accustomed to service in the bar and restaurant being one of the highlights of our stay at those properties. Despite the elegance and luxury of the St. Regis, the bar service was perfunctory at best and the breakfast service was slow and mostly unfriendly. Thats a shame, because the space (even with the current construction in the restaurant) is beautiful. We didnt sit in the bar itself because the small space was overflowing with people (we sat in the lower bar/restaurant area instead), but it looked very nice and wed recommend at least seeing it during your stay at this hotel. This is not a hotel for families on vacation in New York City: its a more refined and elegant space than the typical tourist hotel. Its probably also not a hotel for serious business travelers who need service beyond their rooms: the business center is a dark room off the staircase with what looks like discarded furniture and very little privacy. This is a hotel for people looking for an elegant, luxurious, relaxing place to stay in the heart of New York City. If thats what you want, and youre willing to splurge to get it, this is the hotel for you."
68,1965,"Feb 19 2007 	beautiful old world hotel	My new husband and i went to the st. regis the week of our wedding. the hotel was beautiful, i arrived in my wedding dress and we arrived at 2 in the morning and we got greeted with congratulations. We hardly leaved the room, we got upgraded to a room with a small sitting area and it was just beautiful. The bathroom was well stocked with great products and a beautiful shower, tub, and seperate toilet room. The 24- hour butler was an incredible service, we just dialed and we were served with whatever we needed on a silver tray. The most grandoise, luxurious, magnificent, rich hotel you will find in new york city. You dont feel the hustle of the city, you feel like ur in a European hotel. My new husband and I had such a romantic and special first week as newlyweds together in The St. Regis."
69,1965,"Feb 3 2007 	Phenomenal Food and a beautiful hotel	We stayed here for a wedding ceremony and had the best time I've ever had in a hotel. This place was amazing! Our hotel room was the most beautiful room with an esquisite view of the city. We had two bathrooms, a livingroom, and a gorgeous bedroom. I took a long bubble bath in the very clean and luxurious tub. The best part of the whole stay was the wedding upstairs. The food was the best meal my husband and I have ever had! White truffle risotto with Shank, Chocolate dome cakes, everything was top of the line. If I wasn't already married I'd be finding that Chef and taking him hostage for my own forever!"
70,1965,"Jan 16 2007 	An exceptionally fine luxury hotel	We truly enjoyed the St. Regis New York especially for the ultra-luxurious rooms with very comfortable dream beds fit for a king! Although we would categorize just a notch below some of the 5-star grand hotels of Europe, e.g. The Ritz London, Le Meurice Paris, etc. it is nevertheless a delightful retreat does not fail to pamper. The deluxe rooms and the marble bathroom were exceptionally large and beautiful, featuring all the expected amenities While we enjoyed the rooms a great deal, we felt that the lobby and other public areas of the hotel, while retaining the grandeur of the hotel's reputation, were not all that impressive. Service was superb, as would be expected in a hotel of this category. Location is excellent -- if looking for a convenient place to stay in New York, the St. Regis is centrally situated. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to spend upwards of $600 per night for accomodations in Manahattan. Well worth the price."
71,1965,"Jan 11 2007 	Best Hotel in NYC	We returned to the St Regis to celebrate our anniversary. I used points and then extra points to upgrade from a standard to a delux room. I have stayed at this hotel many times and I let them know about our special occasion. The hotel put us in the largest suite I have had at this hotel or any other. It was incredible and unexpected since we used points. In addition I was told that the hotel ws sold out upon my request to extend for one day since it would have been totally free under the Starwood program ,if you use points for 4 nights you can get the fifth night free. The national reservation line said to check with the hotel during our stay. The hotel accomodated us and even let us stay in the suite, wonderful. Go to the new Gordon Ramsey at the London Hotel, it was fantastic and so was Blue Hill in Union Square, a recommendation of the concierge. This was a memorable trip and stay at this grand hotel"
72,1965,"Jan 6 2007 	Mixed bag	This was our first stay at the St. Regis, and it follows recent stays at the Ritz-Carton and Four Seasons in Boston. We loved the location of the St. Regis, and the grandeur and history of this hotel. My wife and I are fans of old, grand hotels, and the St. Regis fit that description. Our stay was a mixed bag. The staff ranged from exceptional to lazy, housekeeping ranged from exceptional to marginal, and our lunch in the bar was nothing special, at a premium price (burger was cold, salad was OK). Our visit to New York was enjoyable, and the St. Regis contributed to that. However, the cost of our accommodations was high, and the service was inconsistent. We have stayed at the Plaza, Ritz-Carlton, Four Season, Palace, and Pierre in New York in the past. Or visit to the St. Regis was the most inconsistent of all (although are stay at the Plaza was just prior to its closing, and there were some service issues)."
73,1965,"Jan 5 2007 	Best hotel every stayed at no displeasures!	This December my aunt treated the whole family to a stay at the St. Regis(paid for completely by points, wow I hope she puts me in her will). It was fantastic! The lobby was nothing too great but the rooms were amazing. My aunt rented one Madison Suite for most of the family and then another room for my and my wife (which was huge, larger than any other standered hotel room) which happened to be connecting to the Presidencial Suite, which had a royal family saying in it. The Madison Suite (room 836) had a huge living room with a very large crystal chandelier and a plasma TV with digital cable. It had a small kitchenette, two large bathrooms, and, in the bedroom, another plasma TV that came up from a cabinet at the foot of the bed. My room (room 1607) was very, very large compared to any other hotel I have ever stayed at. It also had a huge chandelier the plasma TV and all that plus a bathroom with a shower with 2 showerheads, a large bathtub and 3 phones. The phones in this hotel are amazing, in a standered room they put one console phone, from which you may control the lights, climate, butler service, room service (WARNING: Very expesive!!!), wake-up calls and so forth. Oh yes! Dont forget the wet bar and the fax machine. The elevators and pretty small and some large people may have to turn sideways to get into them, as the door is even smaller than the elevator. The hotel is pretty small width-wise, so no room is a hike from the elevators. Overall, if I could afford it by myself it would ABSOLUTLY stay there again."
74,1965,"Dec 6 2006	Wonderful hotel	My husband and I recently stayed at the St Regis for our wedding anniversary. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Deluxe Suite (we had booked an Astor Suite). Champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries awaited us. The suite was breathtaking. The decor sumptious and luxurious (comparable to Claridges, London). Comfortable armchairs, writing desk, TV and a fireplace in the living area, french sliding doors to the sleeping area where another plasma TV rose out of a cabinet at the end of the bed at the touch of a button - perfect for late night movies. A powder room and separate marble bathroom. Beautiful bed linen and towels. Gorgeous Remede products in bathroom and powder room - replenished daily so had a stock to take home! High tech gadgets - lighting, heating CD/DVD/MP3 TV all managed by a space age control pad.Didn't see much of our butler after check in, although she would have unpacked/packed for us if desired. I get the impression they are there if you need them.The breakfast was superb. This was included in our package. We were able to order anything we wanted on the menu - french toast, eggs benedict, blueberry pancakes highly recommended.The King Cole bar is well worth a visit - if only to sample the famous Red Snapper - the Bloody Mary was invented here. Great for people watching - midtown execs coming in for their lunchtime Bull Shots - beef bullion soup and vodka. The burgers were great.Also worth mentioning the concierge desk - they were great and even managed to book me in for a last minute blow-dry at John Barrett's salon in the penthouse suite of Bergdorff Goodman - quite an experience. Business Class Continental from Edinburgh - the only way to travel.Overall everything about this hotel was near perfect. The staff were friendly and efficient, the food and drink were excellent, the surroundings wonderfully opulent. We will definitely return to the St Regis."
75,1965,"Oct 23 2006 	Nice Hotel	Stayed at the St Regis this weekend with my wife and three teenage daughters. We usually stay at the Ritz Carlton Central Park but the trip was last minute and the Ritz did not have rooms that would accomodate five people.I was pleasantly suprised by the St Regis and the hotel staff. Doorman, Bellman, Front Desk, Butler and Concierge were all terriffic. The hotel is still in good shape for an old landmark and the accomodations were clean and very nice and the location is great. We ate breakfast both mornings in the hotel resturant and the food and service were very good.Two deluxe rooms with parking and breakfast for both nights cost almost $5000.00. Not cheap but if you want a first class hotel with great service the St Regis is a good choice. However it is a step below the Ritz or Four Seasons."
76,1965,Sep 20 2006 	Loved the Madison Suite	We recently took our two boys to New York to see a Yankee game and enjoy a New York weekend. We usually stay at The Ritz/Central Park. The Ritz was booked so AmEx booked us at the St Regis. What a wonderful suprise. The Madison Suite was beautiful and huge compared to the Ritz. We had two queen size beds and a living room fit for a king. We placed the &quot;breakfast order&quot; on the door each night and behold...room service set up the living room in grand style for breakfast each morning. This was a treat since we were in a hurry each morning. Food was great as well. The boys enjoyed the flat screen tv's in the bathrooms (2) as well as my husband and I. We have a future trip planned at the Ritz and are in process of changing to the St. Regis. We has a wonderful stay. Only down note: Taxi's were at a min. due to the rain. We took a &quot;pedi-cab&quot; instead. Fun!
77,1965,"Sep 15 2006 	Superb	I can't recommend this hotel more highly. Staff members were pleasant, polite and friendly. No one was in the least snobby. Service was prompt, and our needs were anticipated at every turn.The rooms are gorgeous, and kept impeccably. The food was good, in particular the fruit was wonderful. The views are poor, and the hotel was honest with me about that when I booked my room. I decided I didn't care much about that, and we had a great time. I would stay there again any time."
78,1965,"Aug 16 2006 	They must be kidding	Overpriced room rates do not grant great service  that is for sure. I dont know what they got their awards for - service it is not. Besides, the former gem of a hotel has lost its charm. What did they do to the rooms? Breakfast was mediocre at best  not what we were used to. Staff is plain snobby. Isnt the company publicly traded or so? That would explains how they keep busy. Looking at trip-advisor stories of other visitors, I must say that they read like a hotel brochure."
79,1965,"Aug 8 2006 	A Special Experience	First of all, unless you're willing to spend an outrageous sum of money simply to have a once-in-a-lifetime type of experience, don't even think of staying here. Like the decor and service, the prices are over the top. I paid $600 per night, and that was with a AAA discount on a summer weekend. Cocktails in the King Cole Bar run $15-$20. Room service breakfast is $30, before the service charges and taxes. --BUT--it's completely worth it. This is not simply about a luxurious place to leave your bags, lay your head, and have an evening cocktail. The St. Regis is a representation of a lifestyle that most of us can only afford on an infrequent splurge, if at all. These are guest rooms straight out of Versailles and staff for whom service is a career, not a stopover job. The location, at 5th Avenue and 55th St., is right in the middle of prime shopping and close to Central Park and Rockefeller Center. The Theatre District is a short cab ride or moderate stroll away. The rooms are something special, with ornate [but not overly so] decor including half-canopies on the beds, plush carpeting, huge bathrooms [by New York standards], good-sized closets, and padded silk wall coverings. My room was done in soothing and highly attractive muted tones of steel blue and mint green. I understand there are a couple of color schemes. There's also a &quot;command center&quot; at the bed, which will allow you to control all the lights in the room, adjust the air/heat, play different types of music, look up hotel/tourist information, and page your butler. [Each floor has a personal butler assigned who will take care of your every wish. You'll be taken up to your floor by the front desk staffer, where you'll be greeted by your butler at the elevator.] I would definitely recommend spending the extra $50 or so per night and getting the deluxe room, which includes a sitting area. The sitting area turned out to be a comfortable silk sofa, nice armchair and a coffee table with a large live orchid. There's also an end table with a selection of treats such as fresh fruit, nuts, mineral water and chocolates [complimentary]. The service can't be faulted--two items are allowed for complimentary pressing and they will be returned by the butler with a hand-written note. Luggage is handled extremely efficiently and every request is seen to promptly. They didn't drop the ball on anything during my entire stay. There's also an e-butler who can handle pre-arrival requests by e-mail--a nice, convenient touch.The King Cole Bar is legendary as the birthplace of the Bloody Mary [originally the Red Snapper] and the famous mural. Service here is also top-notch; easy-going but professional. The room is smallish, but in a cozy way with comfortable seating and expertly-made cocktails. The restaurant is open for all meals--didn't eat there, but it's a nice room with large windows. There are also a couple of lounges in small rooms off the lobby with intimate seating groupings, high ceilings and beautiful antique furniture. If you require a sweeping view, this may not be the place for you. The park-view rooms at the Ritz-Carlton may be better. But everything else about the St. Regis is absolutely superb."
80,1965,"Aug 2 2006 	Curious?? Is the High Price worth it???	CURIOUS?? Why would you spend thousands of Australian Dollars to stay in an Astor Suite at the St Regis? I was!! -along with 2 female Aussie friends I saved my money so that we could book an Astor Suite for 3 nights furing a New York Visit that formed part of a 5 week Europe and America Dream Vacation.So.... Is it worth the expense?? EVERYONE Should Live the High Life and Experience the St. Regis! This venue didn't disappoint - but lived up to its reputation of Luxury with Refined Understated Elegance. Like me, if never having stayed in a venue in this price range you may be very curious what it is that a venue like this could possibly offer that would make it worth the high price? Well, let me try to explain our experience.... On arrival we were warmly greeted by reception and escorted to our suite -(A lovely personal touch!) where we were introduced to our butler who returned within 10 minutes of our arrival with complimentary cheese and fruit platter and a steaming pot of coffee! As I relaxed on the gorgeous french antique style lounge, absorbed the luxurious but elegant decor and surfed the 100+ tv channels on the large flat screen tv - all thoughts of lost airport luggage, shopping and tourist attractions were put aside - One of our party opted for a soak in the deep marble tub (filled with Italian Aqua Di Parma luxury Bath Salts) - relaxing under the light of the bathroom chandelier while watching the large flat screen tv mounted above the bath! My other friend curled up on luxurious crisp egyptian cotton sheets with a feather pillow and a complimentary fashion magazine as our butler arranged for our luggage to be unpacked, our clothing pressed and our shoes shined. Within the hour we had settled and found our new home for the next 3 days...  Despite the obvious attractions of 5th Avenue and New York City being right on your doorstep the St. Regis old world elegant charm very quickly took hold and we were reluctant to spend much of our 3 day visit away from the venue! The St. Regis is an experience that everyone should STOP to enjoy! By all means, on a tourist visit to New York - perhaps stay in another cheaper standard 5 star Hotel as a base for day trips (eg. Waldorf Astoria, &amp; Times Square Marriot was also nice and great locations) - but factor into your visit a couple of nights at this more exclusive venue to allow the opportunity to stop and relax in New York City away from the crowds and the traffic and the hustle and bustle of life.Do as we did and save the extra funds required -and splurge on the experience. Sip Champange for Breakfast, visit the day spa, enjoy the room service, appreciate the twice daily servicing of your room by house-keeping, the turndown service, the daily complimentary delivery of fresh roses and fruit &amp; pastry platters, and enjoy the friendly but non obtrusive pampering from the hotel service staff, At the end of our booked stay we reluctantly checked out to transfer over to the Waldorf Astoria. During dinner that evening we reviewed our St.Regis Experience and realized we now had answered the question commonly asked by family members and friends who had learnt of the cost of our booking - , &quot; Why would you spend so many thousands of dollars on 3 nights of accomodation at a Hotel? (Aus $2800 per night) How can it possibly be worth it?? &quot; As we sadly farewelled the St. Regis - the answer was a clear and unaminous YES it was worth it! Every Aussie Dollar was well spent! It wasn't really any longer so much a question of whether this famous Hotel was worth it but rather - more the statement that WE are worth it!EVERYONE deserves and should take the opportunity to experience such a luxurious escape from the reality of daily living.So Save up for an experience that will give you a taste of life at a higher level... As one of my friends commented - &quot; I felt really uncomfortable when I arrived....not being used to such luxury and over the top 'Tiffany silver service!' - On departure her comment was - &quot;I now feel so different - very comfortable with Chandeliers in the bathroom! This experience has made me feel like a Princess, stretched my comfort Zone, my expectations and desire to achieve-I now feel like I could own the place!&quot; That made it Worth it! - Having had but a small taste of lifestyles of the 'Rich and Famous&quot; - might just help propel these 3 young single Aussie girls on to greater levels of personal &amp; career success- Because we have now developed the taste for the finer things in life ! Not sure you can justify the price tag??? Take it from us - You ARE worth it!!!"
81,1965,"Jul 31 2006	hey big spender!	Without peers. We felt a bit of trepidation over the price of the room and the comps (seems everyone else has a better priced room), but all fears quickly put to rest when checking in. The staff at the desk show you to your room, and explain everything to you. Hotel is a gorgeous old dame that sparkles and the staff are telepathic without being unnerving. We had a newly decorated jr. suite and our daughter, feeling like a princess, was next door. It is expensive, but if you can forget to look at the right side of the menu during your stay, it's a good value for your dollar. It has a decent gym, a beautiful room for afternoon tea, a floor butler to do your bidding, great food, and a good concierge. Sadly, when we ran out of money and had to leave (kidding), they offered to drive us to the hertz rental agency a block and a half away. in the bentley.there was not one flaw -we would highly recommend this hotel."
82,1965,"Jul 12 2006	My favorite kind of hotel	Hotels like this are the last of a breed, the old-world, traditional luxury accomodation, with beautiful furniture, elegant public areas, polite and cultured staff, fine towels, carpeting, bed fabrics. I stayed in their Grand room, a step above the basic, and it was quite elegant,a nd amply sized. it was immaculate in every way. The bathroom was equisite, a separate toilet room, a wonderful (and powerful) shower room, and fine Aqua de Parma shampoos and soaps. It's really nice when you enter your room and are followed in moments by a black-tied butler who offers to put your clothing away. He had my shirts ironed and returned to the room quickly, and was always on call at the touch of a very high tech touch screen control in the room. There is also a fine Sony LCD television. This is an experience well worth the money. If you've never stayed somewhere like this, you owe it to yourself. It is so vastly superior to the likes of the Sheratons, Hiltons, Hyatts and Marriots! I paid $550 thru American Express platinum travel, and got upgraded, plus received free breakfasts (which are around $50/person!), and a late checkout, plus an afternoon tea which I didn't bother with.This is a fine hotel, on part with Claridges in London, and I feel very comfortable recommending it."
83,1965,"Jun 18 2006	EXTRAORDINARY	Husband and I stayed 2 nights and celebrated our 1st anniversary here in a grand luxe room..WOW...the renovated rooms are gorgeous...so elegant....our room was decorated in shades of a soothing green-blue and gold...the reviewer who complained about the renovations below must be BLIND...there are still beautiful pieces of antique French furniture throughout the room, the seating area was upholstered in dramatic damask fabrics which matched the headboard, and a stunning large crystal chandelier over the bed...the rooms have been &quot;modernized&quot; with wonderful conveniences such as a flat screen television which is inches away from your bed and can be swiveled around to the sitting area...all white bedding and an absolutley divine supersoft plump down comforter...how on earth can you complain about that??? The bathroom was adorned in gorgeous marble with gold antique sconces...large soaking tub, separate toilet, and separate shower stall....the butler service was quick and exceptional...so friendly....and talk about a great location...CANNOT WAIT to go back!"
84,1965,Apr 19 2006	excellent	this is our second time at the sst regis new york- we came from new orleans to get away for easter and can not say enough about the hotel- the rooms were spotless- the food was excellent- the concierge was very helpful- it was such a great experience we will go again real soon- it is definately a 5 star hotel and meets all our expectations-from new orleans
85,1965,Mar 31 2006	Picture Perfect	What can I say? I loved the St. Regis in NYC. I used to live in NYC and hadn't been back in over 18 months so I wanted my trip to be worthwhile. I booked a great Astor floor room under the Taste of Luxury package (3 nights/4th free - all inclusive). Everyone made me feel extraordinarily comfortable and special. The room was perfect. I specifically requested for a muted room because bright colors give me headaches and they saw to my request. I loved the TV that comes as if from nowhere. I loved the touch panel controller. I loved the size of the room. We had room service for 4 very comfortably and they didn't even charge me the extra two (my package came with breakfast for 2). I loved their bathrooms. Very spacious and lovely. My boyfriend and I had a great time. I now live in LA and he lives in DC but we both love NY and would only stay at the St. Regis in NYC.
86,1965,"Mar 6 2006	We left!!!	My family was very excited about celebrating two birthdays by spending President's weekend in NY.After spoending all day at the airport with a cancelled flight, we checked into the St Regis and ran to our Broadway Show.Upon returning to the room, we found a closet with 18 inches of hanging space. Being exhausted, we went to sleep without unpacking.We were greeted in the morning with a view of heating pipes and pidgeons doing their &quot;thing.&quot;We had asked when making the reservation for a room with a view.We were so disappointed that we immediately checked out and went to the Palace. While the Palace does not have the charm, the professional and accomodating staff helped make a wonderful vacation.The St Regis is not the &quot;only game in town.&quot;I really do not understand why they would treat first time guests this way. We will never return to the St Regis, and will not recommend this place to anyone."
87,1965,"Mar 3 2006	Soooo Sad	I have been a regular guest at the St. Regis Hotel, New York. Over the years, I have stayed at the hotel many times and I have grown to love the place. I was even married at the hotel a couple of years ago (Pre-renovation). My wife and I decided to celebrate our anniversary by staying at the hotel last week (Post Renovation). We reserved a Grand Luxe Room. Having heard that the hotel was undergoing a major renovation, my wife an I were eager to see what had been done. Upon entering our &quot;newly renovated&quot; room, we were shocked. Don't let the lobby fool you folks. In the guest rooms, all of the ambiance of the guilded age has been stripped away and replaced by modern furniture, a television that pops out of a gray fabric box and wall coverings and curtains that reminded my wife and I of a guest room at a typical Sheraton. What happenned to the beautiful furniture, the elaborate curtains and the tapestries???? As our mouths dropped to the floor, all we could say was &quot;WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???!!!&quot; We soon learned that, with the exception of certain suites (which apparently remain unrenovated and decorated as before - thank God), the entire hotel (Superior Deluxe and Grande Luxe) has been renovated in a new and modern style. HOW SAD. This is clearly not the St. Regis we had grown to love. As for the new and improved Spa, don't expect any surprises. As a matter of fact, a new coat of paint and newly installed handicap access in the locker room is all that has been changed. On a positive note, Juan Manuel, the best waiter in New York, still works in the hotel's restuarant, the Astor Court. If you eat there, be sure to ask for him. Sadly, after many years of great experiences and wonderful memories, last week marked the last time my wife and I will stay at teh St. Regis, New York. Fortunately, the Ritz Carlton is just down the street."
88,1965,"Feb 12 2006	Agree with ""Going Downhill""	My husband and I spent our 15th wedding anniversary at the St. Regis and will not return. We chose the St. Regis for this special anniversary and expected that as Starwood Platinum members we would be treated well. Instead, we were ignored, forgotten and lied to.At check-in, it was clear that our room was not ready. When I pointed out that we were Platinum members celebrating our 15th anniversary, the clerk nervously searched her computer. When I asked her if we had been upgraded as Platinum members, she replied that we had. In fact, we were not upgraded at all and were placed on the lowest floor with no view and lots of street noise.The newly renovated room was pleasant, but it was not what we expected as Platinum guests. We were not given our amenity points because, according to the front desk personnel, &quot;we treat all guests specially.&quot; She assured my husband that flowers and fruit would be delivered. We did receive some fruit but no flowers.The &quot;personal butler&quot; is clearly a misnomer. We met our butler and asked for a luggage rack. When it was not delivered after an hour, we contacted the front desk and were told that our new butler would be arriving soon. She delivered the luggage rack, but by this time I had unpacked my bag on the floor. The next day we called our butler and got no response. She called me an hour later saying she had missed our call. These were our only two experiences with our personal butler.Supposedly breakfast was included with our room, but I had to call the front desk repeatedly to learn the particulars and was told several different stories. In the end, we were charged an extra fee for our breakfast even though my husband was assured by the room service person that we would not be. At check-out the clerk was unable to print out an itemized receipt but she said, &quot;Your breakfast was over $100.00, ma'am.&quot; I had pancakes, orange juice and tea!&quot;I've been a loyal Starwood Platinum member for years, and generally, I am very impressed. But, the St. Regis was certainly not up to par. In fact, my most recent experience at the Sheraton at the Portland, Oregon Airport far exceeded my stay at the so called world famous St. Regis. My advice would be to save your money and stay elsewhere."
89,1965,"Feb 6 2006	Good hotel with various glitches not on par with Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton	I stayed at St.Regis Hotel from 25 -30th Janaury, got the taste of Luxury package which allowed me in January to stay 4 nights but had only to pay three. On top of that I had breakfast included and all room taxes which was a pretty good deal, but still I had to pay US$ 670 a night for a deluxe room. The fifth night was a starwood award night.If you pay US$ 670 a night you expect nothing less than the best. Unfortunately if I take the price there were some inconveniences which make us believe that the hotel isn't on par with e.g. Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons or the smaller more intimate luxury hotels in the upper East Side:First the goodThe Deluxe on the 15th floor was nicely appointed and freshly renovated. The bed was the best I ever have slept in a hotel, very comfortable, warm with duvet etc....Housekeeping was very good and they performed a very nice turndown service.Bathroom was of adequate size with a separate showerstall with a rainforest shower which you didn't want to exit after you have entered.Butler service a nice touch, but not really needed.The less goodNot enough drawer space for your luggage and clothes. Breakfast quality was lousy for a hotel of such a quality.Some other minor glitches in the room and service make us overall believe that the hotel is not totally on par for the price they are charging.As I said overall a very good hotel with some glitches, would I stay again at this hotel, considering the price probably not, I would try something else.I was expected to be blown away - and I wasn't"
90,1965,"Jan 31 2006	The Best...Again!	We just spent the weekend at the St. Regis and arrived back home last night(1/30). It was our 5th time at the St. Regis over the last 15 years, and our 20th Wedding Anniversary. Once again, the St. Regis did not disappoint and luxuriated us with the finest of everything...service, room service(Colorado Lamb Chops with the wild mushroom cassoulet..incredible), and of course, the room. We splurged on an Astor Suite and had a ball! Three TV's (plasma in the living room), pin drop silence, private butler at your beck and call, stunning bathroom, etc, etc....we didn't want to leave and, in fact, had about 7 room service calls. We can't wait to go back for our 25th!"
91,1965,"Jan 23 2006	Traditional New York Luxury	I took my sister-in-law and two of my nieces (aged 10 and 6)for their first trip to New York and the St. Regis made it quite a memorable experience. Yes, it is very expensive, but worth the price. We stayed in a Grand Deluxe room, which was lovely. Decorated in muted green and gold, with modern amenities such as flat panel tvs. The staff couldn't have been nicer, bringing cookies and hot chocolate after a long day of sightseeing. I tried to book the Four Seasons, but they wanted us to book two rooms at almost $800 per night because of &quot;occupancy requirements&quot;, which was ridiculous. The St. Regis could not have been more accomodating. Luxury like this certainly does come with a hefty price tag, but they also gave us wonderful memories."
92,1965,"Jan 8 2006	Going downhill	Just returned from a weekend trip to New York and stayed at the St Regis. This is our 8th stay at the hotel. We used to love this hotel, but after this last stay, we will not be going back. The butler did not come to introduce him/herself like usual. We had breakfast at the hotel's lobby restaurant and got very mediocre service (this has been a problem in the past which I wrote the hotel about. Apparently, they are not interested in doing anything about it). On our last night, the sink backed up and dirty water started filling the sink and bathtub. We called the front desk who sent the butler to our room. His first question was &quot;What did you do ? This never happened before&quot;. I gave him a dirty look and just said I didn't do anything and I never took a bath in the tub, which is where some really disgusting stuff was coming up from the drain. After checking out, we were waiting outside for the cab and the porter went to get our bags (we brought them down from the room ourselves but left them with the porter as we walked across the street for about half hour before coming back for our bags). We stood waiting for over 20 minutes with no explanations of why it was taking so long. The service we got just did not live up to a hotel of this calibre. We had dinner at the Four Seasons Lobby restaurant and the service there put the St Regis to shame. I will avoid going back to this hotel in the future."
93,1965,"Sep 11 2005	Luxury at the Reeg!	For Valentine's Day last year, my boyfriend treated us to a night at the St. Regis, such a decadent thing for 2 New York locals! Maybe it was the amazing foie gras we had at dinner at the hotel restaurant, or maybe it was the fact that we were eating chocolates and sipping champagne in our giant comfy bed, but we had such a nice time. The rooms are super quiet, the hotel is convenient to all the shopping on 5th Ave, and the service is impeccable. We also enjoyed the gorgeous marble bathroom and sitting area in our room.I also stayed here with my family when they came to visit me for Thanksgiving 2004. Again, the hotel staff was attentive w/o being obtrusive, and the environment was cheery and festive at this time of the year. The only problem is that the views, if you are on the rear side of the building, aren't exactly appealing. Many of the rooms look at a back courtyard, so all you see is brick building.Overall, I highly recommend this place; it's really a treat!"
94,1965,"Aug 5 2005	Luxury at the St. Regis	My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for 1 night August 3-4,2005.It was a special night to celebrate our birthdays. It was beautiful and we loved every minute of our stay. The staff was exceptional and the service superb. Our room was very beautiful in an elegant motif as befitting a 5 star hotel. The service was exemplary and rare to find these days.The location on 5th avenue and 55th street was excellent for shopping, dining and the theater. Our breakfast was delicious and in lovely surroundings. An extraordinary treat if you desire something special is a stay at the St. Regis,"
95,1965,"Jul 31 2005	Pure elegance and attention to detail!	After having stayed at many of the finer hotels in NYC, the St. Regis was a welcomed surprise. Everything from the beautifully appointed suite, to the butler who seemed to guess our every whim, to the fabulous afternoon tea - this hotel was by far the most luxurious stay that I've had in the city. I can't say enough about it and can't wait to go back and be pampered again!"
96,1965,"Jul 28 2005	Absolute Perfection	Wow where to start?!!? I initially booked a Grand Deluxe room through the SPG Gold prefered guest line and recieved a very good rate at only $620 a night. After this I called the hotel to make arrangements for limo transfers. The concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgable and they provided competitive rates.  So after much anticipation I arrived at the St regis after a 12 hour flightfrom Hawaii. As you can imagine jet lag was in tow. Anyway as soon as we entered the lobby we were greated by the lobby manager and escorted to the marble everywhere lobby where check in lasted not even 3 mins. We were then escorted to the 11th floor and to our surprise found out that because it was my sons birthday they had complimentarily upgraded us to a Madison Suite. ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT!!! it was huge about 1000 sq ft, large for manhattan standards. The foyer was tiled in italian marble and all of the walls were covered in sumptuous silk. the living room overlooked madison avenue and had a 50 inch plasms tv, as well as a very charming and luxurious seating area. The beds in the bedroom were to die for. see for yourselves at my pictures. But the best part was the service. Our butler, Barbara, always greated us promptly when we called and with a pleasent smile. She gave us anything we wanted even help using our digital camera. the doormen were efficient with taxis and excorting us to the lobby. The maids, Sadika in particular, made us feel like this was our home. I left the St regis feeling like i was leaving some of my family behind. I still miss the staff and cant wait untill my next visit. I can hands down say that this is the best hotel i have ever stayed at. And believe me i have been to numerous 5 star hotels and this one beats them by far. Perfect stay!!"
97,1965,"Jun 27 2005	Unparalleled elegance comfort and service!	My husband and I just spent 3 days at the St. Regis for our 5 year Anniversary and we were beyond impressed. From the moment we stepped in the door we were treated with the utmost respect and kindness. We were escorted to our room and introduced to our butler. The 24-hour butler service is extraordinary. They think of things you would never imagine. He brought us a dozen exquisite yellow roses with orange outer petals and a bottle of champagne, all complimentary. About 10 minutes later he then brought another dozen roses, this time longstem red roses, that my husband had ordered. The hotel has it's own florist and the roses were just beautiful. They were all perfectly open and looked like velvet. I even took them home with me so I can continue to enjoy them. The room was elegant but cozy and very well appointed. The location was a perfect home-base for all the sight-seeing we did and the concierge desk was most helpful for anything we needed.The turndown service can't be beat. Slippers on either side of the bed (his and hers), bottles of mineral water, and fresh ice in the bucket. We came back to the hotel from seeing Spamalot (don't miss it if you get the chance!) and the butler brought us not only the ice we requested, but a huge tray of complimentary delicious pastries and desserts. Fresh fruit and chocolates in the room and a well-stocked bar were another plus. We had breakfast in the room one morning and the food was excellent, especially the pancakes. The staff was extremely pleasant and catered to our every whim as well as those things we would never think of but amazed us nonetheless. We even checked out and had them hold our luggage so we could continue sight-seeing on the last day. I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience there and will recommend the St. Regis to everyone I know. It is definitely a one-of-a-kind hotel and the staff will ensure you have an amazing experience. I can't wait to go back!"
98,1965,"Jun 19 2005 	Trust this snob..there is no place better.	I have never been more compelled to write a hotel review in my life! I am going to keep it short and simple. This was one of the best hotel stays of my life, and you can bet I have had a few and at some very special hotels. I recently stayed at the St Regis for 9 nights on business, each day got better and better and I was actually sad to leave. It felt like home to me. The staff was unbelievable and the service second to none. The gym was small but great. My room was simply excellent. Very high ceilings, gorgeous furnishings, a fabulous chandelier,walk-in closet, shower was amazing, towels soft and inviting and it had a very nice bed. The concierge went above and beyond and was very knowledgable. Yes, the food was expensive as one might expect, but it always is at a hotel like this, besides it was delicious.Stay here with my highest recommendation. I will make it my new home on all subsequent trips to NY."
99,1965,"May 29 2005	If you want to be be pampered stay at the St. Regis	As a treat for our 20th anniversary, my husband and I stayed at the St. Regis in NYC. I upgraded to a butler room for some extra spoiling, and we were not disappointed. The room was lovely, quiet and comfortable. The only negative I can remember, is that I think the towels were a little too old to be considered soft &amp; fluffy. They were OK. Fresh fruit and regular bottled water or sparkling water were available. Because I let them know we were celebrating an anniversary, chocolate covered strawberries &amp; a half bottle of wine were delivered compliments of the St. Regis. I haven't stayed at other 5-star hotels in NYC, so I cannot compare my stay with other 5-star hotels in NYC. I did enjoy the butler service for major spoiling! You cannot beat the location of the St. Regis, especially if you want to go shopping or visit art galleries &amp; museums. We had drinks and a light dinner at the bar. The food was fair. I enjoyed the mural by Maxfield Parish. All in all, I enjoyed our stay, and it met or exceeded my expectations."
100,1965,"Apr 27 2005	Simply the best - 5 dots are not enough	We have just spent the most amazing 3 days at the St Regis for my wifes 40th Birthday. I think it would be far to say that we are reasonably seasoned travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, but none of them come to close to the level of service we experienced at the St Regis. I think every hotel you stay in there is always something you could say wasnt up to scratch, but it wont be worth complaining about because it is so insignificant. If you go to the St Regis you will have a funning feeling that you cant put your finger on because it takes a while to work out that everything in the hotel is done to perfection. Every member of staff is one step ahead of your every move without been intrusive and you are always greeted with a smile. Breakfast was wonderful, room service was divine and the spa was out of this world. The butler was excellent, even with making tea at 5.30am (jet lag) and chambermaids made sure everything was spotless in the most amazing bedroom. Finally, afternoon tea to die for. If you want the best and to experience something no other hotel has very achieved, for us anyway, then splash out and go to the St Regis."
101,1965,"Mar 17 2005	Top Quality!	Well, where to start? ive stayed there 3 times and loved it, i met will smith there too. top quality butlers, rooms, service, etc etc"
102,1965,"Feb 25 2005	Wouldn't Stay anywhere else	I go to New York 4 or 5 times a year- and I always stay at the St. Regis on 5th and 55th. I've stayed at the Mark, the Regency, the Plaza, and the four seasons. The St. Regis is by far the most luxurious and wonderful out of all of them. The service is outstanding- they get to know you on a personal level, they anticipate your needs, and cater to your every demand. Every room has a butler on call 24 hours a day. The rooms are amazing... even the standard rooms. They have high ceilings, large closets and bathrooms. The suites are huge- they have a foyer... two full bathrooms... large living rooms... dressing rooms... its just amazing. The beds are heavenly... they are hard to get out of! They will do anything to make you happy- I was once coming back from a club and called from a cab and asked them to have a bottle of grey goose and cranberry... and a pack of cigarettes waiting. Everything was already in my room- all set up. It is a fabulous hotel... and I would recommend staying there- of course it is more expensive than most hotels- but its worth it. I just stayed in a W hotel the other weekend because everything was all booked- and compared to the st. regis it was a dump..."
103,1965,"Jan 24 2005	Near the top...	Great hotel, great location and a great big bill. Accoms were fantastic, beautiful rooms and all that you would expect for the price.Concierge is definitely used to the high rollers as they quoted us $1,000 per ticket to see the Stones and MSG - needless to say we were able to get better deals without much headaches. Other small concierge issues but if you are a usual visitor to NY it shouldn't be a problem to find what you need in the city.Great bar."
104,1965,"Dec 28 2004	Confusion meets Luxury	First for the Positives:-Very nice and descriptive web page.-Adequate selection of accomodations and competitve and corressponding prices.-Courteous front desk and lobby personnel.-Beautiful and awe inspiring room furnishings.-Superb location Negatives:Well, I can't really put the negatives in bullet form but I can state them properly in a paragraph. Everything seemed to me going very nicely until they confused my reservation. I initially booked a Deluxe King room in the Taste of Luxury package for around $650 a night, and the fourth night I was told would be free. But when I called to re-confirm they rudely stated that I was mistaken and that the fourth night was not free. This really ticked me off, so I faxed a copy of the rate details of the room over to the Executive Offices of the hotel, in this fax it showed them that the fourth night was in fact free. So then within 20 hours the Executive assistant Ms. Kim, called me to tell me that they will gladly honor my rate. Then the next day I called to re-confirm my reservation and was told very rudely again that my reservation had been canceled and that I had to wait until the morning to call back and re book. Then I called the Preffered guest reservation line and confromted them with my problem and was told that my reservation was NOT cancelled. So from there I told her that I needed proper compensation and was again instructed to contact Customer service in the morning.After this fiasco I must say that I enjoyed the trip except for the parts before my checking in to the hotel. The rates are reasonably priced for what you get except make sure you check on you reservation every so often and print out the rate details of your reservation. Overall pretty good!"
105,1965,"Dec 6 2004 	Great location 	I last stayed at the St Regis nearly 10 years ago, and returned last month (November 2004). The best thing about it is its midtown location, close to Central Park &amp; 5th Ave. stores. Our room was luxurious as you would expect at those prices and the bed extremely comfortable. The butler on your floor brings complimentary tea/coffee and there are 2 complimentary clothes items pressed per person. They even provided decaffeinated tea at 4.30 a.m. when we were wide awake with jet lag. (What is the protocol with these butlers - is one supposed to tip them every time?) However, I was disappointed with the public rooms; in particular, there was no comfortable place to have coffee. We had invited someone to join us for coffee and were directed to a table in the dining room where we had not long before eaten breakfast. I inquired about the bar and they said it would be possible to bring the coffee through there, but on inspection, the bar area was dark &amp; uninviting so we stayed in the dining room.We were leaving New York on a evening flight from La Guardia and I requested a late check out. This presented a problem until I offered to pay for half a day, when the problem disappeared. I think that hotels are entitled to expect payment for use of the room in such circumstances, especially at busy times (this wasn't such a time) but I do think that if they are being paid, then a hotel of this standard ought to service the room and they did not. (Especially as twice daily service is included in the full day rate - so surely one room service should be included for half a day)"
106,1965,"Oct 29 2004	The St. Regis was Awesome!	We stayed at the St. Regis in mid October for my birthday. I had notified the front desk that we were arriving early in the morning and were hoping to get an early check in (flew from LA to NYC on a red-eye). Unfortunately the room was not available but the front desk staff were very nice and even wished me a happy birthday. They took my cell phone number and promised to call when the room was available but did not hear back. Later in the afternoon, after walking to central park and the Met, we arrived back at the hotel around 3 p.m. - they had upgraded our room to an astor suite on the top floor (i have platinum starwood status) - the front desk agent took us up to the room. The suite was very nice - formal type furniture. Bed was comfortable and the rooms were very clean. The only gripe was that the TV's are a bit small.On my birthday, the hotel manager had a 1/2 bottle of Taittinger champagne delivered to the room. It was a great surprise and showed how great the service had been. We utilized the butler service a few times - for ice and wine glasses and for shoe shine service. Do be wary though of dining - breakfast for 2 can be about $90.Excellent stay. The pictures on the web make the hotel look much bigger than it actually is. Perfect location - easy walk to 5th ave shopping and many dining locations are close by. Would definitely stay here again."
107,1965,"Sep 30 2004 	Being in oasis	I stayed in St Regis in September 2004, actually for the second time. As always, great room, great service. The hotel was very busy at that time, but the service was still very quick. The more impressive was the check-out. Despite quite a limited space at reception and many people, they dealt with the guests very fast. I was a bit late for the plane and thus nervous, but they saved me some nerves.Because the hotel was fully booked I did not receive an upgrade (though I am gold SPG member) and the room was a bit dark and had interior view. But still the deluxe room I stayed was like in a palace.To those who say it's pricy, I can tell that their rates are fully consistent with other best New York hotels. And although this time I stayed almost at full rate, last year I received a very good discount.I will certainly come back to this hotel. Staying there is like being in oasis in the middle of a noisy and busy city."

1,1967,"Oct 3 2009 	Too far from the heart of New York	The main issue we have with this place is that it's not a motel / hotel set up - it's run by private owners and basically there are only 3 rooms spread throughout the terrace (not the entire terrace like what we thought was the case). Problem with that is there's no internet or phone facilties which is a real nightmare when it comes to travellers. no doubt the owners will be more than happy to help when we ask for assistance but when you are out early and back late it's not convenient to knock on their doors when you need to book that train /bus tickets late at night. Location is too far from heart of new york. While i wouldn't say it's dangerous, it's a silent brisk walk back from the train station each night and a sigh of relief when we finally get into the room. It's a 20 min train (at least) to Times Sq as it's on a non-express train. Personally i think it's a waste of time travelling up and down each day esp when you are a tourist. With this in mind the price is rather steep for such a neighbourhood.Rooms and facilities are still ok - but of course sans housekeeping so you will be better off getting a lower class hotel in the city with about the same price. Bear in mind also their cancellation policy.overall i think it's not too bad but just not my cup of tea and definitely not deserving of the reviews/ranking it has so far. i don't mind staying here if i am on a working stint but not as a tourist strap for time and needing the basic internet."
2,1967,"Aug 5 2009 	a perfect place to stay	It was a very nice and peaceful place to stay. In the middle of Harlem with a grocery store at the corner where you can buy all your food. Subway at 2 minutes walk, rapid line at 10 minutes walk. Julio the owner is very nice, you can ask him everything. Everything is available in the appartment: well-equiped kitchen, terrace outside, luxury bathrooms and liviing room. The decoration is beautiful with African art. There is one big bedroom and one small bedroom, the fourth person has to sleep on the (comfortable) couch in the living room."
3,1967,"Jul 25 2009 	Lovely and we felt completely safe!!	This is a wonderful chance to be in the city that never sleeps but still have your safe lovely street in Harlem!, looking like it is in an english little town. We were really surprised by this lovely guesthouse, friendly hosts and so easy to get into downtown New York! Although we stayed in Harlem, what might give you the idea that it would not be safe? We never felt unsafe at any moment, we came back late in the evening, walked through the neighbourhood, did our shopping and had nice contacts with the people.Also, in the direct neighbourhood very lovely nice, affordable, hip, restaurants!Just take the 163 street Metro and you will be in Manhattan in a short while taking the express train! We will be back!"
4,1967,"Jul 21 2009 	Amazing character coziness and charm!	We loved staying at Sylvan Guest House. the proprietors, the historical neighbourhood, and the inviting character of the apartment itself made our stay very memorable!Totally worth the money, and we'd definitely stay again.A great introduction to Harlem!!!"
5,1967,"Jul 21 2009 	I loved it and would come back anytime I'm in New York	I enjoyed my brief stay in the Studio at The Sylvan Guest House and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a safe place in a historical neighborhood. Of course it's not in midtown, but I found that as a distinct advantage.I look forward to a return to the Sylvan on my next trip to New York."
6,1967,"Jul 21 2009 	The Place to stay - Sylvan Guest House	Having just returned from staying at the Sylvan Guest House as a single female, I am quite shocked to see such a review as the one before. Staying here was fun and I enjoyed every single moment relaxing in a warm, safe and comfortable environment that felt like home away from home. It felt great coming home to a place which was exactly what the photographs showed. Clean and comfortable! I would recommend The Sylvan Guest House for anyone wanting somewhere affordable to stay in New York! Also I had friends over and they didn't want to leave.....Try it for yourself!!!"
7,1967,"Jul 20 2009 	WONDERFUL	The Sylvan Guest House was wonderful, my family and I stayed for 7 days and is was everything and more than what we expected. The house looked exactly as the pictures in the internet which of course is the main concern of anyone traveling to any new place, but the size, service and commodities were absolutely wonderful. Julio was very cordial and needless to say the house was clean and in great conditions.I would recommend it to any big family wanting to go to NY is more conftable than a Hotel."
8,1967,"Jul 20 2009 	We highly recommend the Sylvan Guest House	My family (three kids - 8, 11 and 14) had a very pleasant stay at the Sylvan Guest House. We were very pleased with the historical value of the house and its very interesting and safe environment.Having a metro stop nearby and a grocery store around the corner was also a great benefit to us.Julio helped to have our car parked close by with no problems on this end.We were very comfortable and were able to host our family members for two evenings here. They were also impressed at the beauty of the place.I have no reservations in recommending the Sylvan Guest House based on our stay."
9,1967,"Jul 19 2009 	Wonderful place in New York city	We stayed 4 days with my wife at 12 Sylvan Terrace, New York City. What a fantastic place!!Clean, spacious, wonderful neighborhood close the Jumel Mansion the oldest house in Manhattan (Built in 1776). It began as Colonial Roger Morris's &quot;Gentleman's Farm&quot; in colonial New York. It served as a Revolutionary War headquarters to General Washington in September and October of 1776. If you want feel you are in New York this is the place."
10,1967,"Jul 2 2009 	dangerous area	close to the bronx, I didnt feel myself secure. At night do not even try to go out!the pictures of the apartment have nothing to do with the real ones... Extremly expensive.Far away from downtown... taxi cost me 30 USD."
11,1967,"Mar 6 2009 	exquisitely designed townhouse	As a born and raised New Yorker and a longtime resident of Washington Heights, it was heartbreaking for me to have to give up my apartment in the neighborhood after living and loving it there for so many years. Coming upon Julio and Kenza's exquisitely designed townhouse and the historical haven of Sylvan Terrace is among the best treasures I could have ever found. The two floor, 2 bathroom, 2 bedroom, office loft with brand new modern kitchen and baths and a charming deck has become among my favorite places to land when I come home."
1,1969,"Beautiful classy hotel	We booked this hotel in June for November and had not read any TripAdvisor reviews. After reading some particularyly disturbing stories of shabby bedrooms and poor service and even ladies of the night going about their business in the hotel I would have been tempted to book elsewhere but my friend had paid in full when she booked so this was not an option. I received an e mail from hilton concierge services prior to our departure and replied by telling them that I was concerned about the standard of the rooms after reading some bad reviews and requested a refurbished room. I recieved a reply stating that my request had been noted and if a refurbished room was available at the time of check in they would comply with my request. On arrival we checked in two hours early to be told that our room was ready and we went straight up to the 12th floor. Our room was absolutely fine and clean overlooking a very quiet courtyard so I was extremely relieved! We explored the public areas of the hotel which are absolutely beautiful . This is a really impressive hotel with a fascinating history. Everyone in the hotel was more than helpful , the service from all the staff was first class and we could not have asked for more. The barman mixed me a cocktail which was delicious nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff anywhere in the hotel. As this trip was a 50th birthday present from my friend to me the hotel put a bottle of sparking wine and a lovely welcome letter in our room which was a very considerate touch. In conclusion I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone. We had a lovely time here and would return in the future."
2,1969,"I wouldn't put my dog here	Was offered a &quot;luxury suite&quot; to compensate for previously very substandard accommodations e.g. peeling paint (probably lead), unclean room, furniture missing parts, etc. Some of the pictures already on the site pretty much tell the story. The &quot;luxury&quot; suite was nothing like their brochures would have you believe. Old 60's era furniture, utterly unclean. The kitchenette still had spilled coffee from the previous occupant and the stove? Didn't look like it had been cleaned in years. Grunge and leftover food. It was downright gross. Ruined my anniversary."
3,1969,"Nov 24 2009	Perfect choice saving already to go back!	Lived up to our expectations!Staff were very friendly and most helpful.We had a room on 14th floor with 2 double beds overlooking Park Ave.It wasnt ready when we arrived so we were given a Voucher for 2 drinks!Only thing missing, as in most NY Hotels, was the kettle and tea/coffee.They need to take a leaf out of our N. Ireland Hotels&amp;Guesthouses.You MUST try Waldorf Sunday Brunch, expensive but worth it! It is a perfect base for sightseeing and shopping.We walked to Battery Park so wear comfy shoes.Took Staten Island Ferry (free) at sunset and views were spectacular!Breakfast at the Rock Center Cafe was exceptional-we had a table right beside the Ice Rink.So was our meal in Benihana.Smith and Wollensky was also worth the money.They are all just a few minutes walk away. Go to Top of Rock early in the day to avoid queues-views breathtaking.Buy a map for 2$ so you know what you are looking at and go RIGHT TO THE TOP.Bryant Park worth a visit - Christmas Market and Ice Skating in a lovely setting.Times Square on a Sunday afternoon has to be seen to be believed!Cant wait to return.Didnt have time to revisit Central Park but enjoyed walk by East River in the sun."
4,1969,"Nov 23 2009 	distinguished manhattan hotel - needs some updating	Stayed in one bedroom suite, which was pretty big (not just by NYC standards either) first, the bad:Bathroom had very little counter space, just the sides od the sink and the bathroom itself was small considering the size of the room. Definitely too small for two people to be in at once. The shower curtain doesnt stay totally shut and water was all over the floor everytime I showered.The paint in the room (esp. near the windows) was warped, chipped and the wood exposed.I dont think the a/c in either room worked properly. it was set to 65, i left the room for a few hours, and when i returned it was still balmy. It was on, i could hear it, but cold air (even cool air) wasnt coming from either unit.Had cocktails at peacock alley and while they were friendly, the service was SO slow. it wasnt even very busy (it was much later than chocktail hour &amp; dinner) and even having our waters refilled or getting a second glass of wine took so long, we just decided to leave early.The good: even though the hotel was busy (they said it was booked at full capacity) check-in was quick and efficient and the clerk was very friendly. the location of the hotel was perfect for me - i had a meetings at a building mere steps away and there's great shopping just a few blocks away.the room was huge, both the bedroom and the living area. the flat panel tv's are big too. i dont think there was much &quot;hallway traffic&quot; but i never heard anyone walking by or any of my neighbours through the walls.had dinner at bull &amp; bear with a girlfriend and everything was fantastic - the service, atmosphere (very busy for a weeknight at 10) drinks &amp; wine and the meal itself! there were a lot of, er, questionable looking ladies there and it was certainly entertaining to see them in action loloverall this is a nice hotel - a manhattan classic - but it does need some updating. i will absolutely stay here again because of its location"
5,1969,"Nov 21 2009 	NYC Icon 	Beautiful hotel in a great location. The hotel has the history and finesse for New York City. Guest rooms are small, which is to be expected in such a large city. The carpet is very worn would be the only downside. The bathroom was beautiful. Sunday brunch is $95/person."
6,1969,"Nov 19 2009 	Not up to scratch	First thing to note is that this doesn't act like a Hilton Hotel, so your diamond loyalty cards etc count for very little. We did manange to persuade them to give us breakfast in the Towers lounge but the regular off er was a voucher for StarbucksRooms are tired but large with the most revolting toiletries! Marzipan soap and clove shower gel! There is a large discrepency btw the room choices so do ask to be moved if you are not happy. We found service to be very patchy but if you were pesistent and got the right person, they were willing to help.The location is outstanding and worth a lot. The public areas of the hotel are beautiful and interesting - you are staying at an historic place. There is a poor level of communication regarding hotel facilities. We were told Oscar's brasserie was open when it obviously wasn't etc. Do check if you are planning to eat at a particular restaurant.To sum up; not bad but could be so much better."
7,1969,"Nov 18 2009 	nice hotel but not worth the money	we are just home from our stay in waldorf astoria, had been reading the mixed reviews prior to our trip so decided to post my own review, check in was slow enough we arrived at 2pm and despite an early check in request we had to wait until 3pm,i know it is only one hour but i did request it at booking as ia m 7 months pregnant and knew i'd be tired and also other people were checking in around the same time. As everyone else has been saying the main areas of the hotel are very grand and expensive, but the rooms do not reflect this at all, they are in serious need of refurbisment, although clean the bathroom was dissapointing. tiles coming away from the wall and grout all discoloured, curtains in bedroom were a little grubby. I wouldn,t normally be so picky but when paying these prices i expected a little more for my money even with new york standards. Would not stay here again there are better hotels to stay in for less money."
8,1969,"Nov 18 2009 	Stay somewhere else	First the positive notes: Can't beat the location. If you like a historical hotel, this one has a romantic history. Other than that...On their website, they offer an uprade (certainly not for free) if you request one. We requested a one bedroom suite on the Concierge floor. We were told that the website was wrong and that was not an upgrade. We were disappointed, but accepted a one bedroom suite in the main hotelDo not depend on the concierge service. I e-mailed them prior to our arrival to book a reservation at a nearby restaurant. I didn't hear back from them. When checking in, the gentleman at the reception desk said he would get back to me, which he did, saying there was no record of my e-mail and they'd be happy to make a reservation if I called them back. I called the concierge desk, who knew nothing about this, and the woman said she would get back to me. She didn't. Later that evening I spoke in person to one of the concierges who finally booked our reservation. When asking for directions to The Boathouse in Central Park, I was told it was &quot;very touristy&quot; and handed directions - which were wrong. Had we depended on our own map, we could easily have saved an hour's walk. We found the Boathouse, and thought it to be delightful and high end.Breakfast. We were only there for 2 days, so I cannot recommend an alternate, but you are virtually held prisoner if you wish to eat at your own hotel. The first morning, we had to line up for almost 45 minutes before we were seated. Continental Buffet: $32 Full Breakfast Buffet: $38 Excuse me, but if I'm paying $38 for breakfast, why am I making my own toast?? The cheapest item on the menu was an $8 bagel. It is overpriced and the buffet is sub-par with very runny scrambled eggs and rubber potatoes. The next morning, we lined up once again, and were asked if we had a reservation! For breakfast in OUR OWN HOTEL? Outrageous.If you have an endless budget, and can stay in the Boutique part of this hotel, then by all means, stay here. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
9,1969,"Nov 17 2009 	A Step back in time without loss of service	A fabulous hotel, beautifully presented, a step back in time to an era of luxury and style. Helpful, pleasant staff, delicious food, central to everything and a lovely retreat from the bustling, lively city f New York,"
10,1969,"Nov 17 2009 	PERFECT!	I had the perfect stay at the Waldorf Astoria. From the minute we checked in till we left everything went smooth.We were checked in at a private office: no standing in line. The room we booked wasn't available but they immediately upgraded us to an other room. Once in the room we got a phonecall to check if everything was in order and as we wished and if we needed anything else.The hotel itself is GORGEOUS!! Even if you're not staying there, you should go and see it. Beautiful detailing in the floor, the ceiling, elevator doors, ... even the public bathroom is to die for.The food is excellent (a bit pricy though), the sunday brunch lavish.The staff is verry helpfull.Our room was spotless every day!At night it was suprisingly noisy in our room, I'm not sure if it was the traffic or the AC, but then again it's NYC, not the Adirondacks.Ok, the carpet in the hallways has seen better days and should be renovated allong with a couple of things here and there, but nothing major.And it has a great location.I would definitely go there again."
11,1969,"Nov 16 2009 	Unmissable experience	Stayed at Waldorf Astoria with mother and sister form the time we arrived and were escorted from car to lobby we were treated with courtesy and politeness. It did not matter if you were in jeans or furs guests are guests.We did have a room upgrade so it as large enough for all 3 of us-although the access to the closet was restricted by 1 of the beds,Beds,pillows and duvet soft and comfortable,daily change of linen and towels too.The room was very warm and the windows did not open and the heating/cooling system a bit outdated and inefficient.Eating and drinking at the hotel v.expensive even the &quot;Inhouse&quot; Starbucks was 50% more expensive than outside-there is one around the corner on 50th and Lexington.But it is in a great locationand to sit in the front lobby and watch the coming and goings of all sorts of guests is not to be missed.It is a bit faded but the old glory still evident."
12,1969,"Nov 14 2009 	Classy hotel that lives upto its reputation	Enjoyed a wonderful time in this classic hotel, staff were exceptional with any requests dealt with immediately and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. restaurants were expensive but the food was of the highest order and worth the cost. Try the steaks in the Bull and Bear, they are fantastic."
13,1969,"Nov 12 2009 	Great experience - will be back	This is a stunning art deco hotel in a great location  within walking distance of 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Central Park and Macys. The bedrooms are not up to the same decorative standard as the public spaces (that would be hard) but we had a spacious comfortable room for three. The staff were fantastic  friendly and courteous. Cleaning staff are constantly on duty throughout the hotel and pay great attention to detail. The restaurants in the hotel are a little pricey - we werent keen on Peacock Alley but Oscars was a real treat for breakfast and the steaks in the Bull &amp; Bear were delicious! It was a real pleasure staying in a hotel so full of history  well definitely be back!"
14,1969,"Nov 11 2009 	Still has its charme!	Last March after a not-so-good stay at the Westin New York @ Times Square, decided to stay our last nights at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. At check-in were upgraded to one of their One Bedroom Suites who really have the nice, classic, luxurious fibe the hotel is known for. The breakfast vouchers for Starbucks in the hotel were not so special, but for the rest the hotel is really undescribly beautiful!"
15,1969,"Nov 5 2009	Everything we expected and more!	Before this visit, I last stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria in May 2007. On both visits, I was given a large, clean comfortable room. The staff was helpful and efficient. Room service was prompt, housekeeping was diligent, and the front desk and business center staff handled every request promptly and correctly. Everything was absolutely perfect and I have no complaints at all.Well, just one. Don't try to take the elevators between 11:30 and noon, when everyone's trying to check out. The location is perfect; just far enough away from 5th Avenue that it's not really noisy at night, but close enough to walk to a lot of major attractions. There's also a subway station right across the street."
16,1969,"Nov 2 2009 	Classic New York Hotel	A beautiful hotel, loved the lobby, ballroom, atmosphere and breakfast."
17,1969,"Oct 27 2009 	Dirty old bedrooms in need of a refurb.	I picked this hotel as a family break. The foyer of the hotel is grand, the checkin is slow and poor. When we were given the keys to our two rooms and went up in the lift as we got to our floor WHAT a come down. It was like a 1930s bed and breakfast. The paint was dull the paper was hanging off the wall the bed was dirty and the bathroom was old and dirty. I complained to reception but the staff did not want to know. After a lot of shouting we did get moved, but these were in a no better state. I would not recomend this hotel."
18,1969,"Oct 25 2009 	Decrepit suite	I could not believe our suite. I made reservations 2 months in advance and requested a large suite. Our suite was large, but that was it. It had 2 1980 TV's, no flat screen, When I complained, they put in flat screens, but they did not work. The electrical work in the room needs upgrading. The bathroom tiles were coming apart, the shower looked like a motel 6. We are still in New York, but have since moved to the Pierre. The management here really does not know how to run a hotel. I was disgusted."
19,1969,"Oct 23 2009 	Perfect Location	The Waldorf Astoria lives up to it's reputation as a world renowned hotel. From the moment you enter the hotel you are aware of the service that you will receive. The rooms are lovely with city views and offer everything that you could possibly require. The decor had a traditional English vibe which I loved. The main pro of this hotel is it's location which is in easy walking distance of Grand Central Station, Central Park, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. The Waldorf Astoria is well worth paying for. Pure luxury! The starbucks in the lobby entrance was another bonus for me and went in there every morning. I did not have the chance to try it but so many other guests recommended the Sunday Brunch so I would definitely sample that if I went back. Service was fantastic from the check in desk to the doormen. Ignore all negative reviews and stay at the Waldorf!"
20,1969,"Oct 22 2009 	Old world elegance with modern conveniences	I travel to New York frequently on business and stay at the Waldorf as often as possible. The rooms are quite spacious (especially by New York standards!), well decorated, and comfortable. I adore the food---the cheesecake is not to be missed--and the service is top notch. A few months back, room service somehow lost my order; within minutes of realizing their mistake, the Waldorf had sent up the kitchen manager to personally apologize and our entire meal was comped (with extras thrown in). Overall, one of my favorites in New York."
21,1969,"Oct 22 2009 	Very Disappointing	We booked the Waldorf Astoria in New York for 4 nights on the last leg of a family holiday to America after researching the hotel website and in particular the guest rooms which looked lovely in the photos and were described as &quot;luxurious guest rooms&quot;. They were also described as &quot;cheerful bedrooms with oversized marble bathrooms which give our rooms a delightful ambience&quot;.We arrived late on the Sunday evening, checked in and then went down to one of the restaurants in the hotel for a meal which was extremely pricey (as we expected) but some of the restaurant staff were almost to the point of being rude - not the &quot;unparelled hospitality and service&quot; promised on the hotels website.On returning back to our room we did notice that it looked a little bit tired but as we wanted to make the most of New York's sights we only really used our room for sleeping and bathing until our last day when we spent some time in the room packing and that was when we started noticing things. For example, the net curtain at the window was flithy, the valances on the bed had holes in and were stained, paint was peeling off in the bathroom, the sealant was hanging off over the bath/shower, the toilet seat was loose (you had to be careful how you positioned yourself when you sat on it!) and the vent in the bathroom was full of dirt which must have taken months to accumulate.There were 10 of us in our party which meant we had booked 5 rooms for 4 nights each which we had booked and paid for 5 months in advance. At the time of booking we had also upgraded the rooms. I'm sure there are some nice rooms in the hotel - apparently the President stays at the Waldorf in the Presidential Suite when he goes to New York so I'm assuming that's quite a nice room! - but unfortunately it would seem that none of our party had a nice room as on our return and discussing the hotel it appeared that there were similar problems in all the rooms. My sister in law wouldn't even put her bare feet on the carpet in her room as it seemed so dirty and these were the upgraded rooms - what would we have got if we hadn't upgraded???When you arrive at the hotel and go into the main reception you are struck by the elegance and opulence as with most of the main areas of the hotel but unfortunately this didn't continue through to the guest rooms we were allocated. This was the third hotel we stayed in on our trip to America and we didn't have any issues with the other two hotels we stayed in (the first in San Francisco and the second in Las Vegas) neither of which have the reputation that the Waldorf Astoria has. Unfortunately that seems to be what the hotel is trading in on - its past reputation as it definitely didn't live up to our expectations and we certainly wouldn't return."
22,1969,Oct 21 2009 	The Worst Stay Ever And I Have Traveled The World	NO room ready after travel from Europe and made a special request for an early check in months in advance. Told to change in the public bathroom off the lobby to reach walking clothes and shoes. An abrupt angry black man at the concierge desk told us to change now or he was taking our luggage..NOW! So we flung it open in the lobby and changed shoes and what have you there!! How crude and how rude..and this was supposed to be a luxury hotel..Our room ..at the farthest end of the hallways with a city view was a wall. When our luggage was brought up to our room the sandwiches we had purchased prior to check in were gone. So we hope whoever ate them enjoyed our lunches. The tub was almost completely plugged and the permanent ring on the tub belied that it always ran that slow. We took showers standing in each others shower water. Managment said we should have called them and they would have sent up a plumber to fix it. IF THE PHONE WAS WORKING...we may have called..but also We came back to our room at midnight and had an early check out to fly out of NY. Was a plumber going to be working into the morning hours while we sat on our beds in this tiny cramped room and waited to shower??? we had to wait for a room..now this too?? My friends from Europe said it best at the impression left by this American luxury hotel staff...I always thought Americans were very proper and professional. I see now they are not.&quot; I cannot tell you how embarrassing that was and remains.. That first impression can never be removed...and to think it happened at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC on Park Avenue....for shame.
23,1969,"Oct 20 2009 	Excellent Room	Stayed on the 7th floor, Park Ave side and found the room to be spotless. Could be the room has been redone lately as it had a flat screen TV and was in excellent condition. Have stayed here in the past and have always had a great room. It was a business trip but the location has always been perfect for walking to the theater, Rock-center, shopping etc. Lobby was always busy and check in took longer then we liked but it is a large hotel."
24,1969,"Oct 20 2009 	outstanding	I met my best friend and her parents in NY in the middle of my tour across Canada and stayed in this amazing hotel! First time in new york, amazing location with a starbucks restaurant and bar in the hotel and a few minutes walk from times square this is definitely a great choice. very spacious bedrooms with ensuite, lcd tv, radio/alarm :) I would definitely recommend"
25,1969,"Oct 18 2009 	Resting on its laurels	I'm afraid our stay at the Waldorf was very much marked by our check-in experience. I booked and paid for a superior king room 6 months before our arrival. We checked in at 7pm. The receptionist found our booking and quickly allocated our room. However, when she handed us the keys, she quickly mentioned our &quot;Queen room&quot;. We pointed out that we had booked a King room.She looked slightly ashamed and went back to her computer and found us a king room.At that point, we reminded her that we had booked a king superior room. At that point, she admitted that they had no king superior rooms left. She could not explain why our room had been allocated. She could not upgrade our room and could only offer us the king deluxe.She then tried to palm us off by saying that there was no difference in the deluxe and superior rooms save for size. So why charge so much more for the deluxe then?!She then offered us a $50 credit if we would stay in the deluxe room. When I protested further, she said that she would upgrade our room on the second day of our stay.I know it may sound I'm whinging when we got a $50 credit and then an upgrade for the remainder of our stay. However, we very much felt that the Waldorf tried to pull a fast one. Rather than being upfront about the overbooking, it tried to give us an inferior room to the one we booked. It wasn't until we pushed hard that we reached a compromise. The hotel never apologise. I have left it two weeks since completing its questionnaire and making these points, but it hasn't responded to me.We weren't the only ones to have this problem - the guy next to us in the check in queue was being given the same treatment.We were allocated a small suite for our second night onwards. Very nice sized room with a sofa, desk and flat screen tv. A lovely touch is the digital radio alarm clock. The bed was comfy save for the pillows which were way too soft for our UK taste.On the downside, the rooms are quite dark. The bathrooms are in desperate need of updating - the paper was peeling from the walls, the water took an age to heat up, the bath is very shallow and the shower was just a showerhead fixed to the wall rather than on a riser rail.The main parts of the hotel are beautiful but other less public areas seem to need a real good clean and spruce up. The decor can be &quot;olde worlde&quot; but clean at the same time!We found service in the bars very slow and not good quality. The drinks are extremely expensive. Go across 50th to the old church for better service and quality. Food too is over priced - if you want steak, go to Smith + Wollensky which is on Lexington and 49th.The lady who reports on the problems with prostitues is right! Whilst we didn't have the disruption that she did, the hotel bars are used by hookers to pick up hotel guests. This is tolerated by the hotel. The practice isn't blatant, but you can spot it a mile off!"
26,1969,"Oct 16 2009 	Stay from Hell	My Auntie and I stayed for 3 nights at the Waldorf and it was terrible.The room was very grand, beds were lovely, service was good but we could not sleep due to the people in the next room. After talking to one of the sales assistants at Saks - I realised what was going on next door!!!!! The Waldorf allows Call Girls in to guest's rooms - each night we were awoken to the couple's screams, the headboard banging against our bedroom wall and then the hotel slamming as the Call Girl finished her business. It was a nightmare. We did complain after we had checked out - the manager did not want to know. Would never ever stay there again."
27,1969,"Oct 15 2009 	amazing hotel clean 	stayed for one night - had an amazing time. it was an anniversary. rooms were clean and beautiful, and the staff was absolutely helpful . would definitly recommend you stay here if coming to NY!"
28,1969,"Oct 15 2009 	Good value and service but in need of updating	I booked a suite for a two night stay and was pleasantly surprised by an upgrade to a one bedroom with a foyer, huge living room, and bathroom. The room had very good bones (super high ceilings, nice mouldings), but it really needs new decor. The bathroom was very old and small. The toilet paper dispenser was rusty, the paint was chipping off the door moulding, etc. The good news is that at $465/night, it was a relatively good deal in NYC, but we would not have been happy if we had not received the upgrade to the huge 1 BR. Room service was alarmingly expensive ($25 for a steak sandwich) but the service overall was excellent and attentive. The dark lobby where checkin takes place is outdated an in dire need of a renovation. I will say, however, that if the place were renovated, the prices would skyrocket to St. Regis heights. Overall, I thought it was a good value for NYC."
29,1969,"Oct 13 2009 	Saddened at the performance of an iconic historical hotel.	My husband &amp; I have stayed before &amp; I loved every moment we shared at the hotel including the restaurants. This time, the rooms were dirty, the service was slow, the food was marginal and the drinks were poor. We were very disappointed. We will not be back."
30,1969,"Oct 13 2009 	Beautiful hotel	This is a beautiful hotel with a perfect location if you are visiting New York! Walking distance or a short cab ride to all the attractions: Financial District, Island boat ride, SoHo, Madison Ave.,St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc. Accomodations were nice and service was good."
31,1969,"Oct 13 2009 	stay here if you can afford it	We nearly didn't stay at the Waldorf because of some of the reviews on trip advisor and what a mistake that would have been. Ditto for Raffles in Singapore. Forgive my rave, but either some people like to whinge or they only look at the negatives. So what if something tiny sometimes goes wrong. Get over it and enjoy everything else. These are grand old hotels and an experience that you should have if you can afford it. Anyone can stay at run-of-the-mill five-star hotel, but these places are truly different. I've been meaning to write something here for a long time because staying at the Waldorf was so much fun and there are so many poor reviews below. Ignore them and give it a go."
32,1969,"Oct 12 2009 	Find someplace else to stay	I've stayed at the Waldorf for over 30 years and this stay was heartbreaking! They have cut their staff and quality to what you would expect from a Motel 8. Our room was dirty and dusty, the glass had enough dust to write your name on it. The once superb linen has been replaced with cheap linen and the pillows are nothing but air! The Bull and Bear was way-over-priced for the portion and quality of the food. When I spoke to the limo drivers, most said they have heard the same complaints from other people who stayed there recently. It's too bad to see such a wonderful place go from the top to the bottom in such a short amount of time! I strongly suggest you try the old Meat Packing District or any one of the other hotels in NYC"
33,1969,"Oct 12 2009 	Old time elegance with modern day appeal	My first trip to New York ended off with a stay at the Waldorf Astoria just after getting engaged and our stay at this famous landmark hotel was the perfect way to end off a perfect trip. Our room was lovely and the view of Park Avenue with it's beautifully decorated trees all the way down the avenue was amazing. I highly suggest the sunday brunch at the Peacock Lounge, it is the best brunch I have ever had anywhere and have never experienced anything like it since. Check-in was quick and efficient, even though there were long queues due to it being a very busy time of year. On the day of check out, they kindly held on to our bags in order for us to take in some last minute sight-seeing. We returned to The Waldorf for a second stay in February of 2007 and we weren't dissapointed, everything was just as great as the first time around. Just a tip, request your transfer driver/taxi driver, to drop you off at the &quot;check-in&quot; entrance, and not at the front of the hotel in Park Avenue, as you have to drag your bag up the stairs and through the foyer to get to the check-in counter. If you arrive at the hotel guest check-in entrance, the concierge marks your bag and stores it, and by the time you have checked-in and get to your room, your bags are already waiting for you. The doormen also went the extra mile, hailing cabs for guests, and even asked us where we were going and told the cab driver where to take us. The doorman even called Madison Square Garden for us to check what time the game started! Compared to other five-star hotels in the city, I feel The Waldorf offers way more value for money...they just don't make them like this anymore!"
34,1969,"Oct 11 2009 	Beautiful and Romantic	A truly wonderful experience. Lots of shopping, great food and wine..right around every corner. Beautiful rooms comfy beds~"
35,1969,"Oct 11 2009 	Not worth it. Hiding behind its brand name..	Having traveled to Waldorf with an expectation of comfort and luxury, I was definitely surprised with the ordinary room (not even have a flat screen). The room needs a renovation urgently. The hotel is everything except an elegant hotel. The lobby is like New York Penn Station. In the lobby you have to wait at least for 25 minutes for just a cup of coffee. This hotel needs a complete renovation like the Plaza. They cannot hide behind its legacy any more. For sure this was the first and last time I will stay over there. Only positive side was the hotel's location. just two blocks from Saks 5th."
36,1969,"Oct 9 2009 	Nice but over rated	Beautiful lobby but very crowded and noisy. Took over 30 mins to get our luggage to our room. The rooms were small and the curtains( sheers) in our room were dirty, black at the bottom. We had a view of the a/c unit. At the price we paid we should have had at least a view of the street. The bartenders at Peacock Alley were great and very attentive. I would not stay here again. The attached steak house was way overpriced and the food was marginal. My chair was broken and when I asked for a new one the waiter took the broken one put it at another table and gave me a new one..I would hope that some one else did not have the misfortune of sitting in the same broken chair."
37,1969,"Oct 9 2009 	The Waldorf Astoria is a fabulous hotel!	From the moment we stepped out of the cab the service was first class. Gus, the doorman, was so friendly and funny. All the people there were warm and helpful. The room we got was bigger than I expected and the beds were comfortable. The hotel lives up to its name... Grand, elegant, first class service. My friends and I never ate there because the restaurants are overpriced(especially room service). However, this was not a problem because there are so many places to eat there. Go to the Starbucks on the right side of the hotel. You'll pay half the price compared to the one in the hotel. I would definitely stay here again!!!!"
38,1969,"Oct 8 2009 	Wonderful 16th Birthday Celebration at the Waldorf	I recently treated my daughter to a fabulous stay at the Waldorf Astoria for her 16th Birthday! It was a magical place for her to turn 16, the hotel staff treated us like royalty! The hotel room was beautiful and we had an excellent view of New York City. The location of the hotel made it easy for us to get around the whole city. I would strongly recommend staying there to anyone, especially if you are traveling in this city without a man. We felt very safe in this hotel."
39,1969,"Oct 8 2009 	Old World Elegance	My daughter really wanted me to stay here and against my wishes, I did. It was a truly wonderful experience - sort of a throw back to the old days of luxury and service. My room happened onto a rooftop area overlooking Park Avenue and I enjoyed watching Park Avenue come alive in the morning. Everyone, from the doormen to the housekeeping staff was wonderfully friendly, albeit a little formal, and I truly enjoyed my stay here."
40,1969,"Oct 8 2009 	Not quite what we were hoping for	We stayed in the Waldorf Towers section of the Waldorf=Astoria for a couple nights in early August and were pretty disappointed with our experience.Although the main lobby is beautiful, when you get up to your floor, the hallways are UNBELIEVABLY dated and the carpeting smells like it hasn't been replaced in decades.Sadly, the room wasn't much better. The whole place needs an overhaul, and given the prices they ask (which thankfully wasn't as bad for us because we used points), the guests deserve better.Additionally, continental breakfast was included with the Waldorf Towers, but the room in which it is served is pathetic. Loud window units provide the air conditioning, and the service leaves much to be desired -- At one point I had the pleasure of listening to the manager actually yelling at one of her team. Do we really need to see/hear this kind of thing?"
41,1969,"Oct 8 2009 	Its worth it for the History	We visted New York in June of this year for my wife's 40th birthday, and as a surprise I booked the Waldorf Astoria. On arrival she was delighted with the choice, and proceeded to look at the historic pictures etc, the reception was excellent and so efficient. We were allocated a corner room overlooking Park Avenue and the church etc, it was huge, with the comfiest bed ever. It is an experience to stay at the Waldorf, and we had a good time just wandering around the place looking at the pictures etc.Its not cheap, but you wouldn't expect that we had a few drinks in the hotel and ordered breakfast in the room on my wife's birthday (110) but if you can stay there once, it is worth it just for the experience."
42,1969,"Oct 6 2009 	Great location	We stayed at this hotel 2 days during our honeymoon.The staff at reception gave us a free upgrade to the tower as we were honeymooners :-) Great start!The free morning buffet in the tower is okay, but nothing extreordinary - but hey it's free.Great location but maybe not the best value for money. I think you pay lots of money for the brand of the Waldorf Astoria."
43,1969,"Oct 5 2009 	Great Dissapointment	I travelled with my sister to NY and we spend two days in the worldwide-famous Hotel Astoria, as was my sister &quot;Dream of her life&quot;. The experience was disappointing from begonning to the end: long waiting upon check in, the rooms (we booked superiour!) were in quite bad conditions (bathroom forniture with cello-tape!) and not really clean (specially the bathroom), the lady who made the turndown service came in and out without doing anything at all, during breakfast we had to leave our table to go back to reception to ask for some &quot;breakfast vouchers&quot; we never been told about. Upon departure we had to go to pick our luggage ourselfs... We wrote a letter to the management leaving our contact details and they never got back to us..."
44,1969,"Oct 5 2009 	Best hotel ever	best hotel ever, just like a dream... what a room!"
45,1969,"Oct 5 2009 	Old tired hotel rooms badly in need of upgrading	Arrival - I was on transit in NYC on 22nd Aug 2009 so only stayed a night. If it's any longer, I wld definitely have changed hotel. It was past 1am when I arrived at the hotel. When the taxi drove up at the hotel driveway, it was &quot;under&quot; the hotel. A little uncomfortable for me, a lady traveler as I need to take a &quot;dated&quot; elevator alone to the hotel lobby. The hotel lobby is probably the most impressive area.Check-in - A'lthou it was at such early hr, there's a queue of abt 5~6pax waiting for check-in. I was tired but was told that only smoking rooms are left although I have asked for a non-smoking one at reservations. I agreed wit the other advisors that some of the service staff is v rude. The statement to me put plainly was &quot;our hotel is full, if u dont want the room, fine, there are others waiting in queue.&quot; I left the queue to rest out my frustrations. I re-queued &amp; pleaded wit another staff that it's simply too much for me, a lady to wander the street at such hour to look for another hotel. After much hassle &amp; talking to his manager, he managed to get me a non-smoking room. By the time I checked in, OMG, it was 2.30am!Room - As expected, it's dated. The windows look into the air-well so there ain't much to see. It has a stale smell, the TV is a huge boxed-up type, &amp; u will be given a key to open the fridge. Theres no complimentary bottled water so if u think u will not be used to drinking tap water, make sure u buy a bottle fr the airport before heading to the hotel. Considering the room rate, bedroom slipper is not provided so rem to bring your own.Bathroom - Very small wit boxed-up mirror like those in see in the movies in the 60's. There is simply no space at the wash basin to put my personal items. After my late shower, I searched high &amp; low for the hairdryer in the bathroom &amp; the dresser table without much success &amp; decided to go to bed wit my semi-wet hair. The next morning, I found it hanging on the side wall of the walk-in closet. At least cotton wool/pad &amp; cotton bud is provided. My experience wit US hotels is that they dun provide tooth brush or tooth paste so do rem to bring your own. I hope someone is reading tis - wit the strict no water/gel rule on the air planes, it wld help if tooth brush n paste are provided.Food - After a long night, (or was that early morning?), I had brkf at the Oscars. It was terribly expensive. An American brkf - toast, two eggs cooked at your choice wit either ham OR bacon OR sausage, a cup of juice &amp; a cup of coffee OR tea cost US$28 without tax. And its not even buffet style. I know tis is NYC but must it be that expensive?? I had lunch at the Pier which is reasonably priced. I also found a Metro cafe very near to the hotel where u can have cheaper toast, cakes &amp; coffee. Beds - good enough for a night's rest.Check-out - again long queue. Either the hotel is badly under-staffed or is really really v busy.All said, tis hotel has definitely seen better days. It is also within walking distance to tourist attractions &amp; the sub-way. But for the $, I suggest u do more homework &amp; consult wit more advisors to check out other hotels nearby."
46,1969,"Sep 27 2009 	Old Class Style	Stayed there for three nights during a conference. While i much prefer the style of a new property, it was a nice treat to experience a taste of the old luxury. While the hotel was clean, it still felt very old... (old furnishings, smell, etc). I think if they maybe updated the hotel, and furnishings, i'd be more likely to return. Overall, service was very good, location was great and the food was delicious."
47,1969,"Sep 27 2009 	Truly horrible....will never return	I stayed here many years ago (2000) as a treat for my mother's birthday and it was absolutely wonderful. I've been back once since then in 2003 and it was clear things were heading downhill. However, this year my mother and I were returning to New York and she asked if we could stay at the hotel once more. Since I'd read that Hilton were introducing the Waldorf-Astoria Collection I (wrongly) assumed they would have invested in their flagship hotel. Not the case, check in was dreadful and we were given a single room. I complained by calling down from the room and was told by the reception manager that she was too busy to deal with me or my complaint. I went down to reception and threatened to make a fuss in the lobby if something wan't sorted and they found us a larger room, but still not the one I'd booked. We were there during labour day weekend for the US Open tennis and the hotel was packed. Clearly customer service had gone out the window. The new room was much larger but horribly old, tired and dirty. It even verged on the dangerous as the carpet was so threadbare that both my mother and I slipped over on it several times. Nothing has been updated or changed since our original stay in 2000. All the flower arrangements have been removed and even the carpets in the public spaces are dirty. Such a shame for a once fabulous grande dame. The only saving grace is that the beds are still comfortable. However, I doubt Hilton have any plans to change those either so presumably the only positive factor will be gone in a couple of years time. The service is laughable....after the mix up with the rooms, we were promised an additional foldaway bed which never arrived and then a complimentary bottle of cheap champagne was delivered to our room in apology....except that it wasn't for us. My mother and I were addressed as Mr and Mrs...when we queried this the poor confused chap simply picked up the tray and walked back out of the room with it. So dreadful it was actually funny... I filled in a feedback form but am not suprised that I've heard nothing from Hilton. Stay away....I hear the Kitano is a much better option, especially if cleanliness is high on your list of priorities."
48,1969,"Sep 27 2009 	Wonderful Experience at the Waldorf Towers	This hotel is truly you get what you pay for. Our last visit we got a good price on a room in the regular part of the hotel. It was a great room, but right in line with what we paid. This visit we decided to splurge and get a suite room in the Towers. The Towers is a hotel within the hotel and has a separate private lobby with check in and elevator. The room was about 3 times more than the rate we paid for the regular hotel, but it was worth it for us. For the reviewers complaining about dealing with lines and &quot;regular people&quot;at the hotel pay the extra money and stay on the Towers side. You can't choose their cheapest room and expect it to be on the same lines of those much more expensive. Our suite was extremely roomy and beautiful. The bathroom was gorgeous. The Tower's rooms include a continental breakfast that is excellent and well done. The staff was extremely helpful and there is never a wait for anything in the Towers lobby. The next time we go back to New York we will be staying at the Waldorf Towers, there is no other place like it.The only time we were not pleased was when we received very spotty and rude service Friday and Saturday evenings in the lobby bar the Peacock Alley. We were having pre out to dinner cocktails and we were ignored both evenings by both waiters. Our drinks were empty for over 10 minutes before they came back to offer another. Terrible for any place especially this one."
49,1969,"Sep 24 2009 	Old school style	We are both 25 and thought the WA might be a bit old school for us, which it actually is, but in a good way. Its old school luxury and has a great classic feel to it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants great service and a great location. We had a suite which had a huge living room, walk in wardrobe and massive bedroom. bathroom was a bit small compared to the rest of the suite but overall very clean and well presented."
50,1969,Sep 24 2009 	Very Grand - in great location	Beautiful hotel. As with most large hotels rather impersonnal. Our room was over looking the air-con machines so quite noisy. Room too hot but couldn't open the window!Can't really complain though as got an amazing on-line deal so excellent value whatever.Couldn't afford breakfast in the hotel but there was the usual Starbucks in the foyer - this seemed to be the most popular choise for many people staying at the hotel! Glad we stayed there.
51,1969,"Sep 24 2009 	The Old Lady Still Has Her Mojo	Are there likely better, nicer, more upscale hotels in 2009 in NYC? Sure. But few, if any, have the name Waldorf-Astoria. You can feel the history the moment you walk in the lobby and you realize that you are someplace special. The famed hotel still has its charm. The standard room was pleasant, decent size, and functional even if lacking the &quot;oh, wow&quot; atmosphere of the lobby. So close to so many sights and sounds of the Big Apple...St. Bart's Church, St. Patrick's Cathedral, shopping, and Times Square all within easy and safe walking distance. The service is first class. Recommend a nightcap in Harry's Bar off the lobby before you retire for the evening. With Frank Sinatra tunes playing softly in the background, you'd half excpect 'Ol Blue Eyes himself to come walking through the door. Room prices are very reasonable in this down economy and competitive lodging environment."
52,1969,"Sep 24 2009 	A memorable NYC experience	We decided to go to New York at the last minute and wanted to experience the city and its many treasures all in one weekend. The Waldorf was the perfect way to do it. We got a great deal through Travelocity. Our room was a little noisy because it was close to the elevators, but it was still luxurious and comfortable. Simply admiring the lobby and the reception, you feel like you have elegantly traveled back in time. My only regret would be ordering an $8 iced tea while having lunch at Oscar's; but I guess, that's just part of the NYC experience. Overall, I loved this hotel and its many amenities. I highly recommend it!"
53,1969,"Sep 22 2009 	Class is timeless	Hi,we had a wonderful few days at the Waldorf ,service as one would expect was superb,Toni[silver haired master of knowledge]knew everything about anything we needed to know or do,our room a superior on the 16th floor was excellent ,with 2 large beds and a superb large screen tv.We will definately be back."
54,1969,"Sep 20 2009 	Iconic hotel paid for the name	The original Waldorf Astoria was a glamorous place that was as gorgeous as one could expect. The Bull and Bear and Peacock Alley were ritzy and classy, but the rooms were not what one would expect for the price.My friends and I only stayed one night, so maybe we didn't have a chance to fully experience it, but we really didn't love the rooms. They were old and small. The AC didn't work, and someone had to come up to our rooms at 2AM to use a special wand to open the windows which only slightly helped. Of course, the rooms were very clean, but that was about it.I understand you are paying for the opportunity to say that you stayed at the Waldorf, and it was definitely worth it in that respect. We had lunch at the Peacock Alley, where our martinis cost more than our entrees. We had a couple of drinks at the Bull and Bear during happy hour and then came back with more friends at around midnight. They were great to us then, and we'd gladly go back for the Bull and Bear alone.Check in was a hassle, and our room wasn't ready until it was almost time for us to be at dinner, so that was inconvenient, and the line for checkout the next morning was long as well. Worst of all, the internet wasn't free!Overall, it was great to be able to stay in such an iconic location, but I probably wouldn't do it again. I'd rather spend the same amount for a larger room with a quieter atmosphere."
55,1969,"Sep 19 2009 	Fantastic iconic hotel in a great location	We had high expectations of the Waldorf Astoria and we were not disappointed. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite, which was very luxurious and huge. The room was beautifully furnished and very clean. Whilst the bathroom was fairly small in comparison to the room it provided everything you need.The hotel lobby and reception are very impressive and the levels of service from reception and concierge are very high.One word of warning... if you order room service the prices are ridiculous, being from the UK we are not used to all the extra service charges and had never had such an expensive fairly ordinary pizza!The location enabled us to walk to most areas of interest and there is a subway nearby if you are going slightly further. The hotel recommended a diner nearby (Comfort Diner) for breakfast, which we really enjoyed - huge portions and lots of choice."
56,1969,"Sep 18 2009 	A tired and depressing hotel worth avoiding	I stayed at the Waldorf for over a week on business and it was a rather depressing experience. It feels like a ballroom and conference facility with a few rooms attached above as an after thought. The level of staff service is terrible, some of them are quite simply rude. The rooms are well below the standard they should be for a hotel of this price: a little dirty and worn, pathetic TV and internet, poor bathroom, stale smell. The breakfast is lousy and overpriced, and the bar is ridiculously expensive. The location is obviously great though, and it is nice to be able to say you have stayed at the Waldorf, you just won't enjoy the experience very much at the time."
57,1969,"Sep 17 2009	Don't hesitate to stay at the Waldorf.	It is the great old lady of New York and one should stay there at least once. The Hotel is really great, the lobby is a time warp to a wonderful art deco past, it is warm and pleasant. The rooms are big and at times the view is simply spectacular. I find them very clean (been at the Waldorf 7 or 8 times) ,big, very smart and the Waldorf people are always eager to please their guest.It position is a very big plus as one is within walking distance from all major attractions and best shopping in town. The Bull and Bear and the Inagiku restaurants are good altho' expensive but i feel they worth it.If asked whether you would like to take the upgrade option do not hesitate!!!It is worth it."
58,1969,"Sep 14 2009 	Chronically understaffed	Stayed here for three nights during the US Open 2009. Was expecting good things, but had forgotten that I had been spoilt by the great hotels in Asia. The hotel is ok - rooms are ok (I was in a standard room so nothing exciting). The hotel is old - and it shows. Air conditioning did not work that well, glasses in the room were dirty when I checked in, bathroom was average. The hotel is in a great location - right in the middle of things in NYC - not too far from anywhere. But WORST of everything was the level of service. There were queues EVERYWHERE. It takes 20 mins to chekc in and out, 15 mins to get to speak to the concierge, 20 mins until you order breakfast and then another 20 until the first drink arrives! FYI, the breakfast buffet was US$45 or so - before a tip!!! It is obvious that they have severely cut back on staff. While I can see that at one time it was a &quot;grand old hotel&quot; there has been underinvestment recently - and they clearly do not have enough staff for the number of guests at the hotel."
59,1969,"Sep 10 2009	absolutely amazing!	This hotel is located on the east side of New York on Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue which is the ideal spot. Its close to grand central station, just a few blocks from fifth avenue, walking distance to central park and times square. The service was excellent. The room was very spacious which was what we wanted. The beds were so comfortable too! and there was a huge tv with loads of channels. the bathroom was lovely too. We had an amazing view of the chrysler building from our room. the room had air conditioning which could be adjusted to a temerature you prefer. We never had a meal in the hotel but we did have drinks in the bar twice, the service in the bars was excellent both times. This was an amazing hotel and i would definitley stay here again."
60,1969,"Sep 9 2009 	GREAT grand hotel!	A fabulous hotel that brought me back to the good-old days of luxury and pampering as soon as I walked through the doors. Elegant and very impressive, my room was comfortable and nicely appointed, without being lavish. One down side was low water pressure, but in a hotel that large, that has to be expected. An excellent stay in an excellent town!"
61,1969,"Sep 9 2009 	Old world glamour	A stay in New York is never complete without a visit to this hotel.Old world glamour,warmth and hospitality is what the Waldorf is about.Incredible lobby , comfortable rooms.There is a sense of history about this hotel.We got a chance to see the ballroom which was beautiful.The location is fantastic.Overall a very good experience."
62,1969,"Sep 6 2009 	An amazing stay in New York	We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for 2 nights in a Deluxe Room. The hotel grand lobby is so beautiful, first impressions are Wow. The room we had was grand, the size was roomy with a lovely large bathroom and a large flat screen tv. The Staff were friendly and we were given a free early check in and a late check out which was excellent. Another bonus is free wireless internet in the main lobby. Just a hint is that there is a Starbucks in the hotel, advice is to use the Starbucks, 3 min walk away it is 35% less in price. Als depending on how far ahead you book the better room rate, we found April and August the best rates.Otherwise a glorious old hotel with so much character."
63,1969,Sep 5 2009 	Amazing!!!	We have officially fallen in love with NYC. The Waldorf=Astoria was awesome.
64,1969,"Sep 2 2009 	Not even close to a luxury hotel operation	stay away, watch your credit card charges from the Peacock Alley Rest. save all receiptsno exhaust fans in bathrooms. You cant survive on your past reputation in today's market. Small rooms"
65,1969,"Aug 31 2009 	Great room great service great location....	The opulent hotel lobby and wonderful decor met all expectations. Plenty of bars and resturants although quite expensive. The rooms were clean, well equipped and the beds we just so comfortable. Its not a ultra modern hotel but its charm lies in its history and architecture. Its location was in walking distance of all the major attractions and we would definately visit again."
66,1969,"Aug 28 2009 	Missed the top rating	Everything about the hotel was exceptional. It is, afterall, historic in its reputation for catering to the rich and famous. We were give a room (mini-suite) on the 16th floor that had windows on two sides. It was interesting to see how at one time it had been two rooms but had been remodeled into a &quot;mini-suite.&quot; We were very pleased with the size of the room, the view, and the bed - very comfortable. A couple of problems: 1. Bathroom could have been cleaner - hairs were noticed on the floor. 2. The balcony - which was expansive - was obviously the repository for those who smoked. See photos. This was inexcusable. A cursory glance around the balcony by staff would have taken care of this issue. --- Expensive, but it was our anniversary."
67,1969,Aug 26 2009 	Great Experience will definitely stay again!	We stayed at the Towers and the room was great! We had an amazing view as well! Will definitely stay again. We normally stay at the Sheraton New York and you cannot even begin to compare the two! The staff were really friendly unlike the Sheraton where they are rude and are not really interested! Some of the staff at the breakfast room could have been a little nicer! It was almost like they were doing us a favour!
68,1969,"Aug 26 2009 	You have not experiences New York if you have not stayed at the Waldorf Astoria!	I Would most deffinately recommend this hotel to anyone who wants the ultimate New York experience. It's location is fantastic for first time visitors and experienced travellers. Nestled perfectly on Park Avenue you are a stones throw away from Grand Central Station which is not only a must see, but makes it easy for you to get around, and impossible to get lost. You are also within EASY walking distance from central park, rocker fella centre and many more attractions. Just tap the address into google maps and see for yourself!!!Within the hotel you are greeted by the most helpful staff who are a credit to the hotel. Everywhere is spotless. The rooms are huge and come with all the facilities from irons, hair dryers to satelite television offering a decent range of programmes. Although I found that the power output from electircal appliances such as hair dryers and straighteners was weaker than I am used to, so ladies you may have to get up a little earlier for perfect hair!!!The food is amazing with varieties to suit all tastes. Although not the cheapest, it is not necessarily expensive when you consider the expertise of the chef that is cooking for you!!! Not every day can you say an award winning chef has prepared your lunch...well you can when staying at the Waldorf.You do not get the impression that the Waldorf attracts a &quot;type&quot; of traveller, there is always a range of people wandering in awe around the lobby from business associates to families, to couples. The hotel caters for the needs of all it's guests on an individual basis, which makes you feel invited to part of the hotel family (not a fish out of water)My partner and I would never contemplate staying anywhere else and will be back as soon as possible!!!!"
69,1969,"Aug 25 2009 	Good value...for a trip to the zoo	The Waldorf was once the grande dame of New York hotels. Now it is a joke. It swarms with ill-dressed tourists slouching around the once-famous clock in the central lobby. Anyone wearing a suit and tie feels desperately out of place.However, if you appear in the lobby in business attire, not having realised when you reserved your NY hotel that Hilton has dumbed down this property beyond redemption, things will look up. You will likely be singled out by a staff member who will extricate you from the maddening hordes, whisk you into a private room off the lobby and check you in super politely and super promptly. It is the Waldorf's way of apologizing to its former clientele and it is a very welcome touch.I find a junior suite at the Waldorf one of the best values in New York, about the same price as a regular room at the Regency across the street..You have to hold your nose in the elevator and you would never consider going into a hotel restaurant or lingering in the lobby. But, once behind the locked door of your bedroom, you can spread out in a large, comfortable space with all relevant amenities....though the bathrooms are still small and old-fashioned."
70,1969,"Aug 24 2009 	The Waldorf is an amazing piece of history.	We stayed at the Waldorf this past weekend and it was an unforgettable experience. The service, staff and accomodations were excellent. I was hoping for the upgrade I requested for a Tower level room to make my husbands birthday surprise over the top but unfortunately one was not available. Our corner room was very nice and large. I was concerned about having a small room with three people. The hotel was quiet and clean and the architecture was impressive. Not a single column without detail. Pride in the craftsmanship truely makes this hotel a must see on your nest trip to New York."
71,1969,"Aug 22 2009 	Elegant hotel with excellent staff	I had booked a double double at the Waldorf through a booking agency after being assured it would be large enough for my family group. One adult, two teens of seperate gender.On arrival when I checked that a rollaway bed was in the room I was told that the size of the room would not accommodate a rollaway. One look at my tired face and the reception staff swung into action, in no time at all we were installed into a two roomed suite. One king size bed in a bedroom and one double bed setee and one rollaway bed in the other room. The rooms were beautiful, clean and fresh with no signs of wear and tear.The daily staff were accommodating and helpful at all times. The lobby of course is grand in every sense of the word. Located near Central Station we found this hotel to be ideally placed and in easy walking distance for shops, restaurants and Central Park.The only thing I missed was the ability to make a cup of tea when I woke at 5 in the morning, a small niggle only."
72,1969,"Aug 21 2009 	bring your pants	We made a quick two night trip to NYC for my wife's birthday. We booked on-line and took them up on their offer of an upgrade if available at check in. I agreed to all three upgrade options and we wound up getting two bedroom suite. The rate was $329/night.Clearly part of why we stayed at the Waldorf was its storied past. Indeed, the lobby oozes of old time class. Although I'm not sure how strictly enforced, they ask all men to wear slacks and a collared shirt after 6 pm. The room was comfortable, but the bathroom kind of small. Also no wireless internet in the room. (The room is wired and the lobby has wireless.)The hotel is close to a subway stop and an easy walk to Radio City, etc., but there really weren't a whole lot of shopping places or restaurants right nearby."
73,1969,"Aug 21 2009 	Classic Luxury	This hotel is undeniably gorgeous and luxe! Probably the most elegant hotel I've stayed at. Although you must remember that it is old. During our stay the plumbing was a small problem, but the helpful staff fixed it right away. It boasts the best brunch in New York City and psssttt- you can see famous people here!! It is VERY VERY VERY expensive though, and is not a usual business class hotel."
74,1969,"Aug 21 2009 	Good place to stay	We just returned from three nights at the Waldorf. We did not stay in the tower rooms, just the regular one. Due to the varried reviews here, there must be some older and some redecorated rooms. Ours looked to be recently redecorated. Nice bathroom with a real medicine cabinet with shelves. That was a plus for me. The beds were very comfortable and clean. It is an older hotel, but kept up nicely I thought. The staff was extremely helpful.Only problem I encountered was when I booked (through their web site). I realized I put down wrong info (which did NOT change price in any way). I called the customer service number to update the info and she rebooked me at $100 more! I called them back and after speaking to numerous people, the manager at Waldorf corrected their error. I also declined the minibar key at checkin (and made them note this on my account). I have heard of numerous problems with minibars and didn't want to argue about this."
75,1969,"Aug 19 2009 	A real dump!!	The rooms were appaling, dirty and small. We had booked for 4 adults and were given a room with 2 small beds then told there was nothing else available. This place is really living on it's name now and needs millions spent on bringing it up to date. The rooms are dark and dingy, the bathrooms are dreadful and dirty. The lobby is nice but thats about the only thing they have spent money on. The restaurant is extortionate and not even that good. Not recommended. The location is OK though."
76,1969,"Aug 15 2009 	Waldorf Astoria - great location	Stayed at the Astoria, found it a great hotel and excellent location.The Greyline bus tour stops at the door, so very handy on that frontThe hotel is one ofthe historic ones in NYC, and on 49th Street, quite close to Rockafeller centre and 5 mins from Broadway, Times square is about 10 mins walk.Room was clean, spacious and that's all we really needed, we ate out for all meals as we thought breakfast was expensive.If there's flags outside on the flagpoles, check out the country flags. that means a senior official from that country is staying, since the UN is close by.Hotel staff efficient, liked the business centre with 10 mins free for all airline online checkin sites, so a great help. Would def go back!"
77,1969,"Aug 14 2009 	What Happened Waldorf!!!!	You used to be the pinnacle of luxury and you were such a disappointment. I arrived and I waited in the longest check in line I have ever seen and I travel every week for work - but this was my first time at this hotel. The entrance was grand but the rooms were very drab, wallpaper was pealing off from the bathroom walls, the rooms were outdated and the carpet had a weird feel to it in my room. I was in RM 2528 which was a corner kink delux room. I was very disappointed and it is not worth the money at all."
78,1969,"Aug 13 2009 	Elegant and wonderful...old style NYC	After reading reviews on Trip Advisor I changed my reservation from the regular Waldorf Astoria room to the Towers. I am soooo glad I did. The difference is amazing! It is almost a seperate hotel with it's own &quot;Private&quot; entrance off the street and a private entrance in the hotel lobby. There is a special private check in desk for the Towers. I got a really great deal on Expedia and was very excited upon check in to find out I had been upgraded to an Executive Suite on a Concierge level. The room was huge (for NYC standards) with a beautiful marble foyer and seperate living room and bedroom. I had a large walk in closet + a coat closet in the foyer and a butlers kitchen with a full size refrigerator, sink, etc. There was a nice size flat screen TV in the living room and one in the bedroom. The room was very elegant and had a feel of &quot;old style&quot; New York. I have stayed at more modern hotels in NYC with beautiful accomodations however this felt more like NYC and definitely very elegant. The concierge level offers a special room that serves a light breakfast including cereals, breads, fruit, and boiled eggs. There was coffee, juice, and water available. There is no afternoon service as with most concierge hospitality rooms I have experienced and the room was always very crowded. One of my travel companions was turned away one morning and offered a voucher for the lobby breakfast on the main level. Although it was very crowded the staff made every attempt to keep things stocked and were always very helpful and polite even when the guests were not. We were asked everyday if our expectations were met as we left. One staff said to me &quot;we want you to leave happy&quot;. Considering the crowd and how rude some of the guests were to the staff, I was impressed with their attitude. The staff were wonderful and the service was exactly what you would expect from the Waldorf. My only issue was that the floors were really slick and I fell in the foyer one evening. We called for ice and it took over 30 minutes for them to bring it up. (no self serve ice machines on the concierge level) Other than that this was a truly wonderful experience."
79,1969,"Aug 13 2009 	Huge impersonal hotel	We visited the hotel twice, in October 2008 and Christmas 2008. Although our stay was nice both times, I won't stay again. The hotel is missing this something special that makes a stay unique. It is huge and impersonal. (Perhaps most hotels are in NY).Upon arrival in December, we were upgraded to a Towers suite. In check out, we realized that this was not a complimentary upgrade, although the front desk employee failed to notify us that we would be charged extra. (I am a Hilton Diamond member). After a lot of complaining the hotel finally accepted to charge the original rate, but the employee in the Towers reception was very hostile bordering to rude."
80,1969,"Aug 12 2009 	Living on a Name	Room not ready when we arrived late afternoon. Room dirty - used tissues in drawers. Moved to a different room - one intended for disabled customers. Electric sockets not attached to walls, exposed wires on socket next to bathroom sink, incredibly noisy toilet (could be heard from the down the corridor). Handle to help people out of the bath came away in my hand - thank heavens I'm not disabled! Towel rail hanging off the wall. Took two days for anyone to come and look at problems and only one of them (the bath handle) got fixed during 4 night stay. No shower gel, etc, in bathroom. 8 for two glasses of coke in the bar - not allowed to put on room bill. The Waldorf Astoria has a great name and reputation, but it totally failed to live up to any of our expectations. I really would not want to go back there!"
81,1969,"Aug 12 2009 	Grande and luxiourious historic feel	My husband and I stayed in Waldorf Astoria, NY, in February while visiting Westminster Dog Show, Madison Sq Garden. We had a fabulous time and we did not regret staying at such a famous and well renowed hotel. To a certain extent you could see that the hotels truly big days are gone, the rooms and the corridors were a little bit in need of a face lift. Could be the pompous style that contributes to that feeling and strangely enough I would not want to have it any other way since that very much is their signature. However, the bath rooms (we had 2 in our room/mini suit) were really fresh and up to date. The bed was extremely comfortable and we liked our little extra room in our mini suite where we could sit and take a drink before bed time. The restaurants, bars, lobby and service were fantastic. Location is perfect on Manhattan."
82,1969,"Aug 11 2009 	Tip: Book Concierge Level Room	Reviews of the Waldorf are mixed. Reviews of the much more expensive Waldorf Towers, on the other hand, are uniformly positive. The trick to staying in the Waldorf Towers at a reduced rate is to book a &quot;Concierge Level&quot; room through the regular Waldorf. Those rooms are located in the Towers, and they are exceptional. Private elevators, 15-foot ceilings, twice daily maid service, and the standard rooms are easily suite-sized which is huge for NYC accommodations. We stayed in July on the 33rd floor in the N/E corner and the room rivaled any hotel in the city. Towers guests also get free access to the beautiful and never-crowded gym and steam room. If your priority is nice accommodations (the service is a little impersonal due to the size and never ending turnover of guests), and great location this is the hotel for you."
83,1969,"Aug 11 2009	W=A is wow=awesome.	We travelled with a bus tour which we booked through Travac, an Ottawa travel agent located in the Westgate Shopping Plaza. Our tour included 4 days and 3 nights at the Waldorf=Astoria in the Theatre District of Central Manhatten, New York City. The price was exceptionally affordable and included 2 tour guides, a video of the Waldorf =Astoria, and a 4 hour tour of Manhatten. We opted to start with a deep tissue massage at the Guerlain Spa on the 19th floor. This included a wonderful foot massage while we completed our questionnaire. We found all the W=A staff to be professional, sincere, respectful and very friendly. Our room, although small, was opulant, with marbled bathroom and a walk in closet big enough to dress in. I would advise requesting a room located near the central air shaft to avoid the street noise from below. In the business centre behind reception, we discovered free internet access for 10 minutes. The gift shop where you can purchase newspapers is also behind reception. Starbucks is located beside the front door on Park Ave., perfect for a quick breakfast. We ended our stay with a tour of the hotel and viewed the beautiful ballroom and the 4 kitchens which span the length of an entire city block. This is a world reknown hotel which houses state visits from queens, kings and presidents. Well worth the stay."
84,1969,"Aug 10 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	Travelled to NY in July was worried about some of the negative reviews of the hotel and was beginning to regret booking it. Our experience could not have been better! Beautiful hotel, stunning lobby and walkways. Small queue to check in, but it was managed very quickly and efficently. Upgraded to an Astor suite although we had only booked a normal double room. Shortly after getting into our suite, reception rang to check we were happy with everything. Suite was amazing, so much room! Decent size bedroom and beautifully decorated lounge. Looked as though it had been recently decorated and was clean and nicely done. Bed was huge and very comfortable. View was nothing special as we were on the 9th floor, but who were we to complain when we got upgraded to such a lovely suite. Lobby is a great place to people watch and there are all sorts of people coming through ! Conciegre was helpful although there always seemed to be a queue. Didn't eat or drink there as it is expensive and there are lots of other places around. I thought the $50 charge for the tour of the hotel was a bit expensive, there should be a discount if you are staying there. Would be nice to have some sort of leaflet about the history of the hotel as it is a very interesting place. Booked a town car to take us to the airport through the hotel for a reasonable price with no charge to store the luggage."
85,1969,"Aug 10 2009 	Amazing	I am certainly not rich, by any means but the Waldorf has been legendary for many years. So when I made my vacation plans with my two teenagers to travel to NYC I wanted to stay at the Waldorf. I was not dissappointed. The Waldorf proved to be everything I had hoped it would be...elegant, timeless and grand. Our corner room was on the 16th floor overlooking the Chrysler Building. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was extremely quiet. We had two luxurious terrycloth robes waiting for us when we arrived. We had our beds turned down each night and our room freshened up. The only cons were that it was hard to regulate the temperature in the room. Also, the escalators in the lobby were not always working, but there are elevators you can take to groud level. The staff was very friendly and nice, but i did provide staff a nice but moddest tip. Admittedly I could not afford to eat in the restaurants at the hotel and the room service prices were out of my budget. But there are plenty of nearby restaurants and delis. Upon check-in, I was given a safe deposit box key where I could lock up valuables, however I didn't need to use it. Yes, there are cheaper, more modern hotels, but people...this is the WALDORF! They didn't get their reputation from being snooty and cheap nor doing things half way. Even if you choose to stay somewhere else, at least go into the plush lobby and look at the beautiful clock, chandiliers and art decco accessories. There's also a mini-museum in the lobby with information about the elegance of this historic hotel. Oh, and another plus is that there is a subway station directly in front of the hotel and the tour buses stop and pick up there. Fabulous!"
86,1969,"Aug 9 2009 	The Best!	We stayed at the Waldorf for 7 days in 2005 after my daughter had an accident and had to have an operation in the States. We stayed there again in 2006. She was in a wheel chair and we got all the assistance from the staff that we needed. Our room was large and beautiful. The Waldorf has an ambience all of it's own and the history has to be preserved. Breakfast, dinner and everything else is great. The autobiography of the original Hilton, left in the room as a gift, changed my life forever. It showed me that you must never give up and always trust God. I have since started a B&amp;B back home and have read the book twice. Thank you Waldorf Astoria for everything you have meant to me."
87,1969,"Aug 7 2009 	DIsappointing and in a time-warp	This former Grand Dame of New York has sadly been overtaken by much better boutique hotels and seems content in being a tired rude reflection of it's location. The Waldorf now is regrettably nothing more than a conveyor belt of middle-class cheap one night / weekend brigade stays who seem obsessed with who can wear the tiniest ill-fitting dress ; who can stay up the latest with their lap top by the piano; and who can swan about talking loudly and looking decidedly unimportant. Sorry - I know that is rather damning but the truth often hurts.The hotel is run by numbers and there is no level of sophistication as is evidenced by the endless daily lobby check-in routines. Watch it and enjoy!!The service reflects this - perfunctory but no extra mile. The detail in the rooms are poor when looked at closely with items missing or fudge repaired. The room we stayed at for 4 nights was crying out for a makeover.The internal finishes, lobby, ballroom and state rooms are indeed art deco glorious but this is not enough to make you feel that the stay was 'special'. It's run of the mill stuff. It is extremely rare that I ever consider leaving a hotel early but this was one of those occasions.By all means stay there for a night just to say you've done it. Eat the salad at the Bull and Bear. Take your cocktail in Harry's Bar (or whatever it was called!)If you want something more sophisticated to unwind you from the daily rudeness and grind of New York then this hotel isn't it. There are far better out there at only a slightly higher price if you know where to look and the truth is this hotel knows it.Disappointing and in a time-warp."
88,1969,"Aug 5 2009 	Met my High Expectations	We stayed at the Waldorf to celebrate our anniversary. I am Hilton gold and we were staying on points. My daughter contacted an individual in management to request we receive special consideration. From the moment we arrived at the check in the service was incredible. We were upgraded to a suite and we received a complimentary gift to mark our occasion. We also enjoyed a fantastic dinner at the Bull and Bear at the hotel. As to some specifics, we were driving; the hotel car entrance off 50th St is a narrow alley that goes under and through the building. Initially the entrance was closed for security, as an ambassador was due to arrive, however his arrival was delayed which then allowed me to get in. The elevators are plentiful and fast. The room was wonderful, the hotel had a recent 'facelift', though close examination of the room revealed some character, the room was very charming. The bed was very comfortable and the showers were tremendous. In the parlor of the suite we could here some elevator mechanical sounds, however the bedroom was very peaceful. We were granted an extra hour for late check out. The hotel was very busy at check in, with a high rate of occupancy. Anticipating we were going to a nice place, we tried to dress for it, it seemed others were trying to make a different statement. To summarize- it is a grand hotel, if you allow it, it will take you back to a higher level of personal service. If you are trying to spend the least amount of money and see NYC it is not for you. People that retrieve cars, carry bags, and provide concierge reservations deserve tips, just like a server in a restaurant. I have stayed at the New York Hilton on Ave of the Americas and the Hilton Times Square, each have their place, but the Waldorf is that special place for something just a cut above."
89,1969,"Aug 5 2009 	A Palacial Hotel	Stayed at the Waldorf last year and it was truly a impeccable experience. Lobby was Grand and they have a old art piece of Clock right in the lobby. Room was spacious. Stairways, corridors, public areas were all Grand. They have a lot of boutique shops near the lobby. Infact in one of the boutiques, there was a set up made with fine pottery which was a mock up set up for a wedding set up done by the Waldorf... That was interesting. The lounge on the Ground Floor looked really grand with the Lavish use of Leather. Service was simply Great. If you walk around the hotel public areas, it is HUGE and sometimes you get lost if you are truly mesmerized with the Granduer. The history and grandeur of the Waldorf make it a wonderful and a memorable place to stay. It was indeed WORTH a STAY.."
90,1969,"Aug 4 2009 	Wonderful and Historic Hotel	I stayed with family at this hotel for one night. There was a slight problem with our reservation that was resolved. We upgraded to a suite and our room was impressive for New York City. We had a full living room, bedroom with 2 beds, and 2 bathrooms. The decor in the room was not over the top, but was very nice nonetheless. The bathrooms featured marble tile and the showers were great!Apparently they do allow small pets for an additional fee. The person I was staying in my room with said that she detected a faint odor of pet urine in the living room, but I did could not smell it. Otherwise, the room seemed clean.I found the housekeeping service to be a bit informal and not what I would expect from a hotel like The Waldorf Astoria. We requested turn down service, and the housekeeper insisted that she begin working on the room before we were ready to leave for the evening (at about 7pm, even though I requested service to begin at 7:30pm). The housekeeper said that she was leaving that floor and didn't want to have to return at 7:30pm. I thought that was a bit odd, but I didn't object. When we returned later that evening, we found that she lowered the window shades, and replenished the towels - but didn't do much else (i.e., turn down beds, provide ice, chocolates, etc).The hotel is very elegant and the lobby, although busy, was wonderful. The lobby felt like a museum to me! If you happen to be there on a Sunday, the Sunday brunch (held in the lobby) is not to be missed!! It's very expensive, but well worth the price.I recommend this hotel to people who can appreciate a historic hotel that is showing its age gracefully. If you are looking for something modern, look elsewhere."
91,1969,"Aug 3 2009 	Magnificent	My wife and I stayed one night in the Waldorf for our wedding anniversary using our hilton honors points. It was like staying in an historic museum. The lobby was grand. It has old photos and artifacts of the hotel in glass showcases. The room is small, but it is old school and that is what I expected. The room was clean and nicely decorated. As a hilton honors gold member they gave us a choice of 2 free drinks at the bar, 100 Hilton points or starbuck coffee and danishes. We took the drinks. So after dinner we went back to the hotel and used our vouchers at the peacock alley bar. The drinks were good, but when I ordered a second drink (gray goose and cranberry) I was charged $18, wow.So to sum it up I highly recommend the hotel but drink elsewhere."
92,1969,"Jul 30 2009 	Trading on its name - avoid	Avoid the Waldorf Astoria. A stay there is like waking up beside a 1950's starlet...in 2009. Yes its name may conjour up glamour and elegance from years gone by but they don't seem to have spent a penny on this hotel since years gone by. The decor is shabby, the carpets are shabby, the room amenities are practically non existent and the service is decidely average. The doormen virtually ignore you as you enter the hotel or exit a cab...yet they'll still come running over at the last minute looking for their pound of flesh. Room service is particularly vile (and overpriced). I ordered something very light, it cost me $100 and I genuinely wouldn't give it to my dog. How can a hotel like this have ancient TV's and not flat screens?! This was my first (and last) stay at the Waldorf and I would advise anyone thinking of staying there to avoid it like the plague. There's little point in wasting your money, especially in these recessionary times. If you want to treat yourself in NYC, try the Plaza or even the Grand Hyatt which in my view is streets ahead of the Waldorf. Hilton need to give this place a massive facelift because at the moment it's living off its (diminishing) name."
93,1969,"Jul 29 2009 	Not what is was nor what it could be	The Waldorf has a great location, beautiful lobby and helpful staff. Unfortunately it is definitely showing it's age...not in a good way. Our room size was fine, but it looked a bit dingy- curtains have been hanging a long time and need cleaning, as did other things in the room. We had 3 people in our group and the room only had double beds which was difficult for us. We actually had a magnificent balcony, but it was unkept, with trash about, and not a stick of furniture on it! What a wasted amenity!!! On our departure I overheard someone saying he was moving to a different hotel since the Waldorf was, &quot;ratty&quot;. I think he had a point."
94,1969,"Jul 25 2009 	A Wonderful Classic!	Stayed at the Waldorf with my wife for her birthday. A beautiful hotel in the heart of Manhattan. You can feel the history. I could imagine Marilyn Monroe walking down these hallways so many years ago. Hotel is perfectly located withing walking distance of 5th avenue shopping, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square etc. Is it the newest around? No. But it's a landmark in which Presidents have stayed! We loved it!"
95,1969,"Jul 23 2009 	It was like staying in a Museum for a week!	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Waldorf in March. We got a great deal off of Expedia, and we were not disappointed. It felt like we were living in a museum for the week. The history and grandeur of the Waldorf make it a wonderful place to stay. It has a central location, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and it is surrounded by some great places to eat/grab a snack. Due to it's age, it obviously is a bit dated, but this is part of its charm. If you're looking for flat screen tv's &amp; a modern feel do not stay here - if you are looking to stay in a part of NY history - I would highly recommend it! We loved every minute of it!"
96,1969,"Jul 23 2009 	From Montreal to NY at the Waldof Istoria	Well what can i say,it GREAT....BRING YOU RE CASH!!!everything here was super,but we will not pay 32 $ for two eggs and if you think of taking a apple from brunch buffet..36$ for buffet.Everything else was super,concierge gave us great info.Oh yes we did get great price on the room 216$ for one night.Good trip all"
97,1969,"Jul 23 2009 	Worst Hotel Service	The quality of the Waldorfs customer service was the worst of any hotel I have ever stayed in. The check in line was long and our room was not available upon arrival, plus we had to wait well beyond the normal check in. To make it worse the staff could have cared less about our trouble This was really unexpected for a hotel of this class. As a frequent traveler I could not have been more disappointed. The rooms were comfortable and clean, restaurant food was good if they work on the service they may in fact actually get repeat business."
98,1969,"Jul 21 2009 	Elegant Hotel in Great Locatoin	My wife and I stayed three nights in the Waldorf Astoria in New York and were very happy with our stay. The entrance off Park Ave. and the lobby are very classy. The staff was friendly and our room was also very nice. We had a corner room that was clean and comfortable. A subway station is only a block away so you have easy access to the city through the subway or from the many cabs that line up in front of the hotel. The only complaint I have is the Bull and Bear Resturant located in the hotel. It is WAY to expensive for the quality of food and service provided. We only went to this resturant for it's convienience. I will write a separate review for the Bull and Bear. Overall, we were both very happy with our stay at the Waldorf and will consider staying there again."
99,1969,"Jul 20 2009 	Outstanding	Stayed at the Waldorf Astoria on honeymoon from 4th-8th July 2009 and had a fantastic time. The hotel is located on Park Avenue and is the perfect location away from the pandemonium of Times Square but in walking distance to eveything....5th Avenue, Grand Central Station, Rockefeller centre all about 5 minute walk. Central park and the Empire State building are about 10 minute walk but there is a line of taxis at the front door of the hotel. The Waldorf itself is spectacular. Anyone who says this hotel is tired must be used to staying in some fantastic places as my wife and I thought it was great. The front entrance is breath taking and our room was just as opulant with a lovely big marbel finished bathroom. We found the staff to be very friendly and received a complementary bottle of champagne on the first night to celebrate our honeymoon. We didnt eat or drink in the hotel so cant comment on that but there are loads of bars and restaurants nearby. We had a fantastic time there and would recommend it to anyone."
100,1969,"Jul 20 2009 	Geat location - great value	Got a great rate on the hilton website for our dates - yes the hotel is a little faded but this is part of the charm, I think. Lobby is great, rooms were large compared to other NY hotels. Lifts a little slow occasionally. Hard to beat the location and athmosphere.One little problem - we had three rooms - two were available on checkin, the third was to be ready in 30 minutes. After two hours of contacting the reception desk it was still not available. They were to call me when available but no call. When we eventually got the third room they told us it was available all along! With such a large hotel I guess the guests are just numbers. Also found the concierge (one guy, not all) with an aittitude."
101,1969,"Jul 19 2009 	Great Address Historic Hotel but just OK	Traveling 2 weeks in New England, We stayed in July for a couple of days with our teenage sons so they could experience a bit of NYC. I used Hilton points so I wasn't expecting the greatest rooms, no view, smaller etc. It was clean and visually nice, with the styling you'd expect but definately starting to show it's age. I'd guess that the last serious renovation of bathrooms was in the late 80s. The A/C wasn't great, it got cool enough but we could never seem to get the dampness totally out of the air. It's central air but I don't think the dials in the room actually control the temp other than the speed of the fan. This is our second stay here in 3 years and we were realistic about it so none of that really bothered us. We slept fine, although the bed was a little soft for my taste. My warning is that if you get the basic room here and are expecting a room with the grandeur of the Waldorf, you're going to be disapointed. Now the lobby, bars, resturants and the staff and all the rest is what you'd guess they would be."
102,1969,"Jul 15 2009 	Watch your credit card bill	I got a great deal through Continental, booking flight and hotel together for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. I compared pricing with the Plaza and found a suite at the Waldorf to be about half the price, having stayed here in June of 2008 and enjoying the experience, I decided to stay here again. We stayed on the Lexington side and noticed that it took a long amount of time to get elevators, unsure if several were out of order or what was wrong.Our room was nice, the decor was great but you could definitely see this is an old hotel but I guess that leads to some of it's charm, the art deco stylings. Each day of my stay I had to request additional towels, even though my reservation was for 4 people, I could only get 3 towels. I even told the clerk at check in &quot;there are 4 people in this room.&quot; I checked out, was told they were not able to print me a bill. 3 weeks later, I found out why. I saw an odd charge on my credit card for $122.77. I called the hotel to ask what this charge was for, we had not taken any items from the room, ordered room service or billed anything to the room. The billing department advised me that Travelocity told them to bill me this fee for extra person charges. I called Travelocity (Apparently the company Continental Airlines uses) and they said they knew nothing of it, had no records of ever telling the hotel this. I was eventually told by travelocity that the receipt says my room was a double room rate, not a quad rate, even though it says the room is for 4 on my receipt. I ended up giving the issue to my credit card company saying I did not authorize the charges and eventually, I was refunded the money. I am not sure if Travelocity, Capital One, or the Waldorf are responisble for the refund because none of them bothered to call or email me with a resolution. Just like they didn't think it was worth it to tell me they were going to bill me extra....3 weeks after the stay. Apparently using 1 extra towel costs you an additional $122.77 at the Waldorf."
103,1969,"Jul 14 2009 	Excellent Experience	Over the last 20 years we've stayed at many hotels in NYC. Coming in from CT for Broadway weekends our thing is to stay at different hotels and try various restaurants in order to soak up the essence of NY. When we saw the special Waldorf rate it was time to experience the best. For $219 we upgraded to the deluxe king room. What a room!! High ceilings, fire place, 42&quot; Flat Screen TV and a terrific view of the Chrysler Bldg. Our freinds weren't as lucky with the view but also had an awsome room. The Waldorf has one of the best lobbys you'll ever see. It's almost like going to a museum. At this rate one's lucky to get a basic room in a average hotel in NYC, take advantage while it lasts."
104,1969,"Jul 12 2009 	Loved this hotel	We stayed here for a week while visiting New York. We parked in the hotel and upon arrival our bags were removed and car was parked within minutes.Reception: Excellent service, fast efficient and very helpfulRoom: We had a corner room which was quite big by NY standards. It included a large walk-in wardrobe that accommodated all of our luggage. The room itself was a little old but was spotless and comfortable. Given what we have paid in similar priced hotels in NY this was easily the biggest room we have stayed in.Location: Perfectly located for all shops in 5th Avenue and approx a 15 minute walk to Union Square.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. It is a little old fashioned, but the service was perfect and coupled with a fantastic room and location, it was well worth the cost."
105,1969,"Jul 9 2009 	BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF OUR LIVES	my wife and i booked this hotel for our honeymoon as we got married on 31/12/2008.prior to our arrival we made a point of informing the reservations desk that it was our honeymoon and we had hoped they would make an effort to make our stay memorable,they made it memorable,but for all the wrong reasons.1.very badly treated when paying for our stay in cash,as i had explained my credit card had a small limit as i dont use it often,verbally congratulated on our ocassion,thats it!2.requested a smoking room,none available on check in,no effort made to accomodate us,the best could be done was the following day,we were given our room the next day.3.the bath stopper was not working in our room,we ordered food in our room as we had just arrived from a long haul flight,we ordered burger and fries and were billed over 100 for our meal which was of a lesser quality than mc donalds,i disputed the bill on the grounds that we were not being treated fairly as it was our honeymoon.they deducted the meal from our account reluctantly following a lenghty call to the duty manager.4.reception failed to give us breakfast vouchers upon check in as we had the option of parking or breakfast and we opted for breakfast.we were told by the restaurant staff that we would be charged in full if we didnt present vouchers.we had to go back to reception and ask for our vouchers that we should have been presented with on check in.4.our final bill was almost $2,000 for the most heart sinking week of our lives.we had really looked forward to staying in thee most renowned hotel in the world.i will always remember the first night of our honeymoon as the night that i comforted and reassured my wife as she cried floods of tears and sobbed herself to sleep. This should have been the most memorable week of our lives,but sadly it was destroyed by the low standards of the best known hotel brand in the world.new york as a city was amazing and i would love to return.to give credit where it is due,the staff at this hotel were extremely warm and welcoming and i would not like to disrespect their professionalism as they are wonderful ambassadors for the company that they work for.this hotel is the equivalent of a 3 star hotel in ireland,we should be proud of our hospitality in ireland,this hotel could learn a few things from the irish hotel model.we were offered a 4 night complimentary stay in the waldorf towers from the general manager who was a very professional man in his approach,but you only get a first chance to make a lasting impression."
106,1969,"Jul 7 2009 	Think Twice Before Staying Here	Just stayed for a 4th of July 2009 visit to NY at the Waldorf. Have previously stayed at the Ritz, Palace, the Sherry Netherland and before renovation, the Plaza. Thought were getting a great deal for a single room - King for under $300 per night. Not so. We were on the Lexington side of the building (no view - but this was not my complaint). Here are the issues: stayed on 13th floor but visited other floors to confirm impression- once you've left the lobby and are on the Lexington tower you'll quickly notice some dramatic changes in quality and feel. Carpetting is very, very worn, does not look or smell clean or fresh. Gave me the same sense of cleanliness of the security checkpoint carpeting at the airport. Other than the ballroom floors, the hallways on the Lexington tower appeared to lack air conditioning and proper ventilation. I am 40 something guest....and never cared about ventilation before. Courtesy and personalized attention is non-existent (at least for patrons at this rate) - if you need anything more than to hand a tip or your credit card to anyone. The shower admittedly old, did not provide reasonable expectations of hot water or adequate pressure. The front desk attendees had a difficult time delivering a complete bill including mini bar charges. The mini bar had stale $6 potato chips. Room door is not well insulated. In the morning, we heard the whispers and non-whispers of a dutiful (and courteous) cleaning staff on the adjacent rooms. However, not a good sign if sleep is what you need. The TV appeared to be a $100 1990 Walmart purchase - my local Motel 6 has already updated to flat screens - not sure if too much to expect from the hotel touted as the only one where the President stays. Arrived very late at night with not another guest at the time. Nevetheless - it took over 35 minutes for the bags to make my room. It took me 3 minutes to get up to my room. We were pleased by the comfortable bedding. Not impressed by anything else. Hotel business center and computers are quite out of date. You share printers with others in a four computer small room. Difficult if you have sensitive business to work on. I thought this was unbelievable for a hotel of this magnitude. Person in charge of taking my bags for the afternoon after checkout would not stop asking what is my profession and whether business is good - not sure this is what I want to discuss with the hotel staff. Top notch, courteous, professional, personalized attention was non-existent. Does not favorably compare with any of the other five/four star staple hotels in NYC. I've never written a review before but thought this was an important one to write."
107,1969,"Jul 6 2009	Just good!	It was great, but also expensive...If money is not playing a big role for you, you should try it! Very beautiful grand hotel and one of the oldest!"
108,1969,"Jul 6 2009 	Worth it-once(or twice) in a life time!	Outstanding from the great check in staff to the staff in the hallways. This hotel that was once owned by George Bolt of Bolt Castle fame on the St. Lawrence River(now mostly restored) lives up to it's previous reputation for greatness. The rooms bring you back to a time of pure elegance and fine service. From gold fixtures to wonderful bedding this is a must. The rates very widely so look deep into the travel websites for a bargain. You will need to save money somewhere to afford a cocktail at the Bull and Bear Bar-$17.50 per. we stayed here,but, now retired, ate off site. Cheap or frugal?"
109,1969,"Jul 5 2009 	Wonderful honeymoon stay	What an amazing honeymoon, being in New York was fantastic staying at the Waldorf Astoria, Park Avenue was everything we expected from a 1930's iconic building as beautiful inside as outside. From the moment we walked into the foyer through the grand marbled corridor to the reception area we felt back in the era of Ginger Rogers, Lana Turner and Walter Pigeon. The service was wonderful, complementary chocolate strawberries and champagne and letters, we felt decadent and like film stars. The room was lovely on a corner on the 24th floor. The views were spectacular. The room was comfortable and big and the bed and bedding was so comfortable. We spent very happy evenings in the cocktail bar. It was the best honeymoon in the world and we loved it so much we're going back in August!"
110,1969,"Jul 4 2009 	Dont compare it to other hotels...	Excellent old hotel with a &quot;character&quot;, not comparable to the most other hotels in this price range: simply a &quot;must have stayed&quot;! Centrally located in midtown. Smooth check-in and -out. I stayed in the &quot;Astoria level&quot; (26th floor) in a clean and very spacious room; breakfast (on the same floor) was included in my price. Fantastic furniture in all rooms! WLAN was free - but only in the (very comfortable) lobby. I could not receive phone calls from outside directly (only via operator), which was not a problem in my case. Staff was friendly and efficient. On a business trip, I would recommend anyone to add one day extra just to enjoy this hotel, and New York, of course. But I would not refuse to stay for weeks, either..."
111,1969,"Jun 29 2009 	Great history; Fun to have done it once	We were excited to stay at the historical Waldorf Astoria, to look at the pictures and marvel at the beautiful decor in the lobby - and it was very interesting to see and read about the history... but the charm ended there. Our room was small and in need of being renovated, the drinks/ food were very overpriced, as expected, and the service for what I would expect from a world-class hotel, was very mediocre. No one was rude, but I expected better service and more attention and have gotten better service from many other hotels. I'm happy we stayed there, but next time I think we'll shoot for staying somewhere in Times Square closer to the action for the same price. For first-time tourists, I recommend walking to Times Square - it's a straight shot down 49th and only about 10 blocks and you pass Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Music Hall and 5th Avenue all on the way. Go there for dinner and drinks and save yourself some money!"
112,1969,"Jun 29 2009 	fabulous hotel	after searching for the &quot;perfect&quot; hotel getaway, I choosed the waldorf. I read all previous reviews and went with an open mind. I couldnt have selected a more beautiful, well appointed hotel, it still has all the glamour and history I was expecting. Our room was upgraded to a suite, the appointments were gorgeous, the bed fabulous, linens perfect, this room had it all. I was very pleased with the selection. The front checking was wonderful, easy, fast, the desk staff was friendly, smiling, happy to be working at such a classic hotel. When asking for anything every staff member was friendly and willing to go the extra, I had a wonderful stay at such a fabulous hotel, I would go again, without a doubt."
113,1969,"Jun 27 2009 	Nice but not what I expected!	We arrived around 6pm by limo. The hotel staff in the parking area were to say the least uninterested in our arrival and I had to find one of them to take care of our luggage. We were given what was described as an upgraded room, that was a little disappointing. It could do with some TLC and redecorating. The staff were great, all being helpful and couteous.A couple of weeks before this stay, we stayed at the Hilton New York and have to say our suite there was more comfortable and our welcome to the hotel more professional. We were really made to feel welcome there. Not as nice as we had expected!"
114,1969,"Jun 24 2009 	Having stayed in luxury hotels worldwide the Waldorf falls way short of expectation.	Initial impressions of the Waldorf were poor and nothing happened for us to change our minds.Queueing in a long line on arrival for reception was annoying and the receptionist just rattled off what was an obvious sales pitch when she asked us if we'd like to eat. We were in a &quot;king superior&quot; which was spacious and clean, but backed on to 49th Avenue where garbage vans work constantly from 5-10.30pm every weekday emptying out the rubbish from the office block opposite. Forget trying to sleep while this is going on, even if you have jetlag travelling from the UK. Breakfast in the Peacock restaurant was $33 for the worst buffet I've ever seen or eaten. Actually &quot;buffet&quot; is an exaggeration, there were just a few slices of processed cheese, 2 (!!) slices of inedible meat, some bread and fresh fruit (the melon was disgusting) to choose from. The waiter had the nerve to tell us we couldn't share like we were schoolchildren. Breakfast downstairs serves up a decent fruit bowl with a choice of bread - a mere $28. On the last day of our stay, we went down the road to the deli and had the same breakfast for $10 each.You have to queue for the concierge as well as reception, this time to be told they didn't have any brollies to lend us. Knowing traders were waiting outside and selling them for $5.This is a hotel still relying on past glories. The large reception hall is bling Art Deco, as are the ladies restrooms, but behind this grandeur, there's a tired feel to the place. The Waldorf is part of the Hilton group who continue to rely on its previous high reputation and status, charge ludicrous amounts of money for everything and expect people to put up with it. Well, wrong, we'll stay elsewhere next time we're in New York."
115,1969,"Jun 23 2009 	Much better this time	I already wrote a review of this hotel last year, and am writing for a second time, as my recent staty there was much better; actually very good. I do not whether it is a diffferent room or service is getting better during the downturn. The quality of the room was great, all systems worked fine, and staff was courteous."
116,1969,"Jun 22 2009 	Jackpot!	Although I was concerned after reading some reviews I kept our reservations at the WA in NY for the beginning of our vacation. I'm SO GLAD I did! I rec'd excellent service from the first reservation call, the 2 calls prior to arriving (I was nervous because some member pics of the beds made them look small), to the day we checked out. Nothing short of &quot;bend over backwards for us!&quot; We got what I think is the &quot;expedia&quot; room because the view I've seen in pics too. It is not the Park Ave view, but I can't expect that for the expedia price I paid, but it was a good view of the Chrysler Bldg. and the room was actually quite large with a walk in closet. Edgar the doorman was a hoot! He recommended Pizza at Angelo's and it was perfect. Not a far walk either. We also walked to Ess-a-bagel and didn't get yelled at--even though we hoped we would just to get that NY feel! haha! They were delicious. Everyone that we encountered at the hotel were great, except the waiters in the lobby bar where we stopped for a welcome cocktail with the free beverage coupon they gave us. But we had kids and they probably didn't want to be bothered with them. Our room was stale smelling upon arrival but what can you expect form an older hotel. I asked for freshener and Mason was there in less than 10 minutes to spray an orange scented freshener and it was fine. My rating from 1-10--WA gets a 9!We wanted &quot;kid friendly&quot; apps and drinks one night so we stopped by TGI Fridays. HORRIBLE mistake! Horrible horrible service, the food tasted like it had been sitting around for days. Save your money and take the ecommendations of hotel staff instead."
117,1969,"Jun 18 2009 	Awesome building service Sucks	I went to stay at this hotel for 2 days to celebrate a mini-honeymoon. The check in process was nice, and the guy at the front desk told me that he was sending me a complimentary strawberry and champagne package.That's where the excellent service ended. Two days and three phone calls later, there were no strawberries and there was no champagne. I also made a reservation at the steakhouse, bulls and bears, through the hotel phone (from my room). When I reached the restaurant, the maitr'd told me that he had no record of my reservation. He did not apologize for it; instead he seemed to try to make me feel sorry for visiting the restaraunt without a reservation. Despite several empty seats, he sat my fiancee and I in a cramped space surrounded by other people. We left the place and went to a much friendlier and nicer steakhouse.The Waldorf Astoria hotel has excellent history, but needs to get its act together. I will never stay there again"
118,1969,"Jun 17 2009 	Shabby but you have to go	Let's be upfront - I was thrilled to be booked into the Waldorf Astoria, even though anticipating that it would be a faded and worn shadow of its Thirties glory. And it was, but I would still go again with the family just to share with them a New York landmark.Stayed in three rooms over 4 nights. The first room was tiny with two double beds lacking any form of back support. Was moved to a quirky mini-suite overlooking the front entrance. This is the sort of room which makes staying in an old hotel so memorable. It had an entrance foyer, bedroom, a huge dressing room (large enough for a small couch, dressing table and two armoires) and an art deco bathroom on a raised platform. Incredible. The third room was a nicer version of the first.All the rooms were worn and in need of repainting, new furniture and carpets. But it was all well worth staying for the fireplaces in the halls, lobby area and the ability to say that you stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria."
119,1969,"Jun 13 2009 	Absolutely fantastic!	Stayed here 6th - 8th June as part of a 5-night NY trip to celebrate a 50th birthday. From the moment we arrived till the moment we left we were treated so well, the staff were all pleasant, helpful, attentive, no pretentiousness, and a real credit to the hospitality industry! We were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The bathroom had plentiful towels and toiletries, the shower had power, the bed was huge and the living area with its gorgeous chandelier was just magnificent! The staff sent up a bottle of bubbly to help us celebrate too! We had a couple of drinks in Sir Harry's bar where the high standard of service was replicated, nice dish of complimentary mixed nuts! - and the prices weren't too bad in comparsion to the big measures!Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, you just cannot fault it."
120,1969,Jun 12 2009 	I was amazed by the heritage and splendor	If you want to have a blend of heritage and modernity....Waldorf-Astoria is a place to be in. Never you see both of these blending with so much ease.There are tons of stories and anecdotes on Waldorf. Ensure that you take a guided tour of the hotel.
121,1969,Jun 8 2009 	Glamour and glitz	Wonderful service and equally wonderful hotel. Not the cheapest but it was a treat for my wife. One of the &quot;must do&quot; hotels as you travel around the world.
122,1969,"Jun 7 2009 	your not a guest... your a number	We decided to stay at the Waldorf Astoria in honour of our wedding in New York City. The Waldorf to us seemed very New York, very classic - it would fit so perect into our New York Destination Wedding.I was VERY disapointed in the hotel and service however not to be confused with my STAY in New York , that was amazing. You often read reviews and think &quot;Disgruntled traveller and blames everything &quot;. I have taken the time to join up on Trip Advisor and write this review as I feel my stay needs to be shared. Check In - was quick and professional. however no &quot;extra&quot; service. Can conceirge help you with dinner reservations?, can I assit with any local information, is there anything I can do to assit with your stay ahead of time?. None of these were asked and it would have been a nice touch. It felt like you were at an airline counter, line up and be sent off in a hurry...ConceirgeRude , Rude , Rude and unhelpful. I was made to feel like an inconvenience at any time I had a request . Very disapointing. ExtrasIt would have been nice to receive a welcome card or congratulations card or our wedding ; however their was no acknowledgement at all. Even though it was noted in our reservation and wearing a wedding dress is a clear indication. It wasnt a big deal however small touches do differ hotels from others. Room ServiceA bottle of champagne was delivered as a suprise to us from a friend ; we were then charged for this. Upon explaining this was a gift and it had clearly been pre paid ; we were given the third degree. After making us wait they found the records and then decided to remove it the bill. I was made to feel as if I was lying and trying to get a ree bottle !We clearly made the mistake of putting our champagne in the minibar as then we were charged or $100.00 worth of items that were just moved to the side to make room.We were told that we were not allowed to make room for personal rereshments and that was considered taking the product. The drinks were just put on the side of the fridge as the minibar attendant would have clearly noted. Really.... a little pathetic. Afterall its still the champagne that was from their hotel.Valet Asking for my wedding dress to be pressed was such a challenge. I never thought a reequest of this nature would prove such a challenge and a 40 minute wait in the lobby.The bell captain was very unhelpful just telling me to call the Laundry on his desk phone and ask them my request ... very unprofessional ... can they not annouce calls and or handle requests themselves , making me wait?The service of the dress at the end was well done.All in all , I never mind paying top dollar for above adverage service to say the least this was just below par. The hotel would charge you to breathe! from $13.95 a minute local phone calls , excessive business centre charges, charged for extra glasses to be brought to your room, $5.00pp room service fee... I am sure the list goes on.The room was spacious , very clean, amenities very high standardm, and housekeeping very attentive. If you are after a Waldorf Astoria experience come for coffee and people watch in the foyer , dont bother staying ....go to the Plaza instead. I had high tea at the Plaza and just that 1 hour experience was wonderful ; the stay would have been too ....Unortunately, my Waldorf experience was far below adverage."
123,1969,"Jun 7 2009 	The good and bad of an old school hotel	New York city is unique to the world, and I like staying in uniquely New York hotels when I'm there. The Waldorf definitely qualifies. It has the great lobby, half a dozen food/drink options, and the feel of something old and wise. The lobby is always hopping, which I love. That said, the hotel doesn't do anything super - the rooms are small, some areas are a little worn, they don't always have enough people working the front desk, etc. But, for me, this is so much better than the cookie-cutter hotel experience that you will get at the big chains, even in NYC. When you wake up and stumble into the lobby, you won't forget what city you're in, and that's worth something. The Waldorf gets a thumbs up."
124,1969,"Jun 4 2009 	It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This	The Waldorf=Astoria not only lived up to it's legendary reputation, it exceeded it. I have stayed here several times and it has always been a phenomenal experience. On the most recent stay I brought my wife and two young children (6 and 9) up for the kids' first trip to New York.as part of a business trip I was on. The only downside to this decision is that the bar set by the Waldorf=Astoria can never be reached by anywhere else and my kids will now measure every other hotel by this stay. Every staff member is friendly, helpful, enthusiastic, professional and genuinely nice. We had the great fortune of staying in a room that almost defies description - it was beyond elegant. I have also had the pleasure to stay in other rooms which may not have been as large, but were still very luxurious and roomy. I recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to have a real New York, or for that matter, world class, experience. The room rate was an excellent value. The location is great as well - on Park Avenue, a short walk to Grand Central, Fifth Avenue and Times Square. I always look forward to staying at the Waldorf."
125,1969,"Jun 2 2009 	An Old Grand Place...	We just came back from a three-night stay with our two kids. The Waldorf is very different from our &quot;usual,&quot; which tends to be more of the boutique, home-style, 4 or 5-star places. The Waldorf is old style. Grand. Old glamour. Traditional. It has some really great features, such as thick walls, heavy real wood doors and furniture, thick gold-colored drapes, real heavy handles for the bathroom door (so it's much easier to open when you have just put lotion on your hands!), door bell and mail slot, etc. The one and only downside is there is no free wi-fi (amazing in this day and age; even at the Hampton Inn there is free wi-fi!). We're glad to have stayed here. Would I do it again? Probably not... but if you haven't stayed here, it's a good experience. We got a really great deal off of their website (pre-paid, no money back, etc.). Comparatively, the price was much cheaper than others we'd looked at. Room service was decent, but super expensive."
126,1969,Jun 1 2009 	Beautiful Classic Hotel	My family and I chose to stay at the Waldorf due to the history and location of the hotel. Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor I ws confident we would not be disappointed and we were not. Even with its age the hotel was in great shape and our room was very nice. We ended up in the tower on the 35 th floor with a great view of the city. The room had a large well appointed bathroom and VERY comfortable beds. The lobby was goergous and the staff very nice and helpful. Well worth the price.
127,1969,"Jun 1 2009 	SO ELEGANT!!!	We stayed at the Waldorf in late January. The hotel is very close to Grand Central Station so it made transportation so easy. We were so impressed with the hotel. The staff was great and the room was awesome! We had issues with the heater at that time, and they graciously upgraded us to a suite since it was also my first time in the city. The concierge was very helpful and the entire NYC experience was made much more memorable because of this hotel."
128,1969,"Jun 1 2009 	Absolutely Horrid	Worst excuse for a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel I've ever seen, anywhere, including the Third or Fourth World. aStayed in &quot;Upgraded&quot; king room with Hilton Diamond (highest) status. Rooms are extremely dated and in poor condition. Bed and bed linens smelled as if they had not been changed from the last guest, the beds had to be changed twice on check in and the pillows had to be swapped out for new ones. Room was not ready, despite Diamond Status and notification to the hotel upon booking of time of arrival. Carpet was so worn as to be slippery, and indeed we did both slip several times. Very, very loud, even for location. I have lived in and visited Manhattan my whole life, and I assure you there are much better hotels at the price - try the Sherry Netherland or Lowe's Regency. When I was a child in Manhattan this was known as an hotel for business, parvenu tourists, and an &quot;event&quot; venue for second rate debutante balls - but I cannot think anyone in even any of these classes would put up with this hotel. If you really think there is something special about this hotel, visit the lobby and the bar - if you need to get your hair done, go the Kenneth's by all means - but for Heaven's sake, stay elsewhere!"
129,1969,Jun 1 2009 	One night stay - upgrade to a suite in the Towers	I spent one night at the Waldorf last week. I usually stay in another mid-town hotel but for logistical reasons chose to stay at The Waldorf this time. I had a very nice - but perhaps atypical - experience. I booked at superior room but at check in was upgraded to a one-bedroom suite in the Waldorf Towers. Decor a little dated -- but very large and very comfortable. I was on the 33rd floor so not bothered by street noise which can be intense in Manhattan. My room rate included breakfast at Oscar's - a choice between American or Continental breakfast -- breakfast was good and they brought me a nice big pot of tea. The hotel is enormous and obviously caters to a convention/group crowd. The public areas are very nice and they showcase the long history of the hotel. Definitely NOT a boutique hotel experience. Location is terrific - right down the street from Saks and St. Patrick's Cathedral. All hotels in Manhattan are expensive but with my upgrade this was great value -- and also would have been good value even without it.
130,1969,"May 27 2009 	Grand Art Deco Hotel	excellent service. The reception desk was friendly and helpful. The bell staff was easy to find and very helpful. The room was well furnished. The east side location is hard to beat. The public areas are beautifully restored. I've stayed in a number of fine hotels; this one succeeded in impressing me. The only complaint was the prices charged in the restaurants (breakfast wasn't that good). High, even by New York standards."
131,1969,"May 26 2009 	not worth it	I stayed there 5 nights in may 09 with my mum in 2 different rooms.I've chosen the superior ones. When we arrived, only one was ready, the other wich was gaven later was on the same floor but not the same size, first question. Then I wanted to use the internet, the connexion is announced at &quot;a nominal fee&quot; for those room on the WA website....15$ a day, is it nominal?? they also say that the maid comes twice a day, they never showed up for the night tunr!! when I complained at the front desk, the answer I had was &quot;oh, ok, sorry&quot;...is it an answer you're supposed to get for such a hotel?Well, of course, the hotel's got a very nice lobby but I guess one should better just have a look there but stay in an other hotel...."
132,1969,"May 25 2009 	This is my type of hotel !	Wow....the moment you walk into this hotel you know your walking into history. A beautiful gracious elegant masterpiece oozing with magnicent architectural features.This is my type of hotel. A hotel that stands proudly with memoirs of the famous and the ordinary; a stylish grandeur of stately opulence in days gone by. A hotel with a story.Check in  Busy hotel with queues but extremely friendly and professional.Room  Our suite 1148 was traditionally furnished with a spacious lounge room which consisted of a lounge suite, large working desk , mini bar, and beautiful antique furniture. The bedroom was enormous with a comfortable king size bed and a cabinet with TV. Off the bedroom was a walk-in dressing room with safe. Bathroom  spacious with great walk-in shower and large vanity unit.Location  Marvellous location just around the corner from Fifth Avenue. The hop on/ hop off bus has a stop outside the hotel.Staff - All happy to assist, we found all members to be totally professional and proficient.Dining  We had a very ordinary breakfast the first day in the caf downstairs. However, we were blessed when our US clients escorted us to the Sunday brunch and Oh my goodness, what a delightful feast. We were very happy we didnt have to pay ! as its very expensive but a must do if staying in the hotel on the weekend. Overall  We loved our stay at the Waldof Astonia. Its a &quot; real &quot; hotel that is smothered with old fashioned grandness and luxury. Staying in New York at the Waldorf was a wonderful experience and a very special treat !"
133,1969,May 22 2009 	Worth the Experience-very good	Impressive hotel especially the lobby areas. The rooms and corridors are more dated and a little worn but the comfort and service makes up for it. Our room had the disadvantage of having a generator running all nights on the roof outside our window but with ear plugs you wouldnt hear it. However at a hotel of this claibre i would have expected double or tribble glazing on the rooms facing this internal lightwell to help dampern the generator noise or sort out the noise form the equipment in the first plave.That aside we had a lovely stay and would defenatily stay again i would just ask for a room well away for that roof in future.
134,1969,"May 21 2009 	Beautiful Hotel rooms vary	My sister and I were visiting NY and booked the Waldorf 7 months in advance. We arrived at 1 am without luggage as the airline had lost our luggage. The lobby is gorgeous and well maintained. The man at the front desk, I believe his name was Amin checked and found our room had been given away and immediately upgraded us to a luxury suite. He also assured us he would send up toiletries. He was very professional and helpful and such a relief to find someone so helpful in NY! Sure enough he sent up a great pack of all the toiletries we would need. The suite was nice and consisted of a living room, bedroom, front hall, dressing room and bathroom. The furnishings and window shades appeared to be a bit worn but other than that it was very nice. The next night we switched to a normal room which was a corner room overlooking Park Avenue. This room seemed very updated, was very large, had high ceilings and very comfortable. Our parents were also on the trip and I found their room to be a bit dark and also a little outdated and smaller so I think the rooms really vary. I would recommend asking for a corner room. The bathrooms are nice, GREAT water pressure. The actual location of the hotel is great because you are within walking distance of Times Square and Broadway but enough removed to not be in the middle of the chaos. Also being 2 blocks from 5th avenue was nice since we didn't have any luggage! The Bull and Bear Bar hosts the Fox Business Network show &quot;happy hour&quot; every weekday so we went and had a drink at the bar and watched the taping which was a lot of fun. We only ate at the hotel for breakfast at Oscars which was very good. Overall I am confident I would stay here again but would request a corner room. Great staff at both the front desk and restaurant."
135,1969,"May 21 2009 	beautiful hotel friendly helpful staff	Looking at the reviews here, I'm surprised.....I found this hotel to be absolutely clean, perfectly furnished, fabulous lobby, hallways to rooms beaufully well maintained and rooms with everything so clean and fresh, it looked as if the room had just been redecorated. Sfaff were consistly friendly, smiling, and helpful. drinks were over priced in the bar but the choice is yours' to drink elsewhere... loved it!!!"
136,1969,"May 19 2009 	1st class service with excellent facilities.	I recently stayed at The Waldorf Astoria in NYC for a holiday with my now fiancee.I got a great deal for 2 nights through hiltons own website. I had put on my booking form that i would be arriving on my birthday.I thought nothing more of it. From arriving with very bad jet lag and no bags (Grrr British Airways), the staff at the hotel couldnt do enough to make us feel welcome. They pointed us in the direction of clothes stores to purchase replacement clothes which the airline lost and generally made us feel special. On returning to the hotel after a days sightseeing, we returned to our room to find a tray of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne with a hand written card from the general manager wishing me a happy birthday and &quot;if there was anything the hotel can do for you to enhance your stay, please do not hesitate to contact me&quot;. I was so impressed by this hotel and its staff i decided to propose to my girlfriend in the hotel as opposed to elsewhere in the city. It really was that good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone time and time again."
137,1969,"May 19 2009 	An old hotel with lots of character	I stayed in the Waldorf for 5 nights this month and really enjoyed my stay. It is a heritage building and one of the oldest hotels in New York. I believe it is nick named The Old Dame. The decor is old fasioned and you feel as though you are being taken back to the Marilyn Monroe/Frank Sinatra era when you are there. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Manhatten. And the staff were friendly and helpful."
138,1969,"May 17 2009 	Not what you expect for the price	We stayed at this hotel for seven nights. Before we went we had high expectations due to the Waldorf name. This hotel is very run down and needs a major renovation. The rooms are a decent size but everything seems old and needs replaced. We found the staff in the hotel not too friendly unless you had cash in your hands ready to tip. The man who works in the security deposit box area is extremely sad and angry looking. Overall I would not stay here again, it is not worth the money and living on an old reputation."
139,1969,"May 17 2009 	Great location rooms dated service so so	We took a family vacation at Thanksgiving to New York. The location is great, but our room was very dated.(over $400 a night). We got to the airport to fly home and realized we left our video camera in the room. We could not get a live person on the phone. It was 2 days later before someone from lost and found called us back. Of course they said they could not find our camera. I sure they didn't even look. I do not think I will be staying there again."
140,1969,"May 14 2009 	Wonderful Stay; Can't Wait to Return	Having read mixed reviews of the Waldorf on Tripadvisor, I was a little worried about having booked it. Fortunately, I had the most fantastic stay, and ended up being impressed in just about every regard. The hotel is itself one of the most beautiful in New York; the entrance lobby with its stunning mosaic floor and grandly old-world crystal chandelier was always such a happy place to come home to, and the main lobby is itself a feast of beautiful woodwork and lavish craftmanship. Indeed, despite being an old hotel, the main floor has been renovated and maintained to perfection. The rooms themselves are older, it's true--yet ours had clearly been recently redone, as everything was immaculate, from the lovely new carpet and drapes to the marble-topped bedside table and desk. My one complaint was that the tub in the bathroom had obviously not been redone in years; however, the bathroom was nevertheless dripping in marble, and as nice as everything else was, I quickly got over that one quibble. And of course, everything was utterly spotless, as clean and well-maintained as could be.Having said that, make no mistake--the Waldorf *is* an old-fashioned hotel, and if you crave everything being modern then you will probably not care for the decor or the overall presentation. However, it is all incontrovertibly classy, and truly a wonderful place to stay. The location is absolutely perfect, too, central while still being peaceful and refined. I was there for a week, and it quickly came to feel like home; I was more sorry to leave it than I have been to leave any hotel in quite some time, and I am already looking forward to returning the next time I am in New York.Just the same, there are compromises, as with any hotel. Parts of the hotel outside the main floor *are* old, and while in my opinion that adds to the Waldorf's charm, it will not be to the taste of everyone. Taken as a whole, the hotel is probably not as well maintained as a Ritz-Carlton, for instance, would be. However, a room at the Waldorf can be had for vastly less than a comparable room at the Ritz or the Plaza, and frankly, for all that we got for the very good price we paid, I can't see that it would be hugely worth spending the extra money to stay elsewhere. The service we received was beyond reproach, from the concierge who got us last minute dinner reservations at a top New York restaurant to the staff who came to our room and would not accept a tip for their labors. I was disappointed initially, as our room was too dark for my taste; however, when we called, they quickly brought us an extra floor lamp that righted the problem immediately. (A word to the wise--if anything bothers you, simply ask; the staff is extremely kind, and at least in my experience, did everything possible to keep us happy.) Also, I should note that the lobby is often crowded with people and tourists (the Waldorf gives tours), which can be an aggravation; nevertheless, the hotel itself is incredibly quiet, and that never bothered me too much. On the plus side, there was a buzziness to it such that the bars were really fun, and while the drinks were expensive, I loved being able to go down in the evening and take advantage of the free ground-floor wireless internet while sipping a marvelous cocktail and enjoying the nightly piano music. In closing, despite its shortcomings, I absolutely loved the Waldorf, and in spite of what some of the reviews on here would leave you to believe, I would recommend it without reservation."
141,1969,"May 13 2009 	Great location wonderful staff	I loved this hotel. When the staff found out we were celebrating a birthday, they sent a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our room. I love the old world charm of this hotel. The romm was beautiful. I would stay there again!"
