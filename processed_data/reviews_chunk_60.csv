1,1411,"Aug 3 2008 	great location interesting layout but overcharged $50 for key i returned	the whole complex feels like it is dying. very few customers, dont know when the hotel has a front desk person. had to get everything from bartender who didnt know much about what was included in room (telephone internet etc..) found it to be much too expensive and they put a $50 room key deposit on my credit card and didnt take it off when I checked out. so now ive been trying to get ahold of someone for two days now to fix the problem and it seems the bartender is the only one who answers the phone and of course cant do anything about it. i would stay there again if it was $45 a night or less."
2,1411,"Jun 29 2008 	Americans beware	Would not suggest that you stay more than a day or two. My partner and I have been together for 30 yrs. and when we travel we like to explore the areas. The Complex is in a good location, but don't expect to get your room cleaned and you need to ask for extra pillows and clean towels. After a few days though you may want to visit another establishment. You Can expect to be verbally accosted by the staff as 'Stupid Americans'. Farid and Francois were great but only around a short time for the first of our visit. The staff also has a problem with the new owner and morale is low."
3,1411,"Jun 9 2008 	Great Location Good Price Friendly Service	Our room at Hotel Bourbon was clean and well air conditioned; a blessing given the humidex of 37 degrees C (98F) the day we were there. The service is alright, the staff is friendly and the hotel itself is in the heart of the clubs, pubs and restos of Montreal's Gay Village. The front desk is a little disorganized, but they make up for it with friendliness, relaxed atmosphere and reasonable rates. Hell, they even managed to find us a decent room, last minute, on Formula 1 weekend.You won't get mints on your pillow, but rooms have private washrooms, A/C, TV, no phone, but do apparently have free WiFi (we didn't have our laptop with us to check), a few &quot;tester&quot; packs of shampoos and stuff, as well as some clean (although mismatched) towels.It's true, the Bourbon isn't a fancy place...but it's no dreadful dive either. If you're looking for a casual travel experience, decent rooms, affordable rates and being close to everything (including the metro), this is a good hotel to consider. We will be staying there again."
4,1411,"Mar 3 2008 	It's all relative	After spending one night in a DUMP called the Park Hotel in Montreal, I went around looking for a place to stay for the rest of the trip. I got a very sweet deal at Le Bourbon. 700 Canadian Dollars for 20 nights. I payed such a low price because I signed a month long retal lease instead of paying by the night. I was in Montreal for a 3week French course, so I needed a long stay rate.That being said, the special rate came with a few limitations. There was no breakfast included and room service was only once a week. But I had my laundry done for only 5CAN per bag. Since I separate whites from coloureds, it costed me 10CAN each time. I did it twice, so 20CAN to have my clothes washed twice in a 3 week span does not seem unreasonable.I'll admit the hotel is not great, but my room was spacious, TV worked well and bathroom was OK, with complimentary soaps/shampoos. I could stock the minibar with my own food/drink and I got decent (if erratic) public wi-fi internet.The main problems I faced were the noisy air-con and the smallish windows that made the room very hot. But that seems to be a common thing in Montreal. Since everything is built to battle the harsh winters, it can be quite warm indoors even if outside is a comfortable 20C (68F) degrees.Location was very good for me. Not only all the nightlife is at your doorstep, the subway line was the same I used to get to my school. No need to transfer! I would just rush out of the hotel, take a double latte at the local Starbucks, and be at school in about 10 minutes!To sum it up. No, it is not a great hotel, but it worked quite well for my needs and location was great.If they could only updated the hallway carpets!"
5,1411,"Oct 11 2005	Watch your credit card	I made air through Expedia and called the hotel direct. I used the same credit card for both. A week later, an airline called me for credit card authorization for a Shawn Dubec to fly from Chicago to Detroit and back with my credit card number. First of all, the name Dubec sounds French to me and second, I have not had any trouble with Expedia before. Therefore, I seem to think that my credit card unauthorized use came from the hotel through some of its employees. I had requested a double room as I was traveling with a friend. They gave us a room with a double bed. There was no way both of us could sleep in that bed as we are both very mature men (in other words--FAT). They put him in a seperate room that night and eventually let him stay in that room all weekend. His room had air--mine did not. It did have a ceiling fan though. It was around 80 degrees. The room was ok; the halls are bad. I would probably stay there again if I could get away from using my credit card as a guarantee."
6,1411,"Sep 26 2005	Eh.	It was clean enough, and the staff was pleasant and polite. I shared a 2 bedroom suite with a friend. The biggest problem I had is that the hotel will not give you a key to your room, they say they are trying to protect you from being robbed, which has not happened to me in my 25 years of visiting Montreal regularly. The location is great for gay men, it puts you in short walking distance from all of Montreal's night life. Price-wise, the room cost 400 US dollars for EACH of us, for a 4 night stay. You can do better for less, but if location is important, this hotel has that covered! Lastly, parking is a bit inconvenient, it a few blocks away, and you have to pay 15 a night for it."
7,1411,"Aug 19 2005	Hotel Le Bourbon - Not bad but not fantastic	I went to Montreal for gay pride July/August 2005 and stayed at Hotel Le Bourbon. I read the past reviews and was a bit scared. I got there and the hotel clerks were very very nice. I stayed in a 1 bedroom suite room 221. It was cute, a separate bedroom and the living room was on an upper level which faced the back of the hotel. The air conditioning didnt work well at all, the room kind of smelled like dirty socks, the TV got no reception and the phone receiver stuck to the phone when I tried to use it. I complained and was moved quickly to room next door, room 220 another one bedroom suite. This had the living room and bedroom area all on the upper level with only the bathroom on the lower level. It was ok, I liked it because the air unit was close to the bed. Although it was a bit loud it worked and at this point thats all that mattered. My friend stayed in Suite 223. A really nice 2 bedroom suite that had a kick *** air conditioning unit and hardwood floors which faced the bustling street activities. Also a lot of the rooms had a large gap opening at the bottom of the front doors and adjoining doors inside the suites to the other suites from your room. You know like the door was cut about an inch too short at the bottom. This allowed you to hear everything in the hallways and sometimes all the way to the front desk...and also allowed others to hear all your business from your room too. Am I just picking this hotel apart or what? No I am just stating the facts as I found them for others who need to know so they can make up their own mind to stay here or not.The bath house which most of the ad's for this hotel said was still there is gone and they have made more rooms in that space. There is an inside bar right off the lobby which I never saw more then 5 people in and they were mostly playing the machines. There is a bar on the roof top, but I walked up there once and it was dead also so I never went back. There is a 24 cafe - Club Sandwich which was right off the front door of this hotel, which I ate at and was not really too impressed, it was ok but not really busy either. Yes, the hallway carpets are still gross as so stated in many previous posts but I am not staying in the hallway so who really cares. The maid will not intrude on you to clean your room and will only come in if you have the clean room sign out, so if you dont hang it out don't expect them to knock or visit at all, they will simply leave you alone until you request it.I was kind of shocked at how dead this place was for gay pride. I expected it to be packed with people but I barely saw about 5 guests in my five day stay, so apparently there are other hot spots to stay at. This is in the center of a great area with eateries and bars everywhere. The very popular SKY bar with 4 levels and a great rooftop area is about 50 feet from the hotel.I do not think I would stay here again just because the price for my suite was about 150.00 American and I really didnt think my room was worth it, although the 2 bedroom suite rocked and was well worth the price if you have a travel buddy. I think Montreal probably has a lot better places to stay that are a bit more fun and lively. This place seems to have had its day and that day seems to have past, which is a shame. Gay Pride 2005 and the hotel was so dead and quite...yea...this hotel has seen its day. There are some great restaurants on St Catherine that had some great food. Also some of the strippers at the bars were extremely hot. $10.00 for a private dance. The bars were fun, the Casino was fun and the experience of Montreal was fun but the hotel...not so much.Well thats my experience anyway:)CheersChip"
8,1411,"Dec 7 2004	a hotel in the midst of everything	I did a tour of this hotel this past weekend, Dec 4, 2004. I found the rooms to be well eqquipped with fridges, microwaves and very clean.the suites had jacuzzi tubs in the master bedroom and leather sofas and settees in the living rooms. The prices were very reasonable especially when you compare them to the major chains.I have only 2 concerns. The hallway carpet has seen better days. It is not torn but is worn and dirty. However they are in the midst of construction and improvements. The rooms have all been redone recently. This accounts for the worn hallway carpet. As I was told, there is no use replacing it while all this construction is being done.The only other concern I have is that some of the rooms' windows overlook some of the outdoor terraces. This is not a problem in winter when there is no one outside, but in summer there might be a problem with noise. The bars close at 3 am so if you have people outside on the terrace drinking until 3 you may not be able to sleeep.The hotel is located in a complex that includes a large restaurant with many outdoor terraces. a disco, several bars, a billiard and internet room. The staff is The complex is located in the heart of the gay village of Montreal so it is close to all bars, boutiques, video stores, strip clubs, and bathhouses. Also for touring the city, it is close to the subway station and from there one can travel across the whole city. The subway is fast, quiet, safe and affordable."
9,1411,"Aug 19 2004	on it's last legs	I have stayed at the Bourbon frequently over the past 20 years. Over the past 5 years or so management has let it deteriorate to the point where I will never stay there again. It is always in a state of construction, never busy, the sauna has been eliminated, and the structure is a wreck. I stayed there this past weekend (August 2004) for one night. The room was not made up at check in. The toilet was broken and not fixed by the time I moved in, despite calling the defect to the attention of the staff. There was exposed wiring where a ceiling fixture used to be. The bathroom door wouldn't lock, and the ceiling was cracked all the way accross. Not to mention that the room smelled badly. The Bourbon's prices are above comparable gay lodging in the immediate vicinity. Their restaurants are always empty, and it is apparent that the owners are committed to letting the facility fall apart. Every room I have had over the past 5 years there has been horrible, but I always hoped there would be a turnaround. There hasn't been, so they well never get another dollar of my money. Stay ANYWHERE else but here!"
10,1411,"Jul 24 2004	Is this a bath house?	I am from Montreal but I moved Many years ago. I went to Montreal in June and stayed at Hotel Le Bourbon, What a dive!!! DIRTY, dirty and dirty, this hotel is simply dirty and I think that the owner doesn't care because this place is in the heart of the village but next time I wil live out of the village and sleep in a clean place. It is a good place if you want a cheep thrill because the hotel is like a bath house where every body is hitting on every body, people are going from room to room, not a place for a monogamous couple. Big rooms but cleaning staff under paid and not trained one told me that he was paid cash and collect welfare so you see what type of owner runs this place.Never again"
11,1411,Jul 19 2004	Great	We stayed with a group of friends and really enjoyed it. The location was great with everything there..it made it worthwile. The Holiday weekend was great with a view of fireworks over the bridge from the rooftop.
12,1411,"Jul 6 2004	Great Location - Needs Paint Carpeting Cleaning	A group of us went up for the July 4th weekend. We decided to book at the Bourbon based on their website and great location. We did read the trip advisor ratings of this propery well after we booked our trip and were a bit concerned over the cleanliness, but decided as a group that we would &quot;check it out&quot; for ourselves. I am always amazed on how bad a place can be in the heart of a gay community where we as a segment of the population always likes and demands better. Here is our critique. We had a large suite and a junior suite. Both suites were spacious with lots of room. The larger suite's AC was broken all weekend. The cooler weather made it bearable. Both suites could use new carpeting, as the stains are becoming more numerous then the actual color of the rug. Linens and curtains should be replaced as they have seen better days. New paint would make both suites better and the hotel a much better place to stay. The cleaning staff should be re-trained or even trained and probably paid better as they can do a much better job at cleaning. The hallway carpeting should be ripped up and replaced either with new carpeting or tile. It's just sooo dirty, that the red color is now more a black carpet that is tinted red. We have certainly stayed at worst places in different cities, but at a much cheaper price. At the Bourbon Montreal, you are paying a premium for the location and not for the condition of the hotel. If cleanliness is a concern, the Bourbon Montreal is not for you.A few words of advice for the owners. I would remove the word luxury from all of our brochures and website. I would remove the pictures of the rooms and really just show more of a diagram of the rooms. People will get the wrong impression from your pictures. You should also look into redoing the rooms. Gay people will pay an even bigger premium knowing that they are not only get a GREAT location, but really decent room as well."
13,1411,"Apr 26 2004	Great Location Decent Accommodations	I stayed at the Hotel Bourbon for 3 nights in April 2004. The Bourbon is in a great location for anyone, but particularly for gay travelers because it's right in the middle of the city's largest strip of gay bars, cafes, etc. In addition, it's only about a mile or a short subway ride (2 stations within a few blocks of the hotel) from the center of downtown and the tons of shopping there. Plus it's also a 10-15 minute walk from the Old Montreal tourist/restaurant area on the river.As for the hotel itself, my room was clean, but not spotless. But the things that didn't pass my white glove test were not alarming. One thing I didn't like was that the only window in the room was actually a glass door that led to a deck shared with several other rooms. This meant that I could only air the room out when I was in the room and awake. Be aware that the hotel is part of a large complex that includes several restaurants. When I went to bed Saturday at 4 AM, music from the pub downstairs was still pretty loud. It was drowned out when I turned on the air, but who knows if that always works. One nice feature is that my room (and another that I saw) had a mini fridge. I'm sure the rates go up during the peak summer tourist season, but my pre-high season rate of $85/night (Canadian, not incl. tax) was a pretty good value considering the location. By the way, another thing that wasn't well-publicized while I was there is that most or all of your hotel tax will be refunded to you upon your depature at the airport/train station (or by mail) if you submit a form with your hotel receipt. So save that receipt!"
14,1411,"Mar 10 2004	Simple accomodations friendly discreet staff	I've been to Montreal four times in the past two years, the last time was in November of 2003. I've always stayed at Hotel Bourbon Complex. It's centrally located in the heart of the gay area of Ste. Catherine Street. The rooms are clean and simple. At least one of the restaurants in the complex is open 24 hours. I've never been there in the summer but I'm sure the view from the rooftop bar overlooking Ste. Catherine must be very nice. I've also felt very comfortable bringing acquaintances back to my room. The only thing I think they should make people aware of is that some of the single rooms don't have completely private bathrooms. Otherwise I find the accomodations satisfactory."
15,1411,"Feb 4 2004	Cute Place in the center of it all	I stayed there for 3 nights in a &quot;single&quot; and you can't beat it for the price, the room was a nice size, very clean, and had a balcony. and its right dead center of everything , The concierge people were very sweet as well as the friendly bartender Simon. I would definately stay there again!!"
16,1411,"Dec 8 2003	what a difference	Stayed at the Bourbon Oct 2002 and It was ok. Stayed at the Bourbon Dec. 2003 and what a difference. The place was spotless many items looked to have been upgraded since last year,could not find any fault with the Bourbon. Staff was very friendly. I myself think that people don't realize that when you have the amount of people coming into a place as the Bourbon does that you can continually sweep the carpets so they look new all the time. You could clean a place 24 hours a day and someone would find fault with it. I myself will be staying at the Bourbon again and telling all my friends to stay there,oh by the way my buddy found no fault with the place either. But then I don't have to be catered to as some do."
17,1411,"Oct 11 2003	Hotel filth	OH MY GOD. I stayed there 2 years ago and thought it was decent. I returned July 4th weekend 2003 and it seemed to have gone downhill. The carpets were total filth. There was a used condom in the waste basket in my friends room. In general they are friendly, but you would think the would at least vaccuum the carpets at least once a year! There was dark stains and filth that was apparently not new."
1,1415,Jun 10 2008	Cute Place	Just got back from Canada. Drove up for a bachlorette. Some people stayed at family house
2,1415,May 12 2008	Unique!!	This hotel is the perfect hotel for a &quot;romantic&quot; evening. I have been there several times. It is a very unique concept. Book a theme room
3,1415,Aug 2 2007 	Been here many times and planning to go again	I have been to this Hotel 4 times in my life and had 5 of my friends go and loved every minute of it. We have rented a regular room
4,1415,Jul 30 2006	Perfect!	I just came back from a trip to Hemmingford (parc safari). Since we live in Quebec city we decided to sleep somewhere close to montreal for 1 night. I've searched for and hotel for more than 2 months and found the best place to stay near montreal
5,1415,Feb 12 2009	débile!!		
1,1419,Sep 25 2009 	VERY BAD BREAKFAST	regular room very bad breakfast food was scarce and rubber seemed good location and room for parking. NOT RECOMMEND
2,1419,"Sep 22 2009 	Quaint Hotel Great Service but it is still a 2 star...	The truth is this hotel is great for people who just want a clean basic bed and bath. Furthermore, the staff we encountered was truly the best we have ever encountered (especially Raphael). Helpful &amp; kind, Rapheal went out of his way to make our stay comfortable and was great with tips about the area. However, it is a small hotel with small rooms; furthermore while it is in a perfect location in Montreal the street it is on is not the most picturesque.P.S . The chocolate croissants for breakfast were yummy."
3,1419,"Sep 22 2009 	I made reservations for November	We travel to Montral four times a year for vacation. This was the second time we stayed here and have made reservations for November/December. The price is great and includes parking and breakfast. The location is perfect for us, near the Berri/UQAM Metro. We use it or walk to the Downtown, Old Montral, Mont Royal or Village districts. It is also near the Library and Archives if you are doing genealogy research. Yes if you want a luxury hotel, look elsewhere. But if looking for a good location and a good price, this is a good choice."
4,1419,"Sep 9 2009 	Definitely a ""discount"" choice	Not a nightmare or anything, but definitely a cheap 2-star hotel.- Online photos are very deceptive. Rooms are small, simple, kind of boring.- Beds are terrible, really uncomfortable. No extra pillows.- Bathrooms: okay- It's on a busy street. If your room faces the street, drunks leaving the bars could wake you up.- There's air conditioning for the whole floor, but can't control the A/C in your room independently.If you're not picky and are the type of person that can fall asleep anywhere, you won't care. But if you're like me and you want a comfy bed and some real quiet, pay the extra 25/night for another hotel."
5,1419,"Sep 8 2009 	Good choice	I stayed at the Manoir Des Alpes for two nights with my partner. I thought it was perfect. The rooms have nice high ceilings and seem quite clean. The location is very good. right near the gay Village, but not noisy. It's also close to Old Montreal. The breakfast was very good too..cereal, bagels, toast etc. and is on offer until 11 a.m. So altogether a good experience, if you don't want luxury."
6,1419,"Aug 9 2009 	Great as a stopping point between sights	The hotel has seen better days no question, but the rooms were clean, the breakfast was ample, and the price was right. From here you are walking distance to Old Montreal (10 minutes), Molson Stadium (30 minutes brisk pace), and when we went Just for Laughs was on. You're about 5 minutes away fro St. Denis St. which is where all that takes place. If you're looking to stay in the lap of luxury, go somewhere else. If you want somewhere to keep your bags and sleep, this is it. BTW water pressure is good and very hot so be careful."
7,1419,"Jul 24 2009 	Not a 3 Star Hotel	This hotel displays the 3 star plaque outside the front entrance, but in comparison to other hotels in Quebec, this rating is definitely a mistake. The room we had was very shabby, with crooked walls, haphazard construction, with a typical roadside hotel comforter and bathroom accessories. The staff was nice enough, and the breakfast was ok, but the overall design, feel and experience was definitely a 2 star hotel. I don't know if this deserves a 'value' rating here....you pay for what you get in this case."
8,1419,"Jul 18 2009 	YOUR STUFF WILL GET STOLEN! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!	YOUR STUFF WILL GET STOLEN FROM THE PARKING LOT!!!! They smashed the window and took my stuff. I told the front desk clerk and he said &quot;Really? The clerk last night was supposed to check the parking lot every 20 minutes&quot;Well obviously, he didn't do his job!Asked him if the Hotel would cover my loss, he said that the hotel is not responsible for their own parking lot?This hotel makes you pay for everything when you CHECK IN, NOT when you check out.The room was small and you have to ask the front desk clerk to turn on the air conditioning, you can't control it from within the room. It is an old hotel, no computer, they use a log in book, no key cards, they usual actual keys. You can hear everything from your room, dim lighting, old crappy TV and obviously a BAD area since people break into people's cars. Small room, just terrible hotel!You get what you pay for. Do yourself a favour and pay an extra 20bucks per night for a hotel chain in downtown Montreal that provides SECURITY and good service."
9,1419,"Jul 8 2009 	Good enough	I stayed with my husband for 2 nights at this hotel. It is not a luxury hotel, but it is very clean, confortable and the staff is friendly. The guy at the front desk speaks English and helped us a lot with directions to the places I wanted to visit. Parking is free and so is breakfast. The breakfast is not huge; just an assortment of breads/bagels/croissants/muffins; cereal; orange juice and coffee. Don't be expecting to have omelettes, bacon and sausage because its just continental breakfast. Yes, they charge your card at time of check in, not at check out. I guess basically because since the parking and breakfast are free and the room doesn't have a mini bar nor they have room service, there is nothing else to charge other than the room. Location was fine because it has easy access to the different places we wanted to see. Its right on St. Catherine (they had an art exhibit on the street when we were there), walking distance to Old Montreal and they have a metro station steps away from the hotel.I would love to go back to Montreal. Would I go back there? yes, if I go back just with my husband. If I go back with my kids I would probably stay somewhere else only because the location although convenient, looks a little seedy to be walking around with children.So if you go with other adults, and want to save some money to spend it in the wide range of great restaurants and bars in Montreal you'll be fine staying here.Oh! I forgot to say the rooms have good Wi-Fi, and its also free."
10,1419,"Jul 2 2009 	Not three stars	I'm not sure who wrote the prevous reviews, but my husband and I, along with 2 friends, booked 2 rooms at te Manoir des Alpes and we were sorely disappointed. I bookd the hotel based on the rave reviews in tripadvisor. However, I should have been warned when all of the reviews spoke of how &quot;clean&quot; the place is. Yes, it is clean, but it is far from 3-star quality. We got what was billed as a &quot;better&quot; room, with a queen bed (which really was a double bed), and a single bed. Half the room had hardwood floors and half the room had some sort off outdated tile. Our room opened to the outside alley via a big metal door. The bathroom,while clean, was from the 60s, and lighting in the room was dim, to say the least. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is a budget hotel that deserves on star at most. The breakfast offered consists of coffee, tea, orange juice and some breads. We went out for breakfast after drinking some coffee. For those on a severe budget, this hotel is fine, as long as they don't expect 3-star quality."
11,1419,"Jun 11 2009 	Diamond in the rough	Not exactly what we had set our sights on, but the hotel and the staff turned out to be one of our best experiences in Montreal. It has a very friendly atmosphere, and you feel as though you've stepped back in time. Rooms are extremely clean and comfortable, with modern bathrooms. Most of all, we were amazed at the service we received. Definitely a place I would go back to."
12,1419,"May 28 2009 	Excellent!	The staff was very helpful and accommodating. For example: I was not going to be able to make it to the Hotel by check-in time. I called them to let them know, and was told: &quot;no problem&quot;.The room I stayed in for 6 nights, was really nice. The different types of muffins they had were delicious. They were part of the choices, for their continental breakfast. I like the idea of free parking. The location is nice."
13,1419,Apr 16 2009 	Great staff clean and convenient hotel	We booked 4 rooms in early April and had a great stay. The rooms varied in size but were very clean and the staff was excellent. Everyone we encountered over the 3 days were extremely helpful and friendly.Great value!
14,1419,"Apr 14 2009 	Wonderful little hotel with friendly staff	We stayed three nights for a weekend concert event at the L'Olympia theatre, which was within just a couple of blocks. Without exception, the staff was friendly and accommodating. The bedroom and bathroom were both immaculate, and during the chilly early spring season the room was cozy and warm. The side street the hotel is located on was quiet at night and we both slept very soundly. We would definitely visit again."
15,1419,"Apr 14 2009 	Very Clean Very Quaint Very Convenient	Montreal is full of so-called &quot;small hotels&quot; which are kind of a cross between a regular hotel and a smaller bed and breakfast. They often provide a free breakfast and have personal service, but they are larger and the rooms are more like regular hotel rooms than foofy b&amp;b bedrooms. These are often mom and pop outfits and can be of varying quality. On a recent trip to Montreal, our stay at the Manoir des Alpes was well worth the price: a clean, quiet, moderately appointed room, continental breakfast with many varieties of baked goods, friendly courteous staff, and best of all, more than ample parking -- which is difficult to find at a moderate priced hotel in Montreal. The location is great, it was one block from the Olympiad, a theater on St. Catherine street. Old Montreal is a 10 minute walk, and the contemporary art museum, the Bay department store and many other local attractions are within walking distance. In addition, the hotel is a block from the Beri-Uqam subway stop making it very easy to get around the city from this terrific location. We were very happy with the price and accomodations and will make this our first choice when planning future trips to Montreal."
16,1419,"Apr 8 2009 	Exactly what I was looking for	Great location. The staff was friendly, helpful and accommodating. Very quiet. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend them. I will stay there again."
17,1419,"Feb 7 2009 	Rent by the Hour!!!!	The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it was very clean. It reminded me of the type of hotel you see on the TV that rents by the hour - very noisy at night with lots of people wandering around - need I say more?? Small rooms, very 70&quot;s in style and I would say it hasn't seen a coat of paint since the 70's either. It was quite seedy. A good central location but I would never go back there again or recomend it to anyone."
18,1419,"Feb 7 2009 	Not bad for a weekend in Montreal!	We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights back in 2007 during an Easter Weekend. It was a last minute booking that I made over the phone directly with the hotel.I remember that compare with other hotels in the area this one was one of the few still available in our budget (about $100 per night).The room was clean, nothing fancy and met our expectations, since we were driving around Montreal and visiting places we just needed a place to sleep. The breakfast included was usual continental breakfast but it was all we needed.Parking was included as well, at the back of the building.As the person on the previous review said, if you avoid walking too far left on Rue St.Catherine as you come out of St. Andre from the hotel, you should be fine."
19,1419,"Oct 13 2008 	Clean and convinient	We had reservations (pun :-) against this hotel after we had booked. The rates (115$ incl taxes - Thanks giving weekend price) seemed a little outside our budget and we were concerned about getting a raw deal. Needless to say our expectations were low. We had drawn alternate plans, in case the room fell below our expectations. The room turned out to be just fine. We looked for cockraches (as some of the other reviews claimed, had found, but found none :-). The room was smallish, yet spacious for our needs. The furniture consisted of a writing desk and a wooden cabinet and cloth hanger. The breakfast is modest, nothing fancy. The staff was friendly and helpful. As you come out of St.Andre to the left there are some sex shops. That might be a consideration if you plan to do some walking with kids in the evenings. But if you avoid walking too far left on Rue St.Catherine as you come out of St. Andre from the hotel, you should be fine.  There are two big pluses to this place - (a). It's location, off Rue St. Catherine is close to both the old city and downtown. The subway (Berri UQAM) and bus station are right around the corner. (b). Free parking in the downtown area. We found later that the hotel is rated in the Official Montreal city guide as a '* * *'."
20,1419,"Sep 3 2008	Good place to crash park	This was my second stay at the hotel. It's a good value if you are driving to Montreal and do not want to be slave of your car after your arrival. I tend to leave my car and take metro at Berri-Uquam or walk. It is small, old school (room keys are actually keys, reservation book is actually a book), beds are hard (some people don't like that), not handicap accessible. There are a lot of homeless close to the hotel around the metro station, but not on the street of the hotel. I have stayed there total 7 nights in the past year and left/arrived that area on foot late in the night and didn't feel threatened. It is very clean for an old hotel and they provide continental breakfast. It's not the best but there is variety. They have supermarket waffles with fake syrup, muffins, Montreal bagels, croissant, cereal, whole and white bread (bagged supermarket variety) good coffee and OJ. If you just want to start your day but not a feast, that works for me. Both times I've stayed in the parking lot side, which was quiet. Corridor walls are not, so you do hear people coming late in to their rooms. Hot water pressure is good. Operable pane of the window was small so we used AC in the fan mode, otherwise small room tends to get stuffy. I would recommend this place if you want a clean bed to come to after a busy day in the city, where you know you can park your car and have free breakfast, all in budget. I would not recommend for people with kids, or romantic getaways."
21,1419,"May 27 2008 	Very overpriced run-down and small	This hotel is extremely small and old. Furnishings are from the '70s and the place looks like it hasn't been renovated in decades. They made our reservation for the wrong week, then argued with us when we arrived (as if it were our fault). Noisy at night, and the breakfast was stale breads and instant coffee. Very disappointed, since we paid $120 for a room that was only worth, in our opinion, one star. The next night we stayed a few blocks away for $65 and got a large suite. I really wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, unless everything else is booked."
22,1419,"May 4 2008 	A bit disappointed	I've stayed here several times before (last stay: November 2007) and, generally speaking, have always enjoyed it. However, this time, it seemed to me that owner and staff have reached what I would call the &quot;threshold of indifference.&quot; Perhaps it comes with being in the business for quite some time, as the owners of the Manoir have been. A modicum of welcome and no interest at all in whether I enjoyed my stay. Key left and that's that. A further irritation was the cigarette smoke -- though rooms are all supposed to be non-smoking. Though I complained about the smoke (which sat in my room until the open window finally cleared the smell in the small hours), I was given the impression that there was little interest in doing much about it. This trip a definite disappointment -- and I will certainly think twice about returning. A shame."
23,1419,"Feb 15 2008 	Decent Hotel on a Budget	Hi everyone!I have stayed at this hotel so many times, that I have lost count of the number of stays I've had here.The location is outstanding. It is in the heart of the gay village. One of the biggest problems I have is that because the price is reasonable, the rooms are clean, and the service is excellent, there tends to be a contingent of budget travelling families. (Not that there is anything wrong with that.) Some of these families tend to let the kids run wild in the halls, thus disturbing that much needed early evening disco nap that you (don't try to deny it!) and I need before going out to play for the evening.Gripe #2 in the same vein, is that you get a lot of youngish travellers who whoop it up pre and post party time. In fact, once, I don't think the party kids even made it out the door, and the jams that were going on when I left, were STILL going on when I came back at 5am. Christ in a Cab! I've stayed here 100's of times. I have never once seen a bug, and the rooms are scrubbed to spotless perfection each day. The staff is ALWAYS accommodating, friendly and polite. In fact, the owner pushed me out of a snow bank early one morning, when I was stuck! (I was in my car, goofy!)The continental breakfast is good enough if you are in a rush. I'm not a fan of hotel eats, take me someplace off the beaten track! Speaking of, there is a petit plethora of restaurants in the area (Mike's, St. Huber). Please don't disappoint me by eating at these places, when you are a just short trot away from places like Cora, Le Saloon, and Piccolo Diavolo. Ahem. Bottom line, a clean, convenient, decent place to stay for the single traveller who can deal with a few, generally noise related issues, and the traveller who doesn't require a chic, modern looking hotel."
24,1419,"Nov 13 2007 	Not What I Expected!	I just returned from a weekend trip to Montreal, and I have to say, this place is not what I expected...AT ALL. To be fair, let me first say that if you're looking for an extremely basic place to sleep for the night, want to be close to everything, are very tight on money, and don't care what type of environment you sleep in, then this might be the place for you.We (my hubby &amp; infant daughter) wanted a place that would be in the heart of everything, near the metro, have free parking &amp; breakfast, and have a good deal on the price. It had all of that, but I was very misled by the looks of their website, and unfortunately, some of the reviews here (then again, it could have been my perception).When we drove into the area, I thought to myself, &quot;Uh oh.&quot; I knew it was kind of a seedy area from the reviews, but it was way more so than I thought. I grew up in a city, but didn't expect the hotel to be in surroundings as such from their website. Although there were plenty of restaurants open at night nearby (St. Hubert, Mike's, etc.), the area was more of a college/20-something scene. If you've got little kids, be aware that there's a 'peep show' place right down the block.OK, I'm really not trying to make this review sound very negative, but as I was saying, I was misled by the website, which makes things look very inviting and spacious. When I walked in through the entrance, I was surprised by how cramped the place was. It smelled of cigarette smoke (one of the two owners was puffing away despite the &quot;thank you for not smoking&quot; sign less than 3 feet away from him). Their &quot;reservation system&quot; was a notebook and pen, and they gave me a photocopied slip of paper to put on our car's dashboard for identification purposes (there was no attendant from what I could see). They also billed my credit card as soon as we arrived, rather than when we checked-out.The owners were friendly, and initially gave us a room with a queen and a twin, thinking that we would put my daughter on it at some point. But the room was so dark, cramped, and cold (corner room with two windows, and an emergency door leading outside) , I initially thought we might have to find another place to spend the night. The bathroom was better than the room, but I still didn't feel comfortable having my litte one sleep somewhere where it was so cold. And it didn't help that it seemed like this was a place where some people spent the night for a &quot;quickie&quot;, if you know what I mean.I asked for another room, and he said he only had one other left. It was even tinier and more cramped than the first, but at least the feel of the room was a little better, and the lighting was brighter. To give you an idea of how cramped it was, you couldn't move around in the room unless you closed the door. My daughter didn't have anywhere to crawl around. I kind of felt like we were a family that just lost all their belongings and had to resort to desperate means for a night or two. Hubby was kind of mad, told me never to trust review ratings again, and to stick with trusted budget motel names. :(Before going, when I read all the reviews about the ample breakfast selections, I thought that would at least make me feel better the following day. Not so. It was a pretty basic continental breakfast: croissants, chocolate pastry, bagels, cereal, coffee, and hot chocolate. The owner brought me a glass of orange juice, but I didn't have the heart to tell him I have acid reflux and it wasn't good for me. :) Overall, I wouldn't stay here again, nor would I recommend anyone (other than the single, budget traveler) to stay here. I just didn't like the feel of the place, even though the owners were friendly, and did assist us when we needed help with finding a late-night delivery place. They're nice, but it's just that the place isn't so nice for a young family. Unfortunately, it totally ruined our trip."
25,1419,"Nov 2 2007 	Really very nice hotel!	This hotel is a very cute place to stay. Well located, near the subway and bus terminal, easy to go walking to all the city, even to the Biodome and surroundings (which are far from the city, about 1 hour walking). Prices are very nice to Montreal hotels. Room is very comfortable, clean, cute, bathroom with whirlpooll, and hair drier. Breakfast is delicious, with muffins, croissants, waffles, milk, orange juice, butter, jam, chocolate cake....very good! Front desk staff is very polite and solicitous. I really recommend this hotel!"
26,1419,"Oct 8 2007 	A Great Bargain in every way	I don't do much traveling, but I do visit Montreal about twice a year and I always stay at this hotel. $85.00 a night, includes Parking! In many places you would pay almost that amount just for the parking. Make no mistake however you are not getting 4 Seasons luxury at these prices, but it is clean and comfortable and friendly and convenient. Located just off St. Catherine in the Gay Village. Nightlife, which is what I'm there for, is located right around the corner. Yet the area around the hotel is generally very quiet. It's true that Montreal has a serious pan handler problem, not just in this neighborhood, but they are considerably less aggressive than the pan handlers in San Francisco whom I did find to be truly obnoxious and aggressive. One recommendation I would make to the management. It would be great if you supplied &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; signs that people could hang from their doorknobs. When I visit Montreal I frequently stay out all night and don't get to bed until after breakfast. Although I will usually ask the desk clerk to let housekeeping know that I don't want to be disturbed and they should skip my room I still often end up having to jump up from bed when they try to come into the room. I would sleep much better if I felt a little more secure about not being disturbed."
27,1419,"Sep 12 2007 	Highly Recommended	Staff is friendly, rooms are smallish but spotless. Next time well pay the extra $10 for 2 beds, if only to get the bigger room. Plenty of free parking. Good breakkie and a lovely dining area. Free WiFi that works well. Short 10 min walk to both of our favorite places: Vieux Montreal and Rue St. Denis. Grocery and liquor stores 1 block away. Major subway hub is 3 min walk. Neighborhood is borderline sketchy but not bad. Gf was fine with it, and she's picky. Anyway, one block and you're into the good section. At $102 USD including tax on Labor Day weekend, very reasonable. We stayed 4 nights.The 2 very negative posts below, obviously penned by the same hand under different names, should be ignored. I would normally have preferred to keep this hotel a best kept secret, but decided to weigh-in to help set the record straight, out of fairness .Our must do's in Montreal: Jardin Nelson in Vieux Montreal (great setting, food and service).Eduardo's restaurant on St. Denis (Italian, cheap, delish, clientele largely local, byob).Botanical Garden.Little Italy. A &quot;steamy&quot; hot dog &quot;all dressed.&quot; Skippable: The smoked beef sambo at Schwartz's Deli (St. Laurent). We didn't like it. Most people disagree with us, so if it sounds like your style, fall in line and try one."
28,1419,"Sep 4 2007 	Good value clean convenient area a little dodgy	I stayed here with my boyfriend for 3 nights over Labor Day weekend 2007. The hotel is very convenient (free parking - there were still plenty of slots available when we arrived late Friday night/early Saturday morning at 1:30am) and easy to find. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and the breakfast is good. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that the surrounding area is a little dodgy at night, but nothing that would turn me off going there again by any means. The location is really convenient, but if some beggars and late night revellers give you a fright then I wouldnt recommend it."
29,1419,"Aug 24 2007 	Not bad but watch the location!	Not a bad stay, a pretty good value... especially the free parking. For some reason one night the hotel turned off the air conditioning just after midnight. A little annoying, but they turned it right back on when I called and asked about it. The biggest warning, however, is that this hotel is located very near a rather seedy area off St Catherine's. Since this was my first visit to Montreal, I wasn't sure about the specifics of that location... not really family friendly. Not unsafe mind you, just not what I expected. But if you know that going into it, and don't mind, then this place is a good find."
30,1419,Aug 22 2007 	Ok basic budget hotel	My husband and I recently stayed here for two nights in August. The room was very basic but clean and the staff was very nice. The free parking is a great asset in Montreal- and part of the reason that I booked the room. The location is pretty central - but not in a very nice area of St. Catherine's. I was unpleasantly surprised by the number of strung-out beggars in the area- some who were rather aggressive. We always took a cab back to the hotel at night. I personally would not feel very comfortable walking this area at night- and I have lived in NYC and other urban areas. The hotel itself was fine- but the location left something to be desired.
31,1419,"Aug 12 2007 	Basic No-Frills Hotel in Convenient Location	My husband and I stayed here almost a week and found it to be a good bargain in a very convenient location. We had reserved a room with a queen bed for a very reasonable price, but when we arrived we were given a room with only a double bed. This room was rather small and worn in places, but seemed clean and functional. The price was even cheaper than what we had originally reserved, so we stuck with the double bed since we would not spend that much time in the room anyway.As budget travelers, we did not expect or require many amenities, although we did notice that several items we typically saw in 3-star hotels were not available here (there was no safe, no alarm clock, no fridge). As others have mentioned, there is no elevator, but we had very few bags so it was not a problem even though we stayed on the third (and top) floor. The free breakfast -- in a charmingly set up area -- was quite filling, with many bagels, croissants, danishes and cereal to choose from (although my husband wished for one or two healthier options like fruit or yogurt). There was also free parking and free wireless internet, although we didn't make use of either. The staff was generally friendly and helpful.The hotel is a short walk from the central Berri-UQAM metro station, which provides access to 3 of Montreal's 4 subway lines. (We bought weekly metro passes, and staying at this hotel made transportation incredibly easy.) The hotel is also fairly close to rue St. Denis, which is filled with restaurants, and even the Old Montreal neighborhood is not far away (we walked there when we had the energy).Overall, we had a good experience, and the combination of price and location makes the hotel ideal for a budget-conscious traveler who does not want to stray too far from the city sights."
32,1419,"Jul 28 2007 	Downtown Convenience	My wife and I came here to visit Montreal and for the Police concert. We chose this hotel for its location and the value that it provided. Check in is at 1pm. Got free parking, which is a big plus Downtown Montreal. Outside blends in with the street architecture. Inside is clean. Staff is welcoming and friendly and can provide information upon request. There is no a/c in the hallways which makes it stuffy if hot outside. Inside the room a/c is very quiet and has multiple settings. The decor is a mixture of cottage, French and a bit of the 80s. Bathroom and room are clean, which is all you need when you're sightseeing in the city and don't get to your room until midnight. Rooms are not large by any means. Ours had a queen size bed. Very close to the Metro and St. Cathrines St, and walking distance to Old Montreal. If you are driving, you might want to bring your own pillow as these pillows are very soft, like pancakes. Also, the mattress is very soft, for those of us that appreciate a harder one. For those of us who want to spend our money in the city, this hotel will be good to your wallet."
33,1419,"Mar 15 2007 	Great location	My friend and I recently visited Montreal and stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. We were a little weary due to some of the bad reviews on here but they're all unfounded. The room price was very cheap, the room was a good size, very clean and well kept, the free breakfast had a variety of pastries, bagels etc..., free parking was a bonus especially in Montreal and it's very close to Sainte Catherine street and a 5 minute walk from Old Montreal. We had a great time there, the staff was very friendly and accomodating, I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again!"
34,1419,"Mar 10 2007 	Heartwarmed	My girlfriend and I spent three nights in this exceptionally pleasanthotel. Rarely do good price, good location, great service, and pleasant atmosphere combine under one roof--and they've done it. We stayed there a whole eight months ago and still talk about how nice it was. The staff was friendly and cordial, and the manager was grandfather-esque. Bizarrely there were many oversized mirrors everywhere, including in our small (but cozy!) room, though you couldsay they only served to magnify the charm. As others have mentioned, the location, at the price you're paying, is pretty unbeatable--and for those with a car, the hotel has its own parking lot. We wholeheartedly recommend this place, and we'll be back, I hope."
35,1419,"Oct 26 2006 	Great Family hotel	A few weeks ago, my husband and I decided to make a last-minute getaway to Montreal (his first trip to Canada) and after reading many reviews hear, decided to try this place. They did have a room for 3 available on short notice and at a reasonable price. (Montreal does seem a lot more expensive to me than it did on my last trip in the 80's). Anyway, the hotel is great, the management super-friendly and helpful and the rooms spotlessly clean. I've never seen such a clean bathroom. I really can't understand all these negative reviews. Our room was perfect for us with a queen bed in the main room and a twin in kind of an alcove. There was free wi-fi access and cable tv and everyone enjoyed the breakfast buffet, especially the Montreal bagels. The hotel is also very convenient to everything and two blocks from a major metro stop, but also on a quiet street. If we decide to go to Montreal again I would definitely stay again at this hotel."
36,1419,"Oct 26 2006 	Gem of a find!	I spend two nights at Hotel Manoir and had a wonderful experience. Granted I was in Montreal to see Montreal not to sit in my hotel room, but it was lovely anyway. The room was small but meticulously clean and well organized. Lovely hardwood flooring in the room and great service. The breakfast in the morning is basic - pastries, croissants, coffee, juice so it 's good for a quick bite before hitting the road. Caveat - there is no elevator to the second floor so if you're older or have massive luggage it may not be the ideal choice. It is the absolute best for younger folks flying in for a weekend, or couples getting away. Can't beat the location to price ratio. It's literally several feet away from Rue St. Catherine where you want to start all your touring. Great place!"
37,1419,"Oct 25 2006 	A perfect choice!	I was almost discouraged from staying at this hotel by two negative reviews on TripAdvisor. Thank goodness I trusted the other positive reviews! This hotel is a gem. It's affordable to begin with, but when you factor in the free offstreet parking and expansive continental breakfast, it's an absolute bargain. It's perfectly clean and the old world decor is very charming. The staff was courteous and friendly and helpfully (for us) bilingual. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
38,1419,"Jun 27 2006	Wonderful little find!	We JUST got back from a 5 night stay at this hotel and it was wonderful! It's right near UQAM (and just a few blocks from the Berri-UQAM metro stop), and only about a 15-20 minute walk to Old Montreal. It's off of St Catherine, which is THE spot for after hours clubs, but oddly you would never know it if you weren't planning to hit those joints. St Andre street is quiet, and we didn't hear a peep outside any night - got wonderful nights' sleep. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious enough (it's not the Ritz, after all), the room and bathroom very clean, and the staff friendly and helpful. You get a complimentary breakfast every AM (coffee, juice and muffins/cereal/croissants - nothing fancy, but as much as you want). This was a perfect home base if you're going up to check out the city. Note: the bath towels were a little flimsy and small (I use massive plush bath towels at home). Over all, I highly recommend if you don't have to be pampered and are looking for a good $$ deal."
39,1419,Sep 9 2005	I really enjoyed this hotel.	I always enjoy my stay at this hotel. The rooms are very clean and cheery. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast is a plus. It's great to stay in the heart of the French Quarter. The Metro is just a couple of blocks away so you have easy access to the entire city. The price is very reasonable.
40,1419,"Jun 16 2005	We came we saw we loved it!	The hotel was recommended to us by friends of ours who go there regularly and always talk about Montreal and that little place they enjoy so much. We gave it a try.To make things short, we enjoyed everything about our stay. We had a charming room with a queen and a single bed which is perfect for a couple and their child. The bathroom had a pretty nice size and was perfectly clean. The first thing we check in a room is the bathroom. You can say a lot about an establishement by looking at the bathroom and let me tell you that there was nothing bad to say about it. You could clearly see the cleaning lady took her work seriously. You fully deserved the tip we gave you... We also had one of those expensive quiet air-conditionning units on the wall, it was a welcomed addition. The parking was BIG. They have more space then they need, I couldn't beleive it. The breakfast was enjoyable, they have lots of choices so you can always pick-up something different every morning. My kid was always after those chocolate muffins.Did I mention that all of those are included in the rate they give you? I talked to the receptionist and he told me that they had budget, standard and deluxe rooms to choose from. So wether you're on a budget or not you'll always find something.I'll be coming back for sure. They told me the Just for Laughs festival is a couple of corners away. I think it will be worth it."
41,1419,"Jun 12 2005	Caution!!!!!!! Stay away from this hotel!	I stayed at this hotel for the weeekend of June 3-4, 2005. I don't think I will ever go back. The staff was rude. The room has cochroaches. The hotel has no AC during the day. Spend the extra money and stay away from this place."
42,1419,"Jun 5 2005	HORRIBLE AWFUL TERRIBLE!!!!!	DO NOT STAY HERE! There was cockroaches in the bathroom! It may be cheat and downtown but that is about it! The room was so small and smelly, once our luggage was down we couldn' move. The outside street was noisy and woke us up every night. Plus the front desk staff was rude and unfriendly. Take my advise spend the extra dollars and stay somewhere else."
43,1419,"Jan 24 2005	A nice quiet stay in downtown	I wanted to visit montreal with my wife in the beginning of January. The name of the place did catch my attention so I went on their website. It was a bit dated but I was able to easily make the reservation by e-mail. I went there by car and was a bit nervous when I saw that parking in downtown was almost non existent even for that time of year. How relieved was I when I got to the hotel and saw their parking. I mean, it is HUGE! They could probably build another hotel in there. Now on to the hotel itself. Well let me tell you, this place is absolutely charming. I was a bit worried because the rate they gave me seemed a bit low for a 3 stars hotel but I figured we were in the low season. I had nothing to worry about: the room was perfect! Nice queen size bed, nice bathroom and most of all, it's very clean. There's nothing like entering a hotel room and feel it has never been used before. It shows the respect the establishement has for its guests.I had a nice chat with the night receptionist while having a tea in the breakfast room. He told me they had deluxe, standard and budget rooms. I was in a standard room but for just $10 CAD more I could get an even more spacious room.The breakfast was a nice surprise too. Croissant, chocolate breads, bagels, cheese... it's only a fraction of what they offer and best of all, it's all you can eat! The breakfast room is a nice open area where you can have conversations with other friendly tourits (we met a nice couple from Vancouver).Overall I would recommend Hotel Manoir des Alpes to anybody who wants a satisfying and quiet stay. They recently installed wireless high speed internet so next time I go there, i'll bring my laptop."

2,1424,"Jul 7 2009 	One star is one too many	My husband and I were spending a couple of nights in Montreal and were just looking for a room to sleep in, nothing fancy. I was hoping just for a clean, simple room, in a relatively good location. Unfortunately, this hotel came nowhere near our low expectations. It was quite disgusting. The air conditioning in first room we were given wasn't working so they offered us another room, where the air conditioning did work, but it was very loud. The window looked onto a dark very small courtyard. The room was dirty (literally crumbs and garbage on the nightstand, hairs on the sheets). The bathroom was so small, that you had to stand sideways in the shower or else your shoulders would touch the wall and shower curtain (and I'm a small woman). The toilet area was so narrow there was no room for a toilet paper holder, so the roll was just placed on the back of the toilet tank. I didn't like to take my shoes off for fear of what might be on the carpet. We tried the fan once, but it shook so much I thought it was going to fly off the ceiling and land on the bed. We put the &quot;please clean the room&quot; sign on the room one day when leaving at 9AM and when we came back at 6:30 PM it hadn't been made up. So we asked the front desk and they gave us new towels, but that was it. The explanation was that they only had one housekeeper so they hadn't gotten to our room yet (at 6:30 PM!!).Overall the location was pretty good for what we wanted, but I would absolutely not stay there again. It came out to $80 a night, and wasn't worth half that."
3,1424,"Aug 31 2008 	So unbeilevably awful	So, we get there and they're like &quot;I'm sorry, the room you've booked (the one with two full sized beds) is too dirty, so we can't let you stay there&quot;. Things happen, we understand, but we assumed that we'd either A) receive an upgrade at no additional charge for our inconvenience or B) receive a downgrade but at a hefty discount. What happened is we received a downgrade to one full sized bed and a cot, they knocked $5 off the price. However, if we had booked the same room in advance, it would have been $20 cheaper. We were a little irked, but we were still willing to give the hotel a go.So, we get up to the room, which is fairly dirty but not any real horror, drop our stuff there and go out for the night. It's a bit of a walk to downtown Montreal, but it wasn't that bad. Come that night, me and my friend took off our clothes to put on pajamas and left our clothes in the bathroom. When we woke up the next morning, all our clothes were soaked. We don't know if the toilet ran or there was a leak or what, but it was disgusting. Would not ever stay there again, would never recommend to a friend, will avoid at all costs."
4,1424,"Aug 19 2008 	It takes two to tango: Filthy Room and Dishonest Management	The room so called Superior room is a crowded and dark, 10 years of haven't been vacuumed carpet room with a filthy bathroom (no word can accurately describe its actually condition).We booked 2 superior room and were given only one superior room with one so called standard room, which is much worse than the superior room. We decided that we should cancel that room and were promised the refund would be in the morning. WELL that never happened. The excuses were the manager wasn't there, and we called later the manager was on vacation. And, we finally get to him to only be confirmed that we will never get our refund back for that one room, whether we like it or not.So, no please do not put yourself, nor your loved ones into this kind of situation as I mistakenly did. Desperate or not, you are better off in your car or in an airport."
5,1424,"Apr 21 2008	Hotel of Horrors	Giving this place one star is being optimistic. From the moment I entered the hotel room, I knew my stay was not going to be easy. Upon first inspection, I noticed that the carpet was not vacuumed and the futon was covered in crumbs. Further inspection revealed a lampshade with blood on it, hair on the bedsheets, and a ceiling fan that wobbled so much that leaving it on would be a safety hazard. In the bathroom there wasn't any soap, and the toilet paper roll was almost empty. Also, when the shower was turned on, it would spray all over the bathroom. One of my roommates asked the front desk for more sheets, but they didn't have any. The only sheet she had to sleep on had a huge mysterious black stain on it. Also, there is no parking at this hotel, which is a huge hassle if you are unfamiliar with the city (and don't understand very much French). Needless to say, stay somewhere else. Spend the extra money and book at a higher quality hotel down the street. No one should have to sleep in a hotel room that looks like a CSI crime scene. Sure, this hotel is cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for!"
6,1424,"Mar 23 2008 	Nightmare On Park Avenue	This &quot;Hotel&quot; is probably the most atrocious place I have ever had the misfourtune of visiting, upon arrival there was an employee surfing Porn in plain open view of the public, then we were told we had reserved an &quot;Ecomony Room&quot; in the basement which we knew already but when we entered the room it was crawling with ants and absolutly filthy! when i complained the front desk clerk had to be convimced to move us to another room on the second floor which turned out to be just as bad as the first room ...minus the ants...the room was filthy and stained the shower was full of mold and som chunky substance which I gag when I think of...it was aproximatly 1 am and we didnt know what to do we were told this was the best they had ....after a sleepless night staring at a filthy room we checked out and had to argue to get our money back for the 2nd night which we were made to pay in advance and had no intention of staying the second night the manager was rude and argumentative and really didnt care about us or our situation ! After threatening to call the police we were begrugingly refunded for 1 night , I can honestly say this is the worst of the worst ...no parking and no concern for guests ...Stay away from this place and hopefully they will be forced to clean this place up or do the world a favor and advertise it as it is A DUMP!!!!!!!!!"
7,1424,"Sep 21 2007 	Terrible place to stay	We had initially booked a room at the Hotel Park Avenue for a few nights, through the hotel Website. We had selected the place due to its location - walking distance to our hospital. This was actually an expensive place to stay if you factor the remote parking that the hotel recommended to us (there is no hotel parking!). Staff was cordial but we discovered small and smelly hallways, no elevators and a 'standard room' which we found dirty, smelly, small, old, noisy - poor acoustic insulation; the bathroom especially was the size of a closet and terrible. After sleeping for only 1 or 2 hours during our first night there, we moved on to something better for the other nights. Someone please renovate or tear this place down soon. It is just not worth staying at the Hotel Park Avenue when you can stay at a 4-star hotel a few blocks away for just a few dollars more per night., and get a good night's sleep."
8,1424,"Sep 16 2007	Something out of the Twilight Zone!!	I have never in my life felt so uneasy as I entered a hotel in my life!!! Booking from Hotels.com has usally been easy, the hotels are genrally decent and you get what you pay for...not here!!!From the minute we pulled up in front of the hotel we new we were in an episode of the Twilight Zone! The buzzer entry should have given it away...the stentch as you walked into the building and up the 1970's style carpet stairway indicated to us that we had made a huge mistake!!!The receptionist, who incidently could look at both me and my fiance with each eye as they were facing totally opposite directions, met us at the top of the stairs yelling out; &quot;Are you the inspectors??&quot; (I think that is similar to asking if we were police investiators) while wolfing down his sandwich.He proceeded to change our reservation room from what he called a Supreme Suite, room 305, to some crappy off in the corner replacement, room 101, and told us room 305 was not clean yet, check in is at 2pm no??? What also should have indicated to us that we were not in the right spot was the well dressed foreign business man who came walking down the stairs wth a grin on his face...at 2pm I might add...We got our key, which was an actual key and not a card, and told the guy we wanted to check out the room he gave us first. Well, I think my bedroom at home is bigger and the bed was a super single right next to te entrance of the room...we did not have to look any further, we booked it out of there bfore you could say &quot;pass the salt&quot;!!!We called hotels.com and they were gracious enough to offer to cover the costs the hotel would charge us int he end..thank goodness...I wouldn't even send my worst enemy there!!"
9,1424,"Jun 5 2007 	1 star hotel? Hopeful!	My boyfriend and I made the mistake of staying here. The one star rating is rather hopeful; two-thirds of a star would be more like it.Apart from the fact that the front door's keycode never worked all weekend, the chair stuck &quot;Artfully&quot; in the hallway, the red paint on the power jacks, the thermostat hanging off of the wall, the suspicious stains in the bathroom, the sink in the main room with no pipes, and the pre-ripped towels, this is the perfect &quot;No frills&quot; experience for the weary traveler. The only positive - the beds were firm and the sheets, though smelling strongly of bleach, were clean.I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you're really, really, really, really, really desperate and have no where else to go."
10,1424,"Jan 16 2007	run away	other than the wires hanging from the sockets, the lamp that didn't light, a bathroom with the sink hanging over the toilet, and my ATM card that went missing there, this was a fine place."
11,1424,"Jun 15 2006 	adorable little hotel	This hotel impressed me very much. It's small, quiet, secure, clean and overall almost perfect.The personel was very polite and helpfull.Excellent for any kind of trip."
12,1424,"Sep 27 2005	overcharged three times!	I initially stayed at this hotel on account of the price, and was prepared to forgive the less-than-modern decor and services. However, I was eventually charged three times for my rooms, and am still having a hard time trying to recover the extra money charged to my credit card. CA$75 is a lot to charge for this kind of room already; CA$225 is outrageous."
13,1424,"Jan 11 2005 	Ideal for Students!	I stayed at the Hotel Parc Avenue for a whole month in July 2003 - I was to do a year of studying in Montral preceded by an Intensive French Language course which lasted a month. Unfortunately I booked the university residences too late but was offered this hotel by &quot;La Maison Internationale de Montreal&quot; who deal in accommodation mainly for students.Anyway, to cut to the chase...I found this hotel ideal - especially considering that I only paid about $30 CAD a night! The rooms were a decent size complete with a small refigerator and dish-washing type sink with overhead cupboards, a Combi Cable TV/Radio (bizarre I know!), a lounge type chair, a desk chair and desk and Air Conditioning. The bathroom was basic but clean, towels and face cloths were provided and changed every day.Downstairs on the same floor as reception there is a small but useful kitchen (no pans provided although there were cooking implements), ice machine and outdoor deck.Because of my long stay and because I booked through LAMIMO I had the use of the clothes washing facilities in the basement free of charge, all I had to do was bring my own powder and softner - Laundry could only be done in the evenings though because housekeeping used them during the day for the hotel linen.My only real problem was with the (obviously) antique A/C system - mine leaked all over the floor for some reason despite the temperature being set above the &quot;danger&quot; level for the AC system. I was then moved to another room.... with another AC that proceeded to do the same but not too bad thankfully!Right next to the hotel there is a Dairy Queen and McDonalds, over the road there is a service station with chips and the like but also an A&amp;W. 5 minutes down Mont-Royal one will find a Provigo supermarch, various cafs, an SAQ (Socit des Alcools de Qubec, the chain of government owned liquor stores)15 minutes away one will find the Mont-Royal Metro, however frequent buses for downtown leave from right outside the hotel.If you can put up with a one-star hotel then go for the Hotel Parc Avenue, you basically get what you pay for. I found the hotel well situated with basic facilities and a really attractive price!"
14,1424,"Sep 11 2004	Keep away from it !	By far the worst hotel of our week in Canada !Dirty room, dirty sheets, antique sanitation, smelly.And almost the most expensive of the week !Forget about it !!"
15,1424,"Jan 31 2004	Bad! Bad! Bad!	The Hotel looks very nice from the web-site, but that's about it. The room was very dirty, the bathroom had a urine smell, the bed and the TV looked like they were from the Salvation Army. I called a friend from their phone and she could bearly hera my voice, I had to shout really loud. It costed me $95 (Including Taxes ). The only good thing about this hotel was the door man. He was friendly and very helpful. He did not give me any problems when I ask him to return my money for the next two days I had booked it for. You can find much much much better hotels for the same price. Just keep looking and read other reviews. Good Luck"
16,1424,"Oct 27 2003	nightmare	The room was dirty, beds/clothing incredible, bathroom small, dirty, pipes leaking... The only advantage: near Mont Royal We were happy to leave this hotel in the early morning, still alive!"

18,1424,Aug 29 2008 	MUY MAL HOTEL
19,1424,Jul 23 2008 	Pas cher mais pas terrible
1,1435,Apr 10 2009 	Stole my house keys	This hotel now has my house keys and refuses to return them to me. I phoned numerous times and spoke to the Manager Jay Raaz and he told me he would send them and still no keys. I have no idea why they have an interest in keeping my house keys but DO NOT STAY HERE.
2,1435,"Jan 3 2009 	It Sucks!	The warped floors in this Motel are covered by the UGLIEST carpet you will EVER see. Bring your own towels, because if you take the &quot;weekly special&quot; this means they DON'T clean your room and you don't get a change of towels. But you WILL, however, save ten whole dollars! The staff is beyond rude, no customer service whatsoever. If you're looking to spend $80 a night to sleep in a slum just to downtown Montreal and find a rummy, give HIM $80 and borrow is cardboard box for the night.Find another inexpensive Motel, this one BITES the big one!HORRIBLE!"
3,1435,"Dec 17 2008 	dated basic	Was booked here by my host for a job interview, would not have been my choice.The motel was built probably in the 50s and it shows; there has been no significant upgrading or renovation since then.Pluses: motor court layout, each room has its own door and you can park right outside; convenient location for airport access and locations in Montreal West; quiet considering that it's on a major street and near train tracksMinuses: &quot;tired&quot; condition, mattress was thin and a bit lacking in support; no vent/fan in bathroom"
4,1435,"Sep 9 2008 	Putrid ... horrible .... beware	First time in my life (and I'm no youngster) that I checked out of a hotel shortly after checking in, without even staying the night. You want specific complaints? Lets start when you drive from the office to your room ... the road has more holes in it than swiss cheese. You get to the building where your room is ... a low, squat cement structure that looks like one of those buildings in Sarajevo or other war-torn regions, with crumbling cement falling off the outside walls and cracks throughout, as though shell-shocked (much as I felt, looking at all this). Ahhh, but the real splendor lies in the room .... a cement box, unadorned, two beds with headboards missing rails, stained carpets, stained everything, dirty grout (at least, one can only HOPE it was dirt, could have been mold, didn't want to get close enough to tell) throughout the shower walls, the general stench that permeated the place ... I'm giving this place a huge UGGHHH, no stars, stay away. We checked right out, was worth losing a nights rate as we got a decent room in a much better part of town. Oh yeah, the neighborhood leaves a lot to be desired as well, but no need to even get to that when you consider everything unpleasant about the place itself."
5,1435,"Mar 24 2008 	OK but...	For the price we were not expecting a lot, but we stayed at other hotels during our trip which were comparably priced and much nicer. The staff here were very polite and helpful, the problems were with the actual room. Cleanliness and appearance were lacking, and a great staff could not make up for that. The continental breakfast was the worst we had in a long time, 2 kinds of bread/toast, no fruit, 3 kinds of cereal, and that was pretty much it! We would not stay here again and recommend looking at other hotels in the area. One bright point, just up the street try out the Piccasso Restaurant, 24/7 and good food."
6,1435,"Mar 3 2008 	Meh	This motel seemed a little on the worse for wear side. The key cards didn't work in the lock so we had to run back to the front desk. The room was small and the beds were meh. There was a mini fridge and a microwave but the chairs for the table were really uncomfortable.The location is right off the highway, which is good if you're coming from a far distance. (we were driving from Charlottetown) If you are staying more than 1 day in Montreal and/or don't have a vehicle you will need to stay somewhere much closer to downtown.Parking is weird as well. You have to park in front of your room and since there was a huge pile of snow we had to park on an angle, in front of icy snow. This made getting luggage in and out a little tricky.I didn't go for breakfast, but my travel mates did and said there was only cereal and toast.It was an ok place to crash for one night but I wouldn't stay there a whole week."
1,1437,"Sep 20 2009 	Ok for 1 night or business traveller	We stayed here for 5 nights in all. The staff were very friendly and helpful but the room was quite depressing. We didn't look forward to going back to the hotel to relax, as the room was dingy so stayed out all day! Would recommend for 1 night though."
2,1437,Jan 12 2009 	Fine place to spend the night	Nice little hotel with friendly people. It was fine for a one night stay. We would stay there again. Convenient for shops and restaurants.
3,1437,"Jul 7 2008 	small but nice	small hotel with nice poeple,reasonable price.that's why we would like to recommend it."
4,1437,"Jul 2 2008 	Pretty average	I had to go to Montreal on very short notice, and with a very tight budget. I don't remember how much I paid exactly, but it wasn't a lot. The room was adequate for the night that I stayed there; however, it was very small. I find the pictures on the website to be a bit deceiving. The stone in the background is not real, though that is not a huge deal. The rooms are very cramped, and the bathroom is so tiny that when on the toilet, my knees touched the underside of the sink (and I have short legs!). It was also difficult to close the bathroom door, since I had to sit on the toilet sideways, so I was thankful I had the room to myself. The halls and stairways are also very narrow. The man at the front desk was nice though. It was night time when I arrived, and he told me where to go for food, and told me which areas to avoid. He also held on to my luggage the next morning after I had to check out before my ride showed up. I did not appreciate that he charged me for everytime I picked up the phone though (a few times, I picked up and hung up again without even dialing, and I was even charged for that! The charges for that were very unreasonable too, very expensive!) If I am in Montreal on a budget again, though, I would consider staying here again. I just wouldn't be using the phone!"
5,1437,Jul 2 2008 	very friendly and nice small hotel	nice small hotel with friendly front desk staff..........I would stay there again for sure.....
6,1437,Jul 2 2008 	BAD BAD BAD	This hotel is very well located but is always full of TEENAGERSBUS TOURS. My wife and I are over 50 years old and they put us in a room on a floor between one of those tour.We were the only ones out of the GANG.We COULD NOT SLEEP A SINGLE SECONDthat night due to the constant visit and door knock of our neighbors.They visited each other all night and we are sure they were doing d..I called the reception twice about the situation but without any results.We checked out early in the morning my wife being furious but the direction could not care less.NEVER NEVER AGAIN.What an awful night.Denysd2.
7,1437,Jun 25 2008 	nice comfortable hotel	I would say this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holiday and I am extremely fussy!
8,1437,"Jun 2 2008 	Bed Bugs - NOT worth it!	This place was terrible. Not only were the rooms dark and musty smelling, they also had bed bugs in the bed and and bathroom. We saw at least 2 or 3 crawling across our pillows when we settled down to watch TV and in the few hours that we had been there, two of them had found their way into our bags. We had only been there for 2 hours and decided to leave promptly after that. Unfortunately, we could not get our deposit back and they were not even going to refund us the money we had put down for the second night, but we brought front desk attendant up to the room and showed the boy all the bugs. Despite the fact we had to dish out another $100 for another room, we were very lucky that we did not bring a critter home with us. I would highly recommend AVOIDING this place. It's definitely not worth staying here to save a couple of dollars."
9,1437,"Nov 12 2007 	Good Value Great Innkeeper	Most of the time, reviews concern the room, amenities, etc. I'd like to give David the innkeeper kudos for being attentive to our needs...turned us on to some nice walking areas and even arranged for a car rental during Thanksgiving Weekend. The room was basic (we liked the openable door to get fresh air from outside) but clean, a block from Metro, and 20 minute walk from Vieux Montreal. Nice lounge for reading the paper and enjoying a croissant &amp; coffee in the mornings. For under $90/day including tax, this is a good value and we'll be back."
10,1437,"Oct 31 2007 	Simply Awful!	I will not recommend this hotel to anyone! The room was incredibly small, as soon as the worker had my money he was unbelieveably rude. In the hotel room there was a box of rotting egg salad sandwiches left on top of the air conditioner unit on the window. When the worker (owner?) was told about this, he became very rude and thought I was trying to scam him, until he came back to the room with me and saw I was telling the truth. HE DID NOT REMOVE THEM, instead he slammed the door shut and locked it. He told me he would give me another hotel room and refund my first night only. I advised him I would like a full refund and would find another hotel, he became angry and extermely rude and told me not to write a bad review of the hotel. The hotel was a dump. Even the sign outside the front was broken! I truly do not recommend this hotel! There is a much better hotel and not expensive just up the street!"
11,1437,"Oct 18 2007 	tight squeeze	Very cramped, double bed up against outer wall, accessible only from one side. Air Conditioner set in window at foot of bed, not properly sealed in window result an uncrontrollable cold blast of air over the bed all night through the gaps.Toilet and shower in one unit so cramped that a slightly obese person could not possibly get in or manouvre around. Not soundproof, every move overhead audible.We had just come from the Econolodge in Plattsburgh which was, by comparison, a paradise !There must be better places than this in Montreal !Couldn't take any photos for you, didn't have a close-up lens."
12,1437,May 22 2007	La Residence du Voyageur Boutique Hotel on Sherbrooke Street Montreal	On a recent visit to Montreal...I picked this small boutique hotel especially for the rate...I would not under any circumstances give this hotel any kind of a rating. Very small...and we had the largest room...walls paper thin...bedbugs...1/2 bathtub...dirty mattresses...windows that don't open and no air conditioning. Behind the bed it looked as though it has not been vacuumed ever. We were prepared to stay as it was just a place to put our heads down after being out most of the day...but...when the bedbugs appeared that did it!!. Not even worth the $117.00 we paid for it. We immediately left the next morning...6:30 am and went up to the Doubletree Hilton only a block and a 1/2 away. They were very accommodating and they gave us a great room for just a little more than at the Residence Du Voyageur. I would not under any circumstances recommend this hotel until they have cleaned up their act.
13,1437,"Mar 3 2006	People are too picky!!!	This hotel was fine. people are too snoody when it comes to traveling...hey your paying 80 dollars a night, you are not going to get the ritz!!! i enjoyed myself at this hotel, and it did the trick, i had a place to sleep on my vacation. this place is not bad, it has a great breakfast (i did not have it but it was offered) and it was clean and i had no complaints! i further recommend it for travelers who can handle being travellers if you want something extravagant than pay 100 dollars more...also its close to everything...walking distance!"
14,1437,"Dec 3 2005	Good stay if you get one of the big rooms	The first night i stayed there i was in the smallest room i've ever seen, i know the place is cheap and you get what you are paying for but this was extreme, you get a room with a poor New York apartment view like in the movies, mine was to a top roof and &quot;lovely&quot; air conditioner machines, i was not able to open the drawer all the way because the bed was there, i was surprise that the bathroom door could open entirely but in a moment i wonder if i was be able to seat on the toilet (thank God i could), the shower is 2x2 FEET and i'm not kidding or if you like it in another way it's 3 medium tiles per 3 medium tiles, paper thin walls? yes, you dont control at all the air conditioner so if it's your first night in -40 degrees farenheit (i saw it on TV) you are gonna have problems sleepingNext morning i went to the reception desk to ask to turn on the heat, the owner (a funny asian man) told me &quot;no problem, no problem -40 degrees just last night, not again&quot; so that sounded to me like they were not going to heat it up, after asking me were i was from for my surprise his wife was also mexican and because i was going to stay for a week he gave me an room upgrade for the same price (most of the people stay just 2 or 3 days)The new room was TOTALLY different, nice view, plenty space for 2 persons, the 2x2 shower was also there but i was so happy that i didnt care so the rest of my stay was perfect, i was leaving in the morning to see the city and coming back at night to sleep (wich i guess would not be possible in one of the tiny rooms)Continental breakfast like the other people said is cookies, croissants, coffee and orange juice (not natural)I stayed during low season so i paid 38 american dollars per night wich was not bad at all, i paid untill i was leaving and not at the beginning and for me it was very clean (probably because there was not too many people when i was there)Bottom line, if you dont fight for one of the 6-8 big rooms from the 28 they have you better go someplace else because you wont be able to rest and enjoy your vacations"
15,1437,Jul 18 2005	No Problems with this hotel for me	Sure this is not The Ritz but it's adequate enough for the $85 CAN/nite for a Thurs and Fri stay. I stayed at peek season(3rd time) and I'd go back. I had none of the problems people had in the other reviews. No check in problems and no noise. Staff was polite and more than ready to help with directions and needed ice trays.Breakfast (continental) was included and was set up to our liking.We were served croissants with jam(as much as we wanted) along with the cookie assortment and juice tea and coffee Sure the bathroom doorway was small for me and the tub was also but we were given a 2 double bed room which otherwise was good enough for us(especially for the price compared to other hotels in the area). Also was clean and cool enough with a great street and city view out front. If you are going to just stay and lounge in a hotel for your Montreal stay and expect to be waited on hand and food or you are on your honeymoon don't stay here. But we go to Montreal to do things away from the hotel and did't regret buying gifts to take home for the money we saved on the hotel stay. Another plus-the local hotel workers went on strike in the big hotels around us and guess who did't have to make up their own bed and clean there own room while the$150 to $200+ a night crowd were left to fend for themselves!
16,1437,"Jul 11 2005	Brutal	I just submitted the same review with the wrong city. This Hotel is located in Montreal, NOT Quebec city.Upon our arrival we were told that WE had made a booking error and all they had available was this horrible little room for the same rate as the normal room I had booked. It was obvious that the error was theirs, though they would not admit it. They were very, very unprofessional and made some inappropriate insinuations. Fortunately we were able to find another room elsewhere but not after having a very unpleasant exchange with the clerk. We spoke with some people who ended up staying in that little room who expressed the same opinion. They were also looking elsewhere for the next night."
17,1437,"Oct 30 2004	Not what I expected	From their website it looks like a decent place but when you get there you can see how they twist some of the words to make it sound better.The free parking is on the street, this wouldn't bother me much if I wasn't driving but if you're driving or renting a car be wary. My car got broken into on the street and it's a residental street! The rooms are a bit small and the bathroom is even smaller. In the morning, the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; is cookies, juice and coffee. You need to decide whether the price is worth it."
18,1437,"Jul 8 2004	Needs upgrading full of students!	We'd stayed here in the past and liked it ok (good location near Sherbrooke metro, cheap, adequate breakfast, quiet enough, clean enough), but recently found it unbearable. Halls look filthy, walls are paper-thin which don't block out the 3am drunken students, rooms are not the cleanest either. If you can bear minimum amenities, you might be able to stand it--we can't take the student ghetto its become any more!"
19,1437,"Mar 29 2004	Pleasant and Convenient	I had a great weekend stay in Montreal. It was affordable, the staff were friendly and very helpful, the room was quite comfortable with a nice view, and I was very close to the shopping, restaurants, and shows. I'd go back."
20,1437,"Nov 5 2003	Good for a budget hotel	This hotel isn't a 5 star hotel, and doesn't pretend to be. So, for $77 CDN (taxes included), you get what you pay for. However, for a budget hotel in a great location - it was perfect. The rooms were nice and clean, and despite the other reviews I found the staff to be very helpful. If your plan is to only sleep there and not have a romantic weekend - this is the hotel for you."
21,1437,"Oct 28 2003	Awful...simply awful	I had the misfortune of staying at this hotel back in April of 2003. Despite the relatively convenient location, the entire two night experience was a bust. Tiny rooms, paper thin walls, the squeakiest floors imaginable - resembled a Cold War holding cell. Staff showed little concern when complaints were made. In fact, I called a friend the final night to help me vacate 12 hours early. All this for nearly $70 US a night. Handy Tip - try the property across the street, same price, far more charming."
22,1437,"Sep 29 2003	Not Too Bad After Getting an Upgrade	I was planning a weekend getaway to Montreal. Wanted a good deal and a decent room close to everything. I made my reservation BEFORE checking the reviews. By the time I did, it was too late to cancel. The place is located VERY WELL for downtown and The Village. I did not find it to be the Hell-hole mentioned in another review. Tacky and a bit run-down? Yes. The staff was very helpful to me. Be Careful... there are different kinds of rooms. The hotel policy is to charge you UP-FRONT for your entire stay at the point of check-in. I refused until I saw the room. They didn't like this. The first room they showed me was despicable.... it was SO SMALL and dingy (this was the hell-hole mentioned). When I said, &quot;No, this won't do,&quot; they started to give me a whole diatribe about &quot;Being full (They weren't).... and it's so last-minute.&quot; When I refused to sign for the rest of the reservation, they showed me a different room, with two double beds.... THIS ONE WAS ACTUALLY NICE. Clean, decent space and GREAT SHOWER! They insisted on 10 Canadian dollars more per night. I insisited that the reputation on the internet was not a good one and that they should make good on promises. We split the difference. I ended up paying 65 Canadian Dollars per night (about US$48-50). Had a great room (LOOK FOR TWO DOUBLE BEDS-- not a &quot;double&quot; with only one bed), great location and a WONDERFUL TIME in Montreal. What a great city! You get what you fight for, in this situation. There ARE some decent rooms in the hotel-- but I snuck a peek while the made was cleaning--- NOT MANY! &quot;Breakfast&quot; was an urn of coffee and cookies near the entrance. If you sat in the crowded and ugly &quot;breakfast nook,&quot; you were served two stale-ish croissants per person. Plenty of hot water. Good, forceful shower. Would I go back? Not likely. But, this time, all worked out."
23,1437,"Sep 4 2003	what a nightmare!	This is the worst place I have ever been to! A hell hole would be more accurate. A big lie that didn't come cheap: $75 USD per night bought you a dinky little room with a slanted floor, a broken mattress and a view on the garbage dumpsters. The corridors were foul smelling, the decoration concisted of a disgusting looking fish pond and a pile of rusted garbage right in front of the entrance of the hotel. And just as all these amenities weren't enough the staff was inexistent and ill-mannered. What really made the experience unforgettable for me was the waitress spraying amoniac based windex on the surrounding tables as I was trying to choke down there subminiature breakfast. And a final note on the free parking feature: you get to drive around until you find your own free parking spot! Needless to say that I was very disappointed and regret that I was mislead by some guides that were recommending this place as a decent hotel."
24,1437,"Aug 16 2003	Cheap but Cheerless	If you're looking for old-world charm, pleasant Quebecois hospitality and a stress-free stay, this is not the hotel for you. The staff seemed hell-bent on redefining the words 'surly,' 'indifferent,' and 'ill-mannered.' An otherwise adequate experience was ruined by several early-morning calls from the front desk demanding that we move rooms to make way for other &quot;preferred&quot; guests. After clambering out of bed, and making it downstairs, we were given short-shrift by two charmless young ladies who gave us the keys to a second room, several floors down. Although exactly the same size, the new room reeked of stale cigarette smoke and was poorly lit. Only after 20 minutes of back and forth deliberation were we smugly told that we could have our original room after all. On the positive side, this hotel is centrally located, quiet and cheap (Note: you do get what you pay for -- spartan conditions, &quot;charming&quot; staff and a &quot;light&quot; continental breakfast -- (cookies and coffee))."

26,1437,Oct 17 2008 	convenable mais quelques problemes
1,1439,"Nov 2 2009 	this is a good hotel	I have stayed at this hotel for 3 times and had no problems. i travel to Montreal by train/bus and it is close to both sttion.The staff is very helpful.The hotel is old and decor is old but when you pay peanuts for a good location why do you compalin.I never saw bed bugs or experienced bad service from the staff.I would say you get a suite, most people never experience a suite hotel for the price lower your standards this aint the top of the line hotel have fun"
2,1439,"Oct 29 2009 	Disgusting hotel coupled with horrible service.	First, when we arrived the desk clerk was fast asleep in the office. Granted, it was around midnight, but it's still not the type of behaviour one expects from hotel staff. We had to ring the bell several times in order to wake him. Secondly, our reservation which had been booked through Orbitz was not in their system. After over 10 minutes of talking about it, I finally convinced him to phone Orbitz. He would not ask the appropriate questions to the Orbitz representative. He was trying to convince me to pay him directly even though I had already prepaid Orbitz. After growing frustrated with him, I phone Orbitz on my cell phone and was able to resolve the issue and the representative faxed him the appropriate documents. This process took nearly an hour.In the interest of keeping this short, the room was horrible with cigarette burns on the carpet and stains in various places, including the furniture. Avoid this place like the plague."
3,1439,"Oct 5 2009 	Disgustingly unsanitary a health hazard with misleading website! Stay Away!	I have been travelling over twenty years for business and I have never been compelled nor had any issues with a hotel serious enough to write a review until now. I truly regret relying on this hotels website pictures, (which make their rooms look like a decent place to stay at a good rate), and for not taking the time to find out more before I booked it for a business trip. However I have done this many times in the past without any issues, but my luck more than ran out with this one and it turned out to be a very big mistake! I can now see we werent the only guests who were in utter shock at the condition of the room we were given! To begin, we booked on-line for a 3 night stay using the hotels website where we requested a queen size bed because the booking process did not make it clear what we were getting. A confirmation email was sent to me confirming a queen size bed was in fact what we would get. Our nightmare begins while checking in we were told that parking is $18.75 per day (no surprise at cost), however parking is off site and a very inconvenient 4 minute walk down the street around the corner in an outside parking lot, as others guests have mentioned, but I should add it is also unsupervised at night. Big rip-off because the cost for onsite underground&quot; parking at most hotels is usually $20. The clerk then took a $350 authorization on my credit card (hotel procedure she claims) so not a big deal at this point, however you will find out the real reason as you read further on! We then went up to our room and opened the door to what looked like a room you would see in the slums of any North American city. Certainly not a Hotel in Canada and Im not exaggerating here! The room had an awful musty, but peculiar odour which we would later figure out. The carpet looked like it was not vacumed and had stains through-out; the bathroom had cracks in the ceiling and walls, and black mold on the tub &amp; tile sealer that was just smeared on thick and erratically and a tub that was stained yellow because it looked like it had not been properly cleaned for years! On to the bedroom surprise!!...The walls were awfully marked-up and looked like they had not been painted for years, more black mold on the window sills, and what was supposed to be a queen size bed turned out to be a double bed that was extremely hard, and the peculiar odour was noticeably more intense in here. I called the front desk and complained, however she did not offer any help whatsoever. At this point we went downstairs and told the clerk we would be leaving the hotel based on the unsanitary condition of our room and their misleading website. However we were told if we left we would still be charged for the night, but could leave in the morning. We asked to speak to a manager, but were told she was not available at the time. Now we know why the $350 authorization on my credit card. If we had left they already had the credit card authorization and therefore had the ability to charge us for our entire 3 night stay, so we were then forced to stay the night. This turned out to be a bad decision because in the middle of the night my wife had an asthma attack triggered from the peculiar odour and both of us developed severe headaches. This may sound odd, but something clicked and it only then dawned on us that what we smell was pesticide! In the morning we packed up and went down stairs to check out. We complained to who was now the new clerk and while we were complaining we had an opportunity to speak to the manager as she walked out. The manager confirmed the smell was in fact from pesticide but the room was sprayed 3 weeks ago and that is usually enough time for the smell to go away. She believed our complaints and asked us to wait while she went to up our room to take a look. When she came back down she agreed the room was terrible and gave us a 30% discount and a free night stay at a future date. However, I would NOT stay in this hotel ever again even if its free! I would not have known why the pesticide was sprayed if not for the pictures of the guest showing the actual bed bugs and the bites from them!!! I urge other travelers to stay away from this hotel! The rooms are filthy and unsanitary and if the black mold and bed bugs isnt enough to make you sick, the pesticide they use to kill them sure will! I would also like to mention that there are many many other hotels that are in the same convenient proximity to downtown Montreal and its certainly worth paying a little extra at a reputable hotel or even a lesser known hotel, but one which has better reviews. This dump is NOT worth the money and is a health risk which should not be used as a hotel for travelers to this great city. As a business professional who has been travelling for over 20 years, in my humble opinion, I can honestly say it is unjust to rate this hotel with even one star."
4,1439,"Sep 25 2009 	There are better options	My wife and I had stayed at this hotel about 5 years ago on at least two occasions. Both times were pleasure trips, and besides having somewhat old furnishings, the hotel suited us fine.Now in September of 2009, things have changed, and not for the better. I read through about 35 reviews to see if my experience was consistent with the majority of the other guests, and I can say that, unfortunately, yes it was.So lets start with the booking process. There is a web site, but it seemed too amateur, e.g. missing pages in English to enter credit card details. So I booked over the phone, which went well. I booked for five nights - Sunday to Friday - as part of my business trip. The location is perfect when arriving on the train as it is literally only a 5 minute walk - even with luggage in tow.Upon arrival, the check-in process was un-eventful. I remember the elevators being old and sketchy from my earlier visits and that had not changed. Since I took the train, I did not require parking, but if I did, it would have been two blocks away at $18,63 as other reviewers had indicated. Apparently the garage is closed for repairs. The pool and sauna were both closed. The exercise room had three old pieces of equipment and no treadmill (standard issue for any hotel promoting their fitness centre). High speed Internet was free and worked quite well.I was located on the 10th floor in a &quot;studio&quot; suite. The room was facing the back of the hotel, so I had a decent view of the new Congress Centre, the River and of course the Honda dealership. But it was quiet - at least on the outside.My kitchen had the new faux-maple cabinets, new countertop, new sink and new ceramic floor tiles. Quite nice actually. The stove was from the 70's, but it, including the oven worked fine. The fridge was also from the 70's. It worked, but was very noisy. It would run for 5 minutes then turn off for 6 minutes and then run for 5 minutes, over and over. It was very loud, so if you were a light sleeper, you would want to unplug it at night. The new sink did not have a stopper, but I did manage to get one after asking three times. There were two knives, two forks, two spoons, two plates, two bowls, two drinking glasses, two wine glasses, two coffee cups, a cork screw, a can opener and one steak knife. There was one large and small pot, one frying pan, a collander, a toaster (it worked), a kettle (it worked) and a two-cup coffee maker (it seemed to be broken) and a newish microwave (worked fine). There were no cooking pans.e.g. pizza sheet for the oven, so I improvised and used the large pot (I removed the handle first of course). There were no cooking utensils, save for a large spoon (for can soup I presume), no mixing bowls, nothing like that. There was one wash cloth, one drying cloth, one scouring pad, dish soap and a dish rack and tray. This was a kitchen for re-heating food, not creating culinary masterpieces. As is my standard practice at hotels, I was sure to put my trash in the trash receptacle in the lobby each night to avoid attracting bugs.The bathroom was ok. The shower was ok and I did not experience any of the hot/cold fluxuations that others did. The toilet paper holder was busted off when I arrived, but was fixed on the first day when I reported it. The bathroom was fairly clean, but I did find a few long black hairs - I can deal with that as they were probably from the cleaner. Fortunately, there were none of the short curly variety. The linens were fine, but at least one towel and the floor mat had holes. The floor tiles were nice and seemed new. The fan worked fine, but was very loud - typical of almost all hotels these days.The living area/bedroom were the part of the suite that made the experience so regrettable. The dark blue carpet was HEAVILY stained. There were many large brown stains (like coffee), white stains, dirt stains from shoes/boots, black marks from who-knows-what - all kinds of stains. The windows were dirty. The window sills were dirty. There were spider webs on the outside and one night I encountered a huge spider (on the outside). As there were no screens, I quickly closed the window so it did not come in. Why were the windows open? Well it was mid-September, so the weather was still fairly warm. The A/C was not very effective and also very loud (and right next to the bed, so once again, not great for light sleepers). If it was set to 20 it would run forever with moderately cool air. If it was set to 25 to turn off the cool air (there was no on/off), it would start circulating warm air. You could not win - either hot air or cold air - no happy medium. So I had the windows open to cool the room off, plus bring in some fresh air. Hotels here are non-smoking now, but the air was still kind of stale from all those years of having smokers. One of the blinds was partially broken, but with a document clip that I always travel with, I was able to keep it shut to keep the light out. (I reported it, but it was not fixed.) The table and two chairs were fine, in the context of the room. There was one occasional chair that seemed ok, and a dresser and mirror. I too noticed that a lot of the electrical receptacles were so old that the plug was loose and would sometimes fall out. I did my ironing. The iron was basic, but worked pretty well. The ironing board was average. The TV was a vintage 20&quot; tube (CRT) and was located on a coffee table at the foot of the bed. The TV remote control was new and worked fine.Next, on to the bed and linens. The bed (mattress and box spring) was of average quality and seemed new. I checked for bugs upon arrival as I felt that, based on the conditiona of the carpet, it was a possibility that there would be bugs (I had not read the reviews in advance). However, thankfully, I did not see evidence of any bugs during my stay. The quality of the sheets and pillows was poor. They sheets were worn thin and the pillows were small, old and lumpy. The bed had one of those 70's bedspreads as others have stated. It seemed typical for a place like this. There were no stains.Finally, there was the checkout. I checked out early Friday morning and the attendant was cheerfull and efficient.The hotel is in a great location - close to the financial district, close to the Metro stations, close to the Train station, close to shopping and nightlife - but sadly the experience was so unenjoyable, I would recommend, as have others, to spend the extra money and stay elsewhere."
5,1439,"Sep 10 2009	Unpretentious excellent value for the money	I initially hesitated to book this hotel based on some bad reviews I read. But then I noticed most of the negative reviews from from 2008 and most complained about bed bugs. However seeing responses from the hotel management allayed my fears enough to give this place a try--and I came away pleasantly surprised! The room was spacious, unpretentious, and very clean (except maybe the carpet). The location is ultra convenient--right in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of McGill University where I was delivering my daughter. The small but tidy kitchen was a nice touch, as was the bistro-like seating for two in the eating area. The two minor issues I encountered (burned out light bulb and missing bath towels) were corrected on the spot by the front desk. And the price! I was saying to my wife that I haven't paid this little ($79) for a hotel room since staying at the Penny Sleeper Inn 21 years ago at Disneyland! So what are the negatives? Well, there are many signs that you are indeed staying in a budget hotel: there was no coffee or tea bags in the room, despite the presence of a coffee machine. The TV looked like it was from the '80s--an old 24&quot; tube model with maybe a dozen channels--all of them fuzzy. The windows bore obvious signs of condensation damage. The air conditioner was loud (but effective during the heat wave). And the aforementioned carpet--I was hesitant to take off my shoes even. But like I tell people--what do you expect for a sub $100 room--in the middle of downtown in a major city? And for 79 bucks, this was an absolute steal. I will definitely return the next time we're in Montreal to visit our daughter. One final thing: I've been back over two weeks now and no sign of bed bug bites. That's the best sign yet."
6,1439,"Sep 7 2009 	What a dump!	We only stayed 2 nights here and that's 2 nights too many!!! The room was not cleaned well if at all after the previous guest. Found lots of hair in the bed and in the bathroom. However, to my request clean sheets were provided straight away. All the furniture is very old and worn and in dire need of replacement and the whole building could do with a total revamp! The bathroom looked hideous as the wall tiles were held on by some ridiculous amount of silicon(sealant) which looked like a pile of s***All in all, if you want to save yourself the headache then pay a bit extra and stay somewhere else."
7,1439,Aug 24 2009 	excellent price	Excellent quality - price hotel. great location and spacious room.The staff was friendly and the room was clean.I was happy with my stay at this hotel.
8,1439,"Aug 23 2009 	Bed Bugs Bed bugs bed bugs	My wife and I booked a night at this hotel at the last minute thinking the price was reasonable and the location good. We were not going to be spending a ton of time in the hotel, just one night of sleep. The room we were given was awful looking. We did not like the look of the room, but we checked in at 12:30am, and we were planning on getting up early anyways, so we said to ourselves not a big deal. What a mistake! While the mattress did look old, we looked to make sure the was no bugs in the bed before going to sleep. I had never encountered bed bugs before in my life, but when my wife got up to go the washroom, she came back and woke me up to tell me that there were bugs in the bed, and lo and behold there they were. As it was about 4:30am, we just wanted to get out of the hotel as soon as possible as were disgusted. I asked for a full refund, and the man at the desk said he could not give me one as we would not authorized to give one. He said because he offered us another room, that he could not give a refund. Like we were going to stay there! He told me to call his supervisor Madame Smith the next day to ask her. I did and she offered to provide me with a 25% discount on our next stay back in the hotel! Stayed at this hotel on a Thursday...skip ahead to Monday when I start to itch in certain parts of my body. Don't think much of it, as I did not know anything about bed bugs. As every day goes by, it keeps getting worse and worse, and as you can see by the photos the bites on my body hit a peak almost a week later. The phyical, but most importantly mental pain that I have endured are indescribable. Please for your own health and those around you do not stay at this hotel. Pay an extra $50 for a hotel that has a better name. Its simply not worth the pain and suffering you will experience."
9,1439,"Aug 1 2009 	Very VERY disappointing..	We booked this hotel through hotwire thinking that having a kitchen would be convenient. When I called to check on my reservation only to have someone rudely tell me they don't have time to check and hang up!!It was more that disappointing when we showed up. It was dirty from the fingerprinted windows to the sad paint that was scratched in the bedroom. There was only a tiny tv to watch in the living room area on a couch that couldn't be sat on(I used a chair) The shower blasted hot to cold! Unfortunately, as soon as we showed up the swimming pool and saunas were out of order.We felt like we could only be there to shower and sleep..no way was it a place to relax which made it rather uncomfortable.The telephone in the room was broken so you could not hear the person on the other end. Also, the internet access in the lobby was a sad joke, paying 2 $ for it just to get to one site since it's SO old doesn't cut it.I now know to skip the kitchenette and pay a bit more through hotwire to get a better hotel.I would NEVER stay there again or recommend it to anyone.what a Dive!!!"
10,1439,Jul 31 2009 	Stay Away!!!!	I was so dirty we don't event stay their for night.we also never get our money back
11,1439,"Jul 24 2009 	HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! No Facecloths??????	OK so my friend and I are currently staying at this hotel.. we have been here for two nights so far and are terribly disappointed. The service at the front desk is terrible.. the people are rude!! When we asked where the pool and fitness center were located the guy laughed at us and told us it was on the pent house level... ! We went up there to discover a creepy floor that was empty and full of cob webs. We went up in bathing suits and the pool was drained and closed! we then proceeded to the femal &quot;workout area&quot; where we found 3 of the oldest pieces of dysfunctional gym equiptment imaginable. The sauna and shower area are like something from a horror movie.On our first day here we didnt have any facecloths in our room... so we used the small towels that were in the bathroom... on the second day we called down to get facecloths since there still werent any and they made it seem like this was a chore, but they sent 2 up to the room, and the lady who delivered them winked at us and said &quot;its ok&quot;.. whats ok?? i payed for this room I want to wash my face!!. Today while we were gone the cleaners took our 2 facecloths and 2 little towels and left us with 1 facecloth!!! 1?? there are 2 of us here!!! So we called the front desk and they said &quot;sorry we dont have any facecloths&quot;... that doesnt make any sense because we have one!! grrrr we are so mad. Our coffee maker in the kitchen doesnt work and the couch is too scary to sit on. I dont want to get a skin disease. I am lucky to be able to write this review because our &quot;free&quot; internet only works 2% of the time!!!! oh and everything is in french so we cant understand any of the tour guides!Anyways moral of this story... the local is prime!! but not worth the hassle.. we need to stay one extra night but it will not be here!!"
12,1439,"Jul 24 2009 	Never Again!!! Awfull place Dirty Dangerous a real bad experience...	I started my reservationn by phone and I have asked to receive my confimation via e-mail so that I would have physical proof of the transaction. So the lady that took my booking hardly even spoke english or french and did not write the informations properly. A day later I call back to see if I had received the e-mail confirmation and their was nothing ... I call back and ask to get it again sent to my e-mail, the lady on the phone tells me that the do not have an e-mail adress at all with my reservation.. So I give it to them again and they managed to confirm the wrong informations. So I get there and they sign me in and I got up to my room wich is suppossed to be the large suite. I get in there and the place was discusting, bugs on the ground, flies, brown streaking on the walls, no screen for the wondows (from the 15th floor!) , the coffee table was broken, the sofa bed was broken, the appliances where older then my husband and I... We actually took our luguage and asked for a refund because it's completely innaceptable. They only refunded my 2nd nights stay but I had been there for less then 30 min not mentionning their parking being 2-3 blocks away. Then they wanted to kick us out for asking the full refund. They even told me that they know that the room they game me was a pretty bad one. So after wasting 4 hours I have lost my time and over 100$... NERVER EVER going there again!!"
13,1439,"Jul 14 2009 	STAY AWAY	When I read the comments on this website before booking this hotel, I thought it couldn't be so terrible, but it definately is. Here's why :1. There were hairs in the bed and on pillows;2. The bathtub was filthy;3. The windows were covered with fingerprints;4. The carpet was stained;5. It looked like the room wasn't cleaned in a while.6. Expensive outside parking (the hotel said they have an agreement with Safeway parking and charged us 18,63 $ for the space while, at the parking lot, they say the maximum daily rate is 10,00 $...)So, even if this hotel isn't expensive, it's worth spending a few extra bucks to get a decent room in a decent hotel."
14,1439,"Jun 8 2009 	DO NOT STAY HERE.	Yes, this hotel is in a good location, but even with its cheap price tag, I would argue you would rather pay that NOT to stay in this hotel. All the reviews about bed bugs are right (we bought sheets our first nights to cover what was there). Black hairs ARE found... in the bed... in the kitchen... in the microwave. White hairs found on the carpets. STAINS everywhere. COB WEBS everywhere. The tub did not look like it had been cleaned in 10 years. The walls had grease stains. The bathroom door had urine stains. The tub and sink were chipped. Everyone else complained about water temperature in the bathroom, we had ZERO water pressure... as in to the extent that it took half an hour to rinse out my husband's almost shaved short hair. Our neighbours tried to murder the other, by throwing one out the window. The Sri Lanka protestors are directly infront of our windows. Some continuous beeping of the fire alarm kept us up at night. Make up stains on everything. Cigarette burns EVERYWHERE and on ANYTHING. I did not check out of this hotel, but I did ask for an apology, which I still have no received. I have written a formal letter of complaint, with still no apology. I hope this hotel will lose its stars, so that nobody else will be tricked in staying in this death trap. They also claimed we would have free internet access, which actually ending up being incredibly expensive.DO NOT STAY HERE. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THE CHEAP PRICE IS NOT WORTH IT...you will want to pay anything just to get the heck out of there."
15,1439,"Apr 8 2009 	BED BUGS....DISGUSTNG!!!	We stayed at this hotel for a girls weekend and since we are in university we thought that it would fit our budget of only $89 a night. We read the reviews on expeida but i wish that we had read these reviews. When we got to the hotel we were treated kind of rudely by the staff but oh well, we got to our hotel room and it smelled bad so we called them and they said that they would call us back (they never did). There was a huge slash in one of our walls like someone was murdered there. We then took a shower in which the water would go from cold to scalding hot. We went out to the bar and came back only to chat some more in bed, it was then we found bed bugs...we saw at least 10 in our 2 beds and called the from desk to complain. The girl was pretty nice but we told her we were leaving and did nto expect to pay. We then drove to the closest hotel (stil drunk) and checked in at the shereton for $200 a night in which we had the best treatment and experience of our life...We called the hotel after our visit to complain to the manager about the bed bugs and she called us liars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! never ever stay here... Just because you dont see bed bugs when you check in does not mean they are not there! They only come out just before dawn to feed and bites can take up to 10 days to appear. Not worth the trauma of constantly feeling itchy and like you have been bitten, not to mention all the crap i through out just incase we took the bed bugs home."
16,1439,"Mar 27 2009 	Disgusting Despicable Disappointing!!!	Okay folks heres the deal - this hotel.. demonstrates the three major D's on the DONT list when looking for a hotel.Lets start with Disgusting: the hotel was very unsanitary, with black hair, stained carpets, and bed bugs.Secondly, the customer service was despicable- no compassion for people trapped in broken elevators with exposed electrical wires from the lights hanging out of the ceilings. Finally, this hotel was mostly and unfortunatly disappointing. Being fans of bagels bites, we decided that after a long night of partying, a few bagel bites would be the perfect snack. However when it came to cooking the bagel bites there was a slight dilema; there was no baking sheet to place the bagel bites on so we had to settle with using the microwave (meaning the bagel bits would not be as satisfying because of their soggy texture). Unfortunatly as we quickly discovered, the microwave didnt work and the hight setting on the microwave was equivalent to the low setting on the microwave. If thats not bad enough, the showers would change from freezing cold to burning hot in the matter of seconds. There was no happy medium.This hotels three-star rating should really be re-considered. Perhaps a 1 star would be more appropriate."
17,1439,"Mar 23 2009 	Terrible!	We arrived at LaTour with high hopes, as we had heard it was a great location and we got an excellent price on the room. It definatly would have been worth it to spend a little more money to stay elsewhere. We arrived in the room and there were long black hairs in our bed, in our kitchen, in the fridge, and tons in the bathroom. Being students we could handel that, but because we ARE students we seemed to get the absolute worst customer service imaginable. We got trapped in the elevator and it started to bounce between floors and plummet. This happened 3 times! Each time we called the front desk to get laughed at. We did not feel safe at ALL.To top off the trip we ended up making our bus by 2 minutes because they &quot;forgot&quot; to give us a wake up call. When the conserige felt our wrath, he took his sweet time checking us out of the hotel. DO NOT STAY HERE."
18,1439,"Mar 20 2009 	An alright Economy Hotel	Stayed 3/09. For $89 a night, it was a good deal, but not without its drawbacks. The elevators are very sketchy at best, so a 17 floor hotel can be quite a trip up an down the stairs when they break down. Hotel staff is slow, with our check in taking close to half an hour. The parking garage is closed, so you have to pay to park across the street in an open lot. Did not have a problem with bed bugs though. And at only a block from Saint Catherene's, it was too good to pass up, at least this time around."
19,1439,"Jan 26 2009 	not worth the price they charge	Did not experience bed bugs , but the room we had certainly was shabby, MAJOR stains on the carpets, paint peeling off the walls... would NEVER go back to this place. The only convenience was it's location but there are other great hotels in that area for close to the same price and much nicer and cleaner."
20,1439,Dec 20 2008 	Wish I read about the Bedbugs!!!	Slept alright. Funny thing is I broke out a few days later with a dozen bite marks on my arms and hands. No clue what it was til I checked out reviews on this place. Another person staying on the couch showed me a huged infected byte mark today on his finger he had wich confirmed to me that the origin was this hotel !!! Stay away. That's the last time I ever go there!If the problem was fixed like management listed in Aug...well it's back in room 1502! Woke up the last day to find a HHHHUUUGE spider up in the corner nesting! I swear we find those spiders out in the country! Maybe it's feeding on bed bugs who knows. If I could rate this place half a star I would just for convenience of being closed to downtown.
21,1439,"Dec 4 2008 	Stay far away	Had to go to Montreal for two days on business and stayed here because it was one of the few hotels on the approved list. When I checked in, I had a sense that it I had stayed here when I was in high school fifteen years ago, and when I went up to the room, my fears were confirmed. Didn't see any bed bugs but the place was so dirty and old that I ended up sleeping on top of the bedsheets fully clothed! After rushing through my meeting I decided to catch a late train and came home early rather than have to spend a second night. Grumpy staff made me pay 50% of the second night's rate for late check out; I was not impressed. You can do much better than this!"
22,1439,"Nov 6 2008 	It's a good place to stay. Not for people with ""expensive taste.""	Me and my friend decided to come go to Montreal January 08. We were 18 and this was our first BIG trip. We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights. Before booking this hotel I did some research. Besides the issue of bed bugs, i figured we could deal with 70's decor and poor elevators since we'd only really be using the place to sleep in and would be out all day. Well first we couldn't find the hotel. I think we passed it a good 4 times, but we had piss poor directions from Google Maps. Anyway, when we finally got there we checked in basically right away (there were like 2 groups ahead of us). Were told that the garage was closed and we'd have to come back in the morning to get a parking pass, no big deal. We parked on the streets that night.Getting up to our room, the place seemed find. A big space for 2 people. The furniture was old and mismatched but whoopdeefrickendoo! ITS A HOTEL PEOPLE! You want matching furniture? Stay at home! Everything was clean, the living room, bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom. Not like squeeky clean, but I didn't feel like I needed a hot shower after being there. And there were no bed bugs, which was good cause I hate bugs. I'm very impressed by the location too! It was like right next to St Catharine's Street which is where you want to be for shopping and night life. The first night we walked the wrong direction into a very seedy area of Montreal where, despite the below freezing weather, street walkers were till walking around in short skirts and fishnets. But, walk in the other direction, its a TOTALLY different story. You're only a few blocks from Crescent Street which has a bunch of bars and clubs.We were also only a couple steps away from the IGN...i think thats what it was called. Its a grocery store. We bought a lot of beer there to bring back to our room. We actually spent more time in the room than I had planned because of how cold it was out (go figure, January in Canada). So we'd sleep most of the day, go out and explore the Underground City, come back, sit around and watch TV and pre-game, then hit the city again at night. All in all, if you want a decent hotel at a good price in a good location, then this is it. I would watch out for bed bugs though. We probably lucked out. And don't listen to these naysayers about the furniture and stuff. It doesn't really matter."
23,1439,"Oct 1 2008 	Full of Bed Bugs/filthy	I stayed at this hotel which was advertised as a 3 star hotel. It presented well on the internet so I did not think I would have any problems staying there. I was attending an International conference and this was one of the recommended places to stay. This hotel is terrible. It is filthy, furniture is very shabby. The worst thing about my 5 night stay there was the BEDBUGS. I saw something in my bed. It was a small red bug. I killed it with a kleenex. I did not know at that time what a bed bug looked like. I saw blood spots on my pillow. The sheets were threadbare with holes in them. The mattress pad did not fit the bed. It looked like it was a small pad.I did not sleep at all while I was there.We complained to the front desk. Our room may have been &quot;fumigated&quot; while we were out but if you know anything about bedbugs they bite and are very difficult to get rid of.!! My friend was covered in large bites that appear in 3's. This place needs to be investigated asap by the Public Health board in Montreal. No compensation was ofered to us for the physical and psychological trauma my friend and I suffered. Do not go there. I notice there are several other negative reviews about this place on this site. Hope you read them as it seems this bedbug problem is ongoing!!"
24,1439,"Sep 30 2008 	Bedbugs	I stayed 5 nights in this hotel from September the 22nd to the 27th when in Montreal attending a Conference. This hotel was on the Conference Brochure and was about the middle of the price range of the hotels listed. I started getting bites by the second night. The staff do not seem at all concerned with the fact that the place is infested! When I complained and showed them my bites, I was given a very small box of chocolates and upgraded to a larger room that was just as bad. Keep away from this place!!!"
25,1439,"Sep 11 2008 	Cheap Price but at a High Cost	We decided relatively last minute to venture to Montreal for Labour day weekend. After reading the reviews on this hotel we were extremely reluctant to stay there but figured for $89 a night we could grin and bare it- because really what were the chances OUR room would have bugs in it? Upon arrival we were informed that their underground parking was full and we would have to park 2 blocks away, which was not happening because I think us girls packed enough luggage to move to Montreal. We opted to park on the street and take our chances. When we entered our room our first thought was that all of the mismatched furniture was probably from a garage sale but that ended up to be the least of our worries. We laid our sleeping bags on the bed (in fear of bugs we were NOT getting under the sheets). All was fine and well until a couple hours later-the first bug spotting on MY PILLOW. The hunt began and sure enough there were bugs all over the room!! We got the hotel to change the bed and slept that night with the lights on, zipped into our sleeping bags because we knew there was no chance of finding any other hotel that wasn't fully booked. We checked out of the hotel 2 days later disgusted but happy we didnt get any bites. UNTIL 3 days later when we all of a sudden were covered in them! Apparently it takes up to 9 days for bed bug bites to appear-almost 10 days later i am still covered in them! Honestly please take my advice and don't stay here, the hotel has a serious beg issue..the low price is not worth the devastation of being covered in bed bug bites!!"
26,1439,"Sep 8 2008 	For travellers on tight budget!	Reading some of the reviews here I was worried. The first thing I did when I entered the room was to undo the bed and lift the matress to find bugs but I didn't find any. Unfortunately, the whole hotel gave me the impression that bugs would actually come out at night and I didn't sleep well. The hotel itself needs renovations. The room was big, with a kitchen and lots of windows, but the carpet was dirty and there we hairs on the pillows. And the smell when we entered the room...yuck! The parking cost 16$ a day, and that was a surprise since the hotel we stayed the night before had free parking. Location is great, but no better than all the hotels in downtown Montreal. I recommend this hotel to people on tight budget, and to people who don't care what they sleep in."
27,1439,"Sep 7 2008 	Not that bad	After reading alot of the reviews I was worried about my stay here. But upon arrival I realized it wasn't that bad...at least not as bad as expected. It was rundown (carpets definitely needed to be redone) but overall was a typical room with a kitchen, sitting area and bathroom. overall it was maintained and clean. Although it was not a room to write home about it was a desent hotel with a great location and good staff."
28,1439,"Aug 29 2008 	Terrible condition bed bug INFESTATION	I went there with my girlfriend on a trip, hoping for everything to go smoothly. The hotel was the one thing I was counting on to at least be a decent place where we could sleep. We did sleep alright, in a nest of parasites. I woke up in the morning and had several bites all over my hands, feet, neck and face. Every exposed area on my skin was covered in bites. My girlfriend had something similar, but not as bad. We called for our room to get cleaned and the hotel was very slow and seemed to not care for our well being. Sadly I checked out and quickly went home with a ruined trip, and a very unhappy girlfriend. I ended up throwing away my clothes as I was afraid it would spread onto my carpets and other fuzzy furniture that those critters could burrow themselves into.I do not recommend this hotel to anybody, period. Even if you are the most experienced traveler, choose another place that cleans properly. This hotel is terrible."
29,1439,"Aug 26 2008 	LaTour Centre Ville Montreal-fudgetaboutit!	The La Tour Centre Ville is located in downtown Montreal in a good location. We had a mini-suite with a full kitchen, bath, livingroom and bedroom with two twin beds. Bathroom looks updated, they provide a blow dryer. Living room carpet was filthy and had several very big stains in the carpeting and the stained furniture looked right out of the 1940's, not in a good way. The hotel allows small pets so this might account for all the horrid ugly stains. Smelled musty. They provide a coffee pot, but no coffee, filters, cream or sugar. $16.50 a day extra to park under the hotel. One elevator out of two was not working while we were there. They have a so-so Chinese restaurant on site (waiter said I was the first person EVER to order an egg roll and seemed shocked that I did, they don't have any), and a small convenience store which you can purchase over priced breakfast with hash browns being a McDonald's type soaked in oil fried potatoe square. Hotel staff was nice, but gave us driving directions which landed us wrong way on one-way street twice. We would not stay there again."
30,1439,"Aug 11 2008	A Sleepless Night with Mom	We had the opportunity for a free lift to Montreal, and as a McGill graduate, I couldn't resist the chance to return to Montreal with my mom and relive the great weekends we used to share there. I chose this hotel based on the location and the price. In retrospect, I should have paid $100 more and had a more carefree weekend. I knew we'd be arriving pretty late, so I called the day of and spoke to a lady at the front desk to confirm that they wouldn't give away our room (I had also made a note in the initial reservation). We arrived to finding out our room HAD been given away and the guy at the front desk grunted to us that he would have to struggle to find us a room. 20 minutes later, he was swiping our keys when a big group of young men came out of the elevator and complained that the elevator was shaking (very reassuring!). We finally made it to our room on the 15th floor, which was a smoking room, and it smelled really bad. The bed cover was extremely stained. The bathtub was not clean. There were spiders on the windows. I felt horrible having dragged my mom back to Montreal to take her to this hell hole. To make matters room, at 2:30 in the morning we could hear a man knocking on doors and whistling in the hallway. We initially thought it was a creep going around knocking on strangers doors, but by 4:30 we realized we were on the 18 year old hormonal party floor. We weren't sure if we were in a youth hostel or a brothel! I did not fall asleep until 7:30 in the morning and we got up at 9:00 to start our only full day in Montreal. That morning I went down and complained and tried to have our room changed. The man at the front desk said that we should come back at 7:00pm, once people had checked out and more rooms were available. We came back at 6:00, and the guy tried to find us another room but couldn't find a room our size which was not smoking. Eventually he asked his female colleague for help. She argued with us for coming so late to complain (even though the other guy had told us to come back at 7:00!). Also she claimed that non-smoking rooms are never guaranteed, they are just preference, if available. After enough arguing we got a new non-smoking room on the 3rd floor, which was an entirey different experience. The kitchenette had been updated, the tv was larger (and not 70s vintage), the other clientelle were families, the bathroom was clean, the room had curtains, and our bed didn't squeak when you rolled over. Between having not slept the day before and all of the walking we did that day, we slept like rocks! We ended up having a great trip to Montreal, but the hotel was certainly not the highpoint! Next time I'll book earlier, splurge a bit more and leave La Tour for the teens and bugs!"
31,1439,"Aug 6 2008 	Worst hotel ever!	After my boyfriend and I booked this hotel we came to this site and saw a review that said the hotel had bed bugs. We really did not want to cancel our reservation mostly because of how great the location was but we also wanted to believe it wasn't true. The sad truth is, the review was absolutely accurate. There were little red begs in our bed both nights we stayed there. There were also spots of blood on our sheets. We had to ask the staff 3 times to change them and the third time they gave us new sheets that we had to put on the bed ourselves. Although the hotel is in a great location I do not think it is worth sleeping with bugs. I would NEVER EVER stay at this hotel again, even if it was for free!"
32,1439,"Aug 2 2008 	Only the location is good	We stayed in this place for two nights. We were unpleasantly surprised. The hotel makes a very shabby impression. The room was enormous, but filthy. Most of the staff is not up to the job, some of them made themselves remarks about how poor the hotel is!Some observations: Half of the electricity sockets did not work. Some of them fell out of the wall when you tried to use them!Our room was very noisy, street noise, noise from the corridor and the neighbours, although they were talking normally.The airconditioning worked but only took care of a small portion of the room. It was taped to the wall, no kidding!The carpet was old, full of staines and when we arrived showed the remains of the dinner our predesessors had left on the floor. The coffee can was broken, the windows dirty, on in and outside.Taking the elevator was a time consuming exercise, we had to wait anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes. I would always suggest to try to find another place, because this is just not worth the hassle."
33,1439,"Jul 22 2008 	We didn't stay - I couldn't - it was disgusting!	The location of this place is great, close to everything downtown, but even that couldn't convince us to stay. After waiting 30, yes 30 minutes for the elevator to come to the main lobby (only one of the two elevators was working, and the one that was working, stopped on almost every floor even though no one had called it!) and we were not the first in line, we finally got to our room on the 15th floor. I was already not pleased with the wait to get to our room, so I'm sure you can imagine how excited I was to open the door - the stale smoke smell, and the filthy carpet were enough for me to say 'that's it, i'm outta here!&quot; Add to that the fact that the A/C unit in the wall (very large) was taped together with duct tape, the windows and window wells had not been washed this year, the fact that a vaccuum had not seen under or around the bed, there were stains and cigarette burns on the 'comforter', the t.v. cables and wire were all over the floor for someone to trip on, the faucet in the washroom was leaky...need i go on? It was gross and wouldn't even take my shoes off let alone go near the bed...When we talked to the man at the counter, he said they were having an 'unlucky day'...We did not stay, nor do i recommend this place to anyone else."
34,1439,"Jul 17 2008 	Good Experience	Before leaving Toronto, I went online to read the reviews for this hotel and I was shocked and terrified of the amount of horror stories that people had experienced at this hotel. My boyfriend and I decided that we would wait until we got to the room and inspect it then make our decision whether we stayed for the weekend or not. We arrived late on July 11, 2008 checked into our room and discovered that they had given us a room with two twin beds when we reserved a smoking room with a queen bed. We went back to reception and they were very nice and switched our rooms immediately. We got our room on the 15th floor and immediately inspected the room for &quot;bed bugs&quot; or for any sign of bugs. The room was clean, kitchen was clean and no sign of bugs. Yes, I will agree the hotel is in need of major update. And definitely the hotel needs to address there &quot;bed bug&quot; issue, however our experience was fine. We enjoyed the convenience of the hotel being close to the Old Port. My boyfriend and I love to cook, therefore having a stove was nice when we got up in the morning. There is an IGA down the street about 2blocks. And downtown Montreal is in walking distance. I took pictures of the hotel for those rude people out there to prove that I am not lying. This is not the greatest hotel in the world, but honestly people YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. If you wanted a 5 star hotel spend the money. If you are on a budget and enjoy being close to everything go to this place. If the room is not up to your &quot;standards&quot; than cancel your reservation get your money back and go to a different hotel."
35,1439,"Jul 12 2008 	Bugs in the Bed La Tour Hotel!	I had 15 family members stay at La Tour Hotel Centreville July 3-5,2008 during the Montreal Jazz Festival. 1. Each room provided had faulty water temperatures in the shower. The water went from scolding hot to scolding cold during any shower experienced by each family member among all the rooms 2. In one room, no working toilet was provided. There were insects found in the bed. This room had an open whole in the window where a portable airconditioner was installed upon check-in. Hotel staff was untruthful regarding another available room during the night.When asked what the guest would do without a toilet during the night, the hotel staff responded that he didn't know and that maintenance would be by in the morning to correct the problem. Finally, the next morning of July 4, 2008 another room was provided that had previously not been occupied the night before.3. In a second room, the air conditioner did not work and upon repeatable requests to hotel staff to repair it, no reponse or remedy was provided. There was no electricity provided in the bedroom during the night of July 3, 2008.4. In a third room, the stove did not work. Maintenance came and could not fix it. Hotel staff suggested a room change. After accepting the room change, hotel staff completely forgot and no room change took place.5. In a fourth room,insects were found in the bed6. When a cot was requested, hotel staff coaxed a guest in our party to come and &quot;take a look at the cot&quot;. Upon arrival the guest was asked to take the cot back to their room. No hotel staff would bring the cot to the room. Hotel management has been un-responsive with our feedback."
36,1439,"Jul 11 2008 	Infested with SCABIES and BED BUGS	I will regret my stay at this hotel for the rest of my life. No amount of money saved is worth the horror of contracting parasites and the psychological distress of realising you've stayed in a room infested with bed bugs and could have brought them home with you. I still don't know if I have, I'm afraid of my bed and scan the frame and mattress with a flashlight every night before I go to sleep. It's costing me $100 for the medication to treat myself for the scabies and I will probably have to ask my fiance and my family to treat themselves too in case I infected them, so they can't re-infect me. If I did bring home bed bugs it will cost me thousands of dollars to exterminate and could take years to get rid of them. It is -not- worth it to stay here, spend a little more and pick a hotel where the staff actually care about keeping your room sanitary and bug free. As I see from other comments this is an ongoing problem at this hotel and that is -not- acceptable."
37,1439,Jul 2 2008 	dont stay here	this hotel is awful it's filthy ... the rooms stink there are holes in the sheets and blankets the carpets are full of cigarette burns ... our room hadnt seen a vacuum cleaner in weeks the man at reception couldnt have been less welcoming... not at all helpful the bathtub faucet ran ... not just a drip but water running constantly ... i would rather sleep on the street than stay in that hotel again
38,1439,"Jun 23 2008	was perfect my needs	I decided to have my bachelor party in Montreal. This hotel was perfect me and my friends needs. It was cheap, comfy, and had two beds in each room. Also, the rooms have kitchenettes and a pullout couch. So in essence, one room could fit 4-5 people."
39,1439,"Jun 11 2008	Held Hostage in La Tour!	We stayed in this &quot;hotel&quot; in June 2008 over the F1 race weekend at a cost of $350/night. We had 4 rooms booked with 3-4 people in each room. Upon arriving at the &quot;hotel&quot; and finding out our rooms had been conveniently located next to eachother (on the 2nd, 6th, 11th and 16th floors) we were shocked from the second we opened the door. The first thing you will notice is the stale smoke stench of each room. The furniture, walls, curtains and beds are all outdated and stunk. It took our goup about 3 minutes to go back to the front desk to inform them that there was no chance we would be staying there. The hotel manager graciously informed us they would cancel our reservation and only charge us for one nights accomadations. $350 x 4 rooms!!! What a joke. After a long argument with them, we realized we could not afford to do this as other hotels were charging much more also. The first night was horrible. 30 degree weather with no A/C is not my idea of a great vacation. After using all 3 towels in the room the first night we called the front desk the next morning to ask when the maid would be bringing more. We were told that they were out of towels and would have to call back later! Wonderful! We spent the whole day walking around the city without taking a shower in the morning. Aside from the blood stain on the couch, the pile of empty cans and garbage in the hallway (which sat there for 2 days), and the showerhead that shot off the wall every time we showered, this was a decent place to stay. I would hate to see the home of anyone who gave this &quot;hotel&quot; a decent rating."
40,1439,"Jun 11 2008	Dirty 	This hotel was the absolute pits. My friends and I could not believe we paid so much money to stay in such a horrible hotel. It's an absolute disgrace that they haven't renovated it. I have to admit the location was great, only a few minutes away from the bars and restaurants.However, the hallways had no A.C. the elevator always got stuck on the 15th floor so we'd have to wait, push the 16th or 14th floor, get off and walk up or down a flight of stairs. the rooms were disgusting. the carpets were horrible and had stains everywhere. the living room coffee table, dresser and table to eat off of were all different furniture and were a different color. I can keep writing for days as to how bad our experience was. we had gone up for grand prix weekend and paid an arm and a leg for 4 nights. My recommendation, bite the bullet and pay an extra 50 bucks a night and stay somewhere really nice. it's so much more worth it and having a piece of mind that your hotel is clean is key."
41,1439,"Jun 9 2008 	Not too impressed	We stayed at this hotel because of a recommendation from a friend on the basis of it's central location. There were good things but lots of problems. It WAS a great location - easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go (or to a Metro station for those farther away) and we were very happy with the location. We stayed in 2 rooms - in the first there were 3 of us and we had one of the larger rooms on the 14th floor and it was fine. No complaints other than rather dated decorating. The second room however was a different story. We were moved to the 2nd floor and there were only 2 of us so it was to a smaller room (we choose to do this). The room however, was not very good. The following were our complaints:1) Curtains were stained (brown) and had holes in them2) There were cigarette holes in the sheets (it was a non-smoking room).3) The fridge light was out4) The power outlets in the kitchen above the sink were dead5) The pillows were not very comfortable6) The outlet on the stove came out of the stove when removing a plug7) The view out the window was of a Honda service station8) There was no hotel info in the room (including what time was check out etc; this was true of both rooms).9) There was no climate control in the room10) We had a ridiculously loud noise in our room that seemed to be air in the water pipes - sounded like a trumpet going off both early in the morning and at night. This was the worst because none of the staff attempted to remedy the problem - which kept us up.11) One of the elevators was broken on our last night and were still broken the next day (when we were checking out) and all the access to the stairs said they were alarmed. We ended up going out them anyway as we couldn't get out any other way (elevator that was working was full)12) Despite asking for our room to be cleaned, our bathroom was only superficially cleaned. While we got new towels, our old ones remained on the back of the door and some dirt on the floor was there after the cleaning as well. When all is said and done though, it was a fine place to stay - we didn't have any really significant issues, just irritations at the end of our stay."
42,1439,"May 26 2008 	Great location	I stayed at this place twice (the last time in March 07) and both times had a pretty nice experience. I have to say that I found the hotel a bit ran down since my previous visit (in January 05). It could definitely use some renovations.Overall, my room was clean, and we had no issues (no bed bugs as some other reviewers seem to have found). The people in the main desk were helpful, and when we needed to stay an extra night, we were charged the same amount as per our reservation, although the upfront price was about $30 higher.The location is great (across the street from the American Consulate, in downtown, minutes away from subways stations, Montreal's main information center, and Le Complex de Jardins - I hope I spelled it right)."
43,1439,"May 20 2008	The Manager is rude......	Thanks, we stayed only for one night. This hotel is so outdated, carpet floor is so disgusting, even the doors can't be closed, kitchen is dirty, bed is hard like a wood floor. We have a 6 mos old baby which she couldn't sleep because the room was so warm even if AC is functioning. So we called the management almost middle of the night, they responded they can't do anything because there is no maintenance people present at that time.What frustrate us a lot is about the advertisement on the website that RATES INCLUDED BREAKFAST (in bold letters), this is one thing I considered when I booked the hotel but surprisingly, hotel never served us breakfast. The Manager said that breakfast is not included, the excused he made is the rates is already low and breakfast is only free for Grey Cup Promo. We said RATES INCLUDED BREAKFAST is wriiten on the front page of the website with no specific exclusions and I showed the print out I have on-hand, after some discussions, the manager committed he would give us a discount equivalent to our breakfast, but as soon as we checked out, the manager (his name is Rashid) denied about the discount, said he never said giving us the discount. When we tried to make a conversation, he raised his voice and shouted on us. What a terrible experience, we are Canadians and we are giving our cousins a little tour of Canada (our cousins came from Netherlands). Its frustrating, really a bad experience. What we want to know, if hotels are allowed to put all the nicest things people are looking for when booking on a hotel but ignoring their promises after ckecking in on the hotel."
44,1439,"Apr 15 2008 	Crabby hotel	We stayed at the Tour Centre Ville for two nights in the freezing cold but cosy and beautiful Montreal. Our room on the 14th floor had a magnificent view, and the room was very large. That's the only positive thing to say about this hotel, which seems to be in a desperate need for renovation. The room was so shabby and the furniture, beds and carpets were disgusting. Everywhere in the hotel small pieces of wallpaper were falling apart. We paid about 90 canadian dollars per night and that didn't even include breakfast which was to be bought in the expensive cafe next to the lobby. The staff were okay but not more than that, and the pool on the top floor seemed so dirty, that I was sure to be sick if I went for a swim there. My girlfriend did, and got sick the following night. The saunas didn't work, but seemed very dirty as well.Not recommedable until major revation has been done."
45,1439,"Mar 7 2008 	It is not as bad as everybody makes it out	After I had booked this hotel I found the reviews here and began to worry and almost canceled my stay but am so glad I didn't. Yes the rooms are out dated but overall they are very clean, tons of room (they look like they used to be one bedroom apartments). And I stayed for 3 nights in a large suite for under $275. Really can't beat that. Its right downtown and there is a IGA close by as well as the metro. The front desk was a lot of help and very friendly. I hope these reviews do not stop anyone from this. It isn't fancy but it will do for anybody."

However, several weeks later itchy rashes began appearing on all 4 girls from the room. We later found out we contracted scabies from this hotel.

48,1439,"Oct 2 2007 	Terrible place	stayed at this hotel October 1st with 3 adults and a child , first of all we checked in and went to our room the room was terrible looked liked a 3rd world country inn. ripped and old sofa's carpets dirty, curtains had holes kitchen very disgusting( but who needs a kitchen) thank God i flipped over the bed covers, I saw hair and fuzz all over the bed the bed sheets werent changed but the bed was made, cumbs under the beds and sofa's...i wanted just to get out and move to another hotel, but my husband said we should try another room. we changed our room to the 14th floor, same Picture but the bed sheets were changed, stayed the whole day outside just came in to the room to sleep thats it, told my child to not to touch anything in the room... i still get itches all over me when i think about this place, the price wasnt even economical we paid 170 .00 dollars for 1 night and we had to because husband had a meeting right across the street which was very close.. Never again i will return to this place...."
49,1439,"Sep 27 2007 	4 college kids loved it	Stayed there during winter and had a blast. no complaints. lobby was full of some drama and maybe high school kids, but it didn't bother us. location was perfect for going out at night. small kitchen and small living room was just what we needed. view was incredible too. little cafe downstairs made some excellent egg sandwiches"
50,1439,"Sep 18 2007 	bed bugs!!!!!!	OK, I've stayed at a lot of hotels, but this was my first experience with Bedbugs, and an unhelpful staff.I woke up at 5:00 in the morning with an itch on my chest, and noticed a bug (I didnt assume it was a bedbug right away) crawling on me. I opened my eyes further and noticed no less then 5 others crawling all over the bed next to me. DISGUSTING!!!!So I brought 3 of them down to the lobby in a glass and showed him, and his answer was &quot;I can't kill them all&quot; UGGH!After some haggling he offered me another room 5 floors up.I wish I could give this place a 0 unfortunately terrible (1 star) is the lowest option available."
51,1439,"Sep 5 2007 	Clean budget hotel with very accomodating service	I would definitely recommend the budget-conscious traveller to stay here. Location is key for this hotel which is situated between the &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; sectors of Montreal. Perfect for first timers to Montreal as you can easily go south toward the Port and historical sites or north toward the shopping and museums. It is also right in between two major Metro lines which is just a few blocks walk away in either direction. Staff is friendly and accomodating to say the least. At first, we had one of the older, non-renovated rooms which is spacious with a kitchenette. But after being waken up in the middle of the night by inconsiderate drunk college kids, the hotel upgraded us to a huge suite on a different floor the very next morning. Last, but not least, the hotel staff was very helpful in answering our million questions, recommending wonderful restaurants, and being prompt in any of their services to help make our vacation run as smoothly as possible. For this reason alone would I stay here again when I return to Montreal!"
52,1439,"Aug 14 2007	It's ok...	This is a pretty old place, with old furniture, decor, paint, fixtures... so keep your expectations low. And I agree with the other reviewers that there is this unpleasant industrial solvent type smell that reminds me of cheap motels that I have stayed in. I judge my comfort level by my willingness to take off my shoes and socks inside and walk around. In this place, I kept them till I got in bed. And put them on when I got up.The lady at the checkin doubles as phone operator, so even with one person in line in front of me, I had to wait over half an hour before I got my room. I paid $130 before taxes for this room (a large suite) booked online. It was a huge room, but so poorly and sparsely furnished that the large gaps between the odd piece of furniture made the suite rather uncosy. I didn't spend any time in the living room at all.Personally, I'd rather pay an extra $30 and get something more updated. I don't think I'll come back. I'm glad my wife wasn't with me. She wouldn't have been happy.Hope that's useful to someone."
53,1439,"Jun 8 2007	excellent place	Great place to stay. The rooms were extremely cute and convenient. We stayed in bed until noon one morning, left for downtown at 1 oclock and the room still got cleaned. The location is wonderful. Two blocks from Cathedral st. and a 20 min walk to old town montreal. The underground shopping is close and the casino is a 15$ cab ride."
54,1439,Jun 5 2007 	Great stay at La Tour	This is a great hotel for the price. And the location is awesome. It was quiet and comfortable. They were able to give me an early check in and were able to answer all my questions. Nice pool on the top floor. Would recommend if you don't have a car and need a place in a good location. The parking and internet cost extra but the room rate is good.
55,1439,"Jun 5 2007 	Amazing Location Huge Rooms Decent Price	The rooms at this hotel are HUGE. The facilities at the hotel are a little older -- the pool could definitely use a makeover -- but were clean enough. But the big thing here is that the location is AMAZING -- just a close walk to some great restaurants, great shopping, and great bars/clubs. When you stay here you are paying for huge rooms and a great location. The front desk staff had some good tips. I'd definitely reccommend for budget-conscious travelers like myself."
56,1439,"Mar 15 2007	What is Respect for Customers?	Upon arrival to hotel, we tried to check in. it was the most amazing the because the woman at 1st did not acknowledge I was standing at the desk. Finally when I got her attention, she told me I was not registered. I gave her a copy of the confirmation from their own website and everything, but she insisted I was not registered. She was very rude and sassy. I requested a manger because I drove over 7 hours, crossed a border, and had confirmation in my hand on online! Another lady came to the counter, Joy/Toni; something like that; well she was more pleasant than the initial woman. She only found my reservation instantly. She informed me my room would not be ready for at least another 1-2 hours. No problem I thought! However when I returned, I guess I was blackballed. I didnt go up to the counter, because it was the same initial woman and I didnt want any more conflict. I sent my mate and he retrieved the key to our room. When I got into the room, I was quite disappointed. In addition, it did not seem like what I had reserved. I called the front desk and that is when I spoke to Mr F(----), he told me that was his name when I asked him after return to the front counter because he refused to answer any questions about the room over the phone. I did not see this guy during the whole check-in progress, but he must have heard about the Americans!!! This man was very rude when I approached the counter; I was at this time very upset. Here I was in Canada with no where to stay; I cancelled my reservation at Residence Inn! A woman came to the counter, louisette pion-general manager, and kept telling me I was talking loud, yet this guy was yelling at my and swearing!! She was excusing his behavior stating he was new and on probation. Things really went wild because after all the profanity, including his profane name, he walked off the job stating he quick, I dont need this ----. At this point the general manager blamed me and asked if I was going to work in his place. I must have been on candid camera Canadian style where they never tell you, because I never, ever, ever went through this in all my life. Well, the guy came back and he apologized, I did not accept. I told the woman I would be checking out and did not expect to have to pay for this room or parking. I called Residence Inn and they werent booked. I went there and was greeted in a totally different way. I guess you get what you pay for!!!"
57,1439,"Jan 11 2007 	It was not as good as I expected	We stayed at La Tour Centre Ville for 2 nights in September 2006.When we arrived at the hotel, the only front desk staff was talking on the phone, so we had to wait to check-in for a long time.Our room (Small Suite) was big enough, but one queen-sized bed was small for us.Overall, the room was NOT clean.-There were a lot of fingerprints on the windows.-Bed sheet was very crumpled, so it seemed not to be changed.If your first priority about accommodations is cleanliness, I NEVER recommend you staying this hotel.The location was OK. It was a 10-minute walk to go to Metro station, Chinatown, and Old Montreal.Cafe Bistro at the 1st floor was good. Croissant egg and cheese sandwich (breakfast special) was delicious! But they didn't have croissant when we went there again, so I ordered bagel instead. It was not bad, but croissant was better. If you can, you have to try it!"
58,1439,"Nov 24 2006 	Not-so-suite for the budget-minded traveler	We were looking for an affordable base camp for a family weekend getaway in Montreal, and chose it because it was a low-priced suite option in downtown, convenient to many attractions. Strengths: it's a short walk to the heart of the financial district, shopping on St. Catherine's St. &amp; the underground malls, and close by McGill Univ. Gripes: suite was small for a family of four, beds are uncomfortable, furnishings were slightly dingy, indoor pool was chilly &amp; tiny. Garage parking is available, but adds $14/day (US) to the price. We've stayed at several small Euro-style Montreal hotels &amp; found Le Tour less hospitable than most of these, overall--e.g. no coffee in the lobby or continental breakfast included. A good choice for budget-minded travelers, but look elsewhere if you're looking for more creature comforts, or a location closer to some of Montreal's best neighborhoods for walking &amp; dining out."
59,1439,"Aug 5 2006 	Great Location	This Hotel is in a GREAT location, you can basically walk to all the Tourist attractions - Notre Dame, St. Catherine Street, St. Denis, and others. There is a grocery store right across the street called IGA. The Hotel itself isn't the most modern but on the plus side it has a kitchen which will save you a lot of money if you just cook your breakfast and lunch. The rooms are average looking, nothing fancy. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for the suite experience in downtown but want to save money.Plus sides-Great locationFriendly receptionKitchen to save moneycomfortable bedsGood TV channelsNegatives-You have to pay for parkingThe elevator is REALLY slowCould use some renovationsHotel hallways had a bad smell at first but it went awayshowers water temps were unpredictable at timesWith all that being said, I would stay there again"
60,1439,"May 28 2006	It's practical because is in downtown. Not bad...	I stayed in this hotel with my wife for one week. I was moving to Montreal, so it was important for me to have a centric hotel with a kitchenette.I think that you get what you pay for.The bad things:1- The heater (since we stayed in a chilli season) was a little bit too noisy. And since it was right in front of the bed you went from covering yourself to uncovering, hot, cold, hot, cold. But you get used to it.2- The rug in front of the bathroom's door was a little bit lose and had small nails uncovered (dangerous for a senior or kid, or a sleepy person going to the bathroom).The good things:1- Very very comfortable bed. Actually now that we moved to an appartment we went back to the hotel to ask the brand of the bed. (its Simmons beautyrest)2- It has the kitchenette, practical if you are staying for a long period and you don't want to spend in restaurants 3 times per day.3- It has wireless internet in the lobby. 4- The service of the ladies in the lobby was ok, you won't receive smiles everytime you go ask them something but its ok, they help you.4- Centric. But there are more hotels in the area. So this one doesn't count.So I do recommend this hotel for people staying long periods."
61,1439,"Mar 26 2006 	A horrible experience	On april 2005, my friends and I went to Montreal for a meeting. The hotel made an overbook mistake. The manager and counter ladies attitudes were arrogant and had strong quarrel with us. Our travel agency communicated with them and got false information and negative response also. That's really a nightmare."
62,1439,"Jan 7 2006	Bad smell there	This hotel looks nice until you open the door to your room (mine was on 14th floor, southern side). The smell was bad, the living room's coffee table was missing a leg, the working chair's bottom was smashed and had to be replaced, there was a lot of strange stains (white stains on the sofa, red stains on the lamp, vomit under the lamp's table). The windows looked like some kind of tinted film was peeling off from them. The furniture looked used and old. The refrigerator in the kitchen was a yellow oldie. We had no microwave but they brought one when we asked for it.On the plus side, the bathroom looked new and clean. The room was big enough. The inside garage is high enough for an Astro minivan (our ski rack just rubbed the garage door)."
63,1439,"Jan 3 2006	Great place to stay	I have stayed at La Tour Centre-Ville every year from 1996 to 2005 with the exception of 2000. In 2003, I stayed there twice. With as many trips as I've had to this hotel, I've stayed in many different rooms from 2 of the studio apartments, to 4 of the suites, to 4 of the grand suites. Each of the 10 rooms I've stayed in have been differnent (some were before the renovations in the late 90's) but they have all been clean and well kept.Pros: Location, location, location. You do not need a car if you stay here. Everything is within walking distance and the metro is very close by. For the location and size of the room, you can't beat the price. The furniture is not anything special, but it is adequate for its purpose. The beds have always been comfortable. You also get a kichenette for the price. Out of the 7 Jazz Festivals I've been to, I would have to say that this hotel has handled the large ammounts of guests and musicians with great organization. I have never had to wait for check-in or check-out. The rooms are clean. Some of them may not be sterile, but the beds and bathrooms were always clean and never freaked out my germophobe fiancee. In 2005, the Chinese restaurant came under new ownership and the food is great!Cons:This is an old building, so it is not anything like the Westin or Hilton. It's a moderate hotel that puts function above form. There is no stairway from the hotel rooms to the lobby and the elevators can take a while, but that never bothered me. One out of the 10 times I stayed there, there was some problems with the air conditioning, but that was fixed in a timely manner.I will continue to return to this hotel. When I started going there in '96, I was a poor college student and that was all I could afford. These days, I can afford a more expensive hotel, but I don't see any reason to pay more for a hotel with an inferior location."
64,1439,"Oct 5 2005 	Excellent place to stay in heart of Dowtown Montreal !!!	This hotel was an excellent buy, with private bedroom, sleeper sofa, kitchenette and overall great staff. The location cant be beat, with its downtown location, just steps to underground Montreal and the Metro, and a few blocks from Vieux Montreal and Chinatown. Getting to this hotel was extremely easy as well.Each room is equipped with a small kitchenette (stove, refrigerator, sink with dishpan and dishsoap, table and chairs) plus utensils, plates, coffee cups, glasses, and even wine glasses. Secure, indoor parking is offered for an additional fee. More than anything, this is in a great location... You can walk to everything from the hotel. I would definitely go back."
65,1439,"Aug 11 2005	Great place to stay in downtown if you're on a budget	I went down to Montreal for a week with some friends from my University. We're students and we wanted a hotel that was affordable but clean. I felt really lucky to have found this place. This is an apartment hotel, so the suite that we got for about $94/night had two twin beds in a separate bed room, a full living room with pullout couch, a small dining room and a full furnished kitchen. We must have saved $300 that week because we didn't have to eat out all the time. There was a full grocery store right across the street. On the top floor, the &quot;penthouse level&quot; there is a laundry, meeting rooms, a pool, a weight room (male and female) and a sauna (male and female) - open for all. The location is right downtown and we could walk to the bars, chinatown, and old montreal in about 15min walk in different directions - not next door to any, but central to all these places. I went for runs by the harbour a few blocks away.We had some good parties in our hotel room with all the space, hit up the pool and sauna too. I can also see this to be a place my parents would stay at though - a lot of the people who stay here long-term in the furnished apartments are very nice middle age or older folk. If you get a top floor, the view is pretty great. There's this old beautiful church right across from us, and beyond stretched the city of montreal.This was a well-kept place and I found the hotel staff excellent and professional. The maids even cleaned our fridge, did our dishes and emptied our garbage one of the days - &quot;no way!&quot; I said when I came back. One of the guys at the desk wasn't the most outward friendly guy, but I think his suit was too stiff - and check-in was very smooth. The only thing that annoyed me were extra charges: having to pay for parking and local calls - but I still saved money because 1) parking would have been more anywhere else downtown and 2) I could cook!Yours,LDRP.S. I read the bad reviews with the good on this site. This is not a five star hotel, and I think it's good because I don't live a pampered life. I can see people who expect five luxury hilton when they show up to be sorely disappointed. I shop around for trips with a budget, and after going on many trips, this was one of the best deals I've ever found downtown in a major North American city."
66,1439,"Aug 5 2005	What a Dump	We booked three rooms over 90 days in advance but when we arrived they only had two available. In order to get a crib for the room I had to go to the hotel storage and get it myself but our son did not spend any time in it because it was a deathtrap! The room was large but run down and filled with outdated furniture and applicances. There was no headboard on the bed which gave us a lovely view of the exposed electric cord for the wall lamp. The thermostat was broken and had to be fixed. The blowdryer was broken and had to be replaced. There was a thick layer of dust on the shelves in the closet and no one had cleaned under the bed for at least a month. Paint was peeling off of the walls. Hot water came out of the tap at close to boiling (ouch!). The staff was rude, incompetent and remarkably slow. Speaking of remarkably slow, we often waited in excess of 15 minutes for the elevator. There are no stairs to the lobby. There are no highchairs in the cafe. They did not inform us that there was a charge for parking so we were surprised to receive a bill when we checked out. Local phone calls cost $1.50 and must be charged to a credit card (not to the bill for the room.)Great location near St. Catherine's and Vieux Montreal but a terrible hotel."
67,1439,"Jun 20 2005 	A Nice Surprise	After reading several mixed reviews we were a little worried about this place, but we actually found it a wonderful surprise!! We've stayed in several places in Montreal - this was the cheapest and it had everything we needed for our three day stay in the middle of January. The room was large, clean and comfortable, we had a great view of the city, the little kitchenette was equipped with everything we needed and it even had a pool on the top floor. Make sure to say if you are a member of CAA/AAA as you get a very good discount. It's location is good, a two minute walk to the US Embassy, and not far from Chinatown. Parking is under the hotel - great in winter. We had to cut our stay a little shorter than originally planned and had no problem cancelling the last night of our stay - we had to give 24 hours notice and didn't have to pay any cancellation fee. All in all, if you want a very reasonable, clean and well located hotel, I would definitely recommend it."
68,1439,"Mar 25 2005	Great!	After living in Montreal for many years I returned with a family member a few months ago and stayed here. We stayed in a suite, with a livingroom, diningroom area, kitchen and bedroom with two beds. great price, about 160$C/night, or somewhere thereabouts. I can tell you the location is great if you want to do touristy stuff, eat good food and live the nightlife in montreal. If you're in town for a hockey game (the strike will end some day, I'm sure) or there to party, this is great too. Close to the Bell Centre and St. Laurent, enough room for lots of people, and you can prepare your own meals. If you can't walk, use the Metro system rather than drive. Its faster, closer and goes everywhere you want to go. Montreal is beautiful, so let's keep it that way by not smogging the air!I didn't talk to the staff too much, use the services or the TV. So I can't say much about all that. My parents stayed here before, too, while visiting, and they liked it. It doesn't have bugs, I didn't see any stains and no unbearable noise, either.No matter where you stay, be glad montreal exists. It is like no where else!"
69,1439,"Oct 18 2004	NO Customer Service skills at all	Good location and cheap. It's a pity they have no concept of Customer Service.We and and another two guests were given room sizes we had not booked-- a double bed instead of a room with two beds. No apology was given at all. One poor young man was left waiting in that crowded tiny lobby for another hour until his room was ready. Check-in time was 3:00 and he had to wait until 4:00 and the staff told him there was no room to store his luggage in the meantime. No one offered to store it in the room while it was being cleaned. When a friend tried to intervene on my behalf with the bed shortage problem, the manager basically told him to shut up. I hope foreign guests don't judge Canada or Montreal from their experience at this hotel."
70,1439,"Sep 25 2004	Simply perfekt!!!!	Visiting Montreal we stayed at the LA TOUR CENTRE VILLE for 3 nights. We had a very spacious apartment: Living room with a dining area, functional kitchenette, sleeping room with comfortable bed (very good mattress), Modern and clean bathroom.There are several wall-cupboard in the apartment, so you have enough space for your clothes. Everything was very clean and suitable. The location is great, espacially if you are with a car. The hotel is easy to find and the price for a parking-lot in the garage (15 CAD each day) is low. Most Montreal attractions can be reached by feet (gorgious shopping malls - just 5 minutes away). The next subway station is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel. We really felt like home and can recomment this location to everyone!!"
71,1439,"Sep 23 2004	A Regular Satisfied Customer	For work reasons, I have been booking with La Tour Centre Ville about once a year for the past five years or so. Definitely, for the money that I have paid compared to other three-star accommodations, I have been very satisfied with the quality of the rooms. Some rooms have a larger seating area than others but even the smaller rooms are still a comfortable size. As far as cleanliness, I have felt quite comfortable -- on occassion I have even seen worse in more expensive hotels. As far as accessibility to important sites, the location is excellent. For those of us who count every single dollar, having a kitchenette in the room and an IGA within walking distance is a huge benefit.As in the past, I continue to recommend La Tour Centre Ville for affordable, convenient and comfortable accommodation.Neema LukumbuzyaOttawa, Ontario"
72,1439,"Aug 12 2004 	Had some problems	Location of the hotel is excellent and that is the only good thing about this hotel. The entire hotel has horrible smell of smoke, dust and cheapest deodorants. The entering hall is so tiny and unproportional to the number of guests staying. I was waiting 35 minutes to check in as 2 receptionists were too slow with the customers, answering incoming phones etc. I was standing in the line as there were not chairs in the hall and little appology would cheer me up. As for my room, I had large suite 206. The furniture is functional, TV is old, remote control did not work even I asked to fix it, bathroom's door can not be closed. Don't expect to enjoy the view of downtown from your room's window as they never have been cleaned, and the drapes are so filthy you don't want come closer to open the window! And yes, they clean room every day and change towels, but is't that what they supposed to do in any hotel? At the end I left hotel with the feeling I was cheated even for that &quot;reasonable&quot; price.But Montreal and Quebec were super! Enjoy."

9,1450,Mar 25 2009 	Never stay there they are cheats and liers	I booked the hotel for a 3 night stay through Hotels.com over the phone and asked specifically that time to the agent while booking if the parking was included because parking is ridiculously priced in Montreal and can be very expensive. I was specifically told multiple times by the representative that it is included with the cost of renting the rooms and Iwould not be charged anything extra for it. I was told multiple times since I asked multiple times specifically about the parking charges. Anyways when I went to Montreal to rent the room
10,1450,Mar 18 2009 	Don't believe the bad reviews... it's FINE!	I don't know what these people are complaining about. Le Roberval is a 2.5 star hotel and is much nicer than most other hotels with that rating. For $96/night we got a spacious suite with living room
11,1450,Sep 10 2008 	Absolutely Terrible - Spend the Extra Money and Never Stay Here	This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I stayed here with 5 friends at the end of August of 2008. We loved the idea of the family suites where we could all stay in the same unit together. We should have went with two rooms at a Best Western.When we go there we were immediately a little disappointed.. the room was very dim and not as large as advertised. Only one bathroom as well. The floor was cold and the bathroom didn't steamed up very quickly. Since we thought we were getting a good deal we let that slide. The next day we realized that staff didn't come and clean the rooms
12,1450,Sep 2 2008 	Good value but only smoking rooms	The room was large and had a clean kitchenette. The only problem is that I booked a non smoking room to find out that most rooms are for smokers and so we also got one. It was clean

The kids slept on the sofa bed (when of those that open up). Internet access was complimentary with excellent speed but required an Ethernet cable (no Wi-Fi). Breakfast was and excellent and also complimentary. There is also a computer in the lobby anyone can use. Parking costs $15/day. You may park for free overnight on a back street until 9:00am. Hotel location is very convenient and close to many attractions. Staff at front desk was very friendly and helpful. This hotel was great deal for the money. Definitely recommended for budget travelers.	
16,1450,Jul 29 2008	some glitches-but ironed out!!	over all a good value but webooked it thru the quebec wayside booth and found they had wanted 15 extra for our daughter to stay even though we had a reservation printed for 3!! i insisted we hold firm and they did that but what a hassle entering after a long drive and getting the stonewall there! not professional- the night staff. we liked the clean rooms but were upset that the kitchen was there and that we had to clean the cups and coffee maker or not get our 250 usd deposit back! good location for the village
17,1450,May 14 2008 	Not a bad hotel for the price	Overall stay was a pleasant one. The staff were helpful and friendly.We booked our hotel in Montreal this time based on price and location (we were heading to the Jacques Villeneuve circuit the next day) and kept in mind that it was only going to be used for one night to lay our heads. This was a good choice for that. It is in the vicinity of the University of Quebec
18,1450,Oct 16 2007	not so good	The concpet of a kitchen in the hotel room is great but if it is not cleaned it is a disgusting idea. It does not make any sense to pay extra money to have a kitchen cleaned and it makes even less sense to not clean it at all. The room was big and comfortable
19,1450,Jul 31 2006	good value	We crossed the border from the States into Canada and called at the Tourist info. They were very helpful and booked us into this hotel. We were a little worried about the distance from the centre and the external appearance. However once inside we were pleasantly suprised
20,1450,Sep 6 2005	Basic hotel- but not recommended	Upon checking in we got a small
21,1450,May 24 2005	Enjoyed stay	Cute very very clean hotel
22,1450,Oct 4 2004	Great Location and Price	I have stayed at Le Roberval on two occasions and have a reservation for a weekend in November. The hotel is located in the Latin Quartier near the UQAM-Berri subway. The suites are nice with hardwood floors

1,1455,"Nov 14 2009 	Was I staying at the same hotel as the others?	Traveling with spouse and friends for first time visit to Montreal. At check-in Bellman asked what papers we would like to receive .. got none Large rooms but both of them had extremely uncomfortable beds and pillows. Friends received turn down service we received nothing and are members of Loews First, they are not. Concierge sent us on wild goose chase that cost us quite a few bucks only to return to hotel neighborhood to find what we were looking for on our own. Beware of rooms on street side as weekend partying gets intense into the wee hours. Other Loews we have stayed at always professional and memorable. This one needs some help!"
2,1455,Nov 13 2009 	Large Rooms City Center	Nice hotel. Great Location. Very child friendly. Carpet in the room could use replacing and room service could use a little work.
3,1455,"Oct 15 2009 	Week-end getaway made perfect	Big, bright, beautiful room, with a bed so large, I joked with my wife that I needed a shuttle bus to get around it! Most comfortable bed I have ever encountered. Bathroom was of spotless marble. Front desk staff, concierge and door-men were lovely genuine people who went out of their way for us. Hotel bar and restuarant are small upscale brass, mahogony and candle-lit. Hotel is around the corner from St. Catherine St. and with the new Bixi Bikes all over the downtown, a short bike ride from all of the downtown. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby. Do not be concerned about the reports of noise. Friday and Sat. night there was activity on the street, but nothing to bother us trying to sleep. I would be more worried if the hotel was right on St. Catherine, but it is not."
4,1455,"Oct 11 2009 	Great hotel in Montreal	The Loews is next to great shopping, but a bit far from Old Montreal town. You'd have to cab it there. The rooms were quite nice - very comfortable beds, flat screen TV, big tub, robes, umbrella in the closet, stereo to plug in your iphone/ipod. The front desk was also very helpful in helping us find a restaurant. The parking at the hotel is $33/day (you can go in/out). However, if you're planning to go in/out, there is an outside parking lot right next to the hotel for $20 for 24 hours."
5,1455,"Oct 8 2009 	Always meets or surpasses expectations...	We've been going to the Loew's Vogue at least once a year for the past several years. One of their better traits is the consistent superb experience in dealing with their staff at all levels. They are always bright, helpful, and sincere. We cannot recollect a situation that was handled in the best possible way by this boutique hotel. Not only are they centrally located in Montreal to all the best shopping and most of the high dining establishments but they are regarded as a pet friendly place. They treat customer's pets as though they are customers in their own right. Loews Vogue keeps us coming back time and again to Montreal as they keep their charm."
6,1455,"Oct 6 2009 	The perfect getaway hotel in downtown Montral	We stayed at the Vogue for 3 nights and were very satisfied with the hotel. Upon arrival just around lunch time, the rooms were already prepared for check-in. We booked a sweet deal package in a Luxury King room which included continental breakfast by room service. Without any fuzz you could upgrade the breakfast to include eggs and ham etc for a few dollars. As the hotel did not have any breakfast buffet (only ala carte in the Cellini restaurant) the room service option was very convenient. Everyone in the staff were very helpful and accomodating everytime. Rooms were large and comfortable and the bathroom featured a flat screen tv, bubble bath and a separate shower cabin. Our in-room coffee maker with complimentary coffee was used several times a day. The only downsides were that you could not adjust the temperature in the room, just turn the a/c on or off. It did not bother us much though so we never called and asked if that was something they could do anything about. Traffic can be bothersome somtimes so if you are easily disturbed by noise from the street, bring earplugs or ask for a courtyard room if they have any. Just a hint, do NOT go to the Cellini restaurant for drinks. The hotel bar Opera was full so we went to the restaurant instead. Nice and friendly service and all but the bartender had absolutely no clue of how to mix drinks. A better advice is to order drinks from Opera and bring them to the lounge area by the reception."
7,1455,"Sep 29 2009 	Clean Quiet Great Service	My wife and I stayed here during the first two days of a trip around Quebec. Service from the moment we pulled up was prompt, efficient and professional. All requests were handled professionally and with a smile. Bed was extremely comfortable and the views of the city from our room were great (and suprisingly quiet). Room service was fast and the food was great. One of the better 'smoked meat' sandwhiches I had on the whole trip. We will certainly stay here again when in the area."
8,1455,"Sep 13 2009 	Service with a smile	From the outset, the front desk, the doorman and the concierg always referred to as Mr and Mrs. so and so. As the hotel is somewhat small, this intimacy made the experience very special.The rooms were decent size, beds were dreamy and the bathrooms were oversized . We had a corner room with 3 large windows.We used the valet services for our car. They were quite prompt in bringing our car to the front of the hotel. We used taxis at night and they were easily summoned by the doorman.The small lobby had free wifi.This downtown location is close to most of the business and tourist venues"
9,1455,"Sep 10 2009 	Very nice location - comfy bed!	I just visited Montreal with my mom and we stayed at Loews Vogue for 3 nights. Great location - right by Rue Sainte-Catherine in downtown, great location if you love to shop. Also there are lots of great restaurants and nightlife near by. Walking distance to a metro station, comfy beds, large bathroom, also if you are jogger you will be close enough to jog to Old Montreal or Mont Royal in the morning. I highly recommend it."
10,1455,"Aug 26 2009 	Top notch service	I'm late with this review, but needed to say that we loved this hotel when we visited Montreal at the beginning of this year. On a totally crazy whim, we decided to go to Montreal in the dead of winter. And not to ski. Man oh man, it was absolutely frigid that weekend! So cold that the windshield wiper fluid froze the moment it hit the windshield. But the room made the whole trip totally worthwhile.It was a couple of days after my daughter's 8th birthday, which I must have mentioned when I made the reservations, and when we got to the room, they had milk and cookies for us, as well as the most gorgeous gourmet cake with a happy birthday message on it for her and a handwritten note from the manager. The room was amazing, the bathroom (bathtub!) was amazing. Very plush. Great location - easy to walk anywhere (we actually did walk around in the subzero temps), easy to get on the subway. And the front desk staff and concierge were all terrific. This hotel is super family friendly. When you check in, they give the kids a new toy, and they also have a huge jar of M&amp;Ms at the front desk, which my kids helped themselves to more than they should have.We got a good deal, which included a free night's stay as well as a $100 voucher for room service.Highly highly recommended."
11,1455,"Aug 3 2009 	Loews is now one of my favourite hotel brands!	I had a wonderful one-night stay in January en route to Quebec City. After having stayed at the Hotel Vogue in Montreal, and at the Loews in Miami Beach, I can safely say that Loews is now one of my favourite hotel brands - the level of service and accommodation is top-notch!We found an amazing deal on the hotel website -- $229 for a King room including continental room service breakfast for two and valet parking (I did the math, and valet &amp; breakfast on their own would have been over $70). My boyfriend decided not to have the continental breakfast, and simply paid the difference between it and another breakfast option.Pro's:-While quite small, there is a clean and comfortable lobby with a fireplace sitting area and two free internet stations near the concierge desk- Friendly staff throughout the hotel, from guest services, to room service, to the valet attendants- Huge room! Loads of space for storage, tons of room for walking, there was even a separate makeup area with a mirrored counter and stool outside the bathroom- Huge bathroom! Included a separate shower and a jacuzzi tub with a small flat screen TV; overall quite nicely appointed (lots of marble) though it felt a bit 'early 90s'- Great location: Right next to St Catherine, across the street from Ogilvy and down the block from Holt RenfrewCon's:- The only minor complaint is that they forgot turndown service even though it was requested at check-in; we mentioned the error when checking out and they were very apologetic; I also mentioned this in the online customer satisfaction survey that was emailed to me after our stay, and I got a personal email of apology from the hotel (nice touch!)I absolutely would not hestitate to stay here again the next time I am in Montreal, and am just a bit sad that I didn't get to spend more time in our spacious room!"
12,1455,"Aug 2 2009 	Great hotel just a little less in the service department than I would expect from a 5-Star.	Don't get me wrong - this is a phenomenal hotel - the bathrooms alone are the size of some hotel rooms! We had a jacuzzi bathtub, which was great to soak in after a few days of walking everywhere. The robes provided were heavenly and the bedding was incredibly soft! Beware, though - parking is $32/day, but there are in and out privileges. The work out facility is nice, but there is no pool. Also, as another member remarked, you must request turn-down service. I am used to it being provided. Also, there is shoe shine if you leave shoes outside door. Staff was relatively helpful, but I feel we had to wait in line for concierge every time we wanted to talk with her."
13,1455,"Jul 28 2009 	Great Stay at the Vogue	Great rooms, big marble bathroom, ipod docking and all the other amenties that you would expect.But it was the staff that really made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. Thanks to everyone for a fun weekend in Montreal."
14,1455,"Jul 22 2009 	Not Five Stars but seemed to be best in Montreal	This hotel is perfectly fine. It has a good locations, we would have preferred to be in old Montreal but their wasn't a hotel in that area that really met our needs. The hotel has good service except on the night of our arrival the concierge was not there so we had to go by the guidebooks. The hotel has amenities that you would see at a Ritz or a four seasons, from the flat panel TV in the bathroom to the separate shower and bath. So i guess i would put it in the class of standard Ritz's. But this seem to be the nicest hotel in Montreal. Although the Ritz Carlton was still under constructions so we didn't get to see that hotel."
15,1455,"Jul 6 2009 	Superb Hotel Stay	This hotel looked exactly like the photos. It was lovely with many little appointments that made it special- two robes, two hairdryer stations: one in the large bathroom in front of the magnified/lit make up mirror and one at a sweet little make-up area outside the bathroom with a seat and make up lamps. Tip: bring bath salts- they have excellent large jacuzzi tubs with a small flat screen tv in the bathroom that begs for long luxurious bathing. I worried about loud parties on the street because of reviews I'd read but it was absolutely silent in our perfect room (505 - a corner room in the back- king size bed- huge bathroom). The concierge services were great- They recommended restaurants, walking routes and gave maps with easy directions for specific areas we wanted to visit. The restaurant in the hotel- Cellini- was also quite good and very convenient with a good selection of Italian red wines at very affordable prices ($50). We didn't get the turn down service until we requested it. Be sure you do as they provide two bottles of water per night! REally a lovely, gracious hotel- Only improvement to be made is the carpet in our room was tired and stained- rest of the room was perfect."
16,1455,"Jun 11 2009 	this hotel is just ok	I don't get what all the hype surrounding the reviews of this hotel is all about. It is just ok. It is a 5 star hotel with service and accommodations that are good but not excellent. This hotel offers you nothing special and the staff is polite but not overly friendly. Amenities are alright but certainly nothing special as you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The gym facilities are inadequate and they allow you to access a gym facility which is nice, 3 blocks away for a fee of $15 for each workout. They did not give us turn down service at night which is what you would expect at a &quot;classy&quot; hotel. The front desk staff also made a comment that we made our reservations through an on-line company and not directly through the hotel. Not sure what he meant to say but, well..... i'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Honestly if you are looking to stay in a 5 star hotel and want royal treatment with great amenities, i would look into another hotel."
17,1455,"May 10 2009 	Perfect - noise was minimal	A friend and I booked this hotel last minute through hotwire ($130/night all in) and it was absolutely perfect. The room was great - large, well-equipped, clean, and modern. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. The room had small touches that many hotels overlook - full length mirror, great bathrobes, good lighting, plenty of towels, heavy drapes that block out the morning light, an umbrella in the closet, etc. None of these things are particularly luxurious, but they speak to the staff's/management's understanding of hospitality. The hotel is pet-friendly. I brought my dog, and the staff loved him. (The hotel bills itself as the most pet-friendly hotel chain around, so there's a good chance that part of the job is to pretend you like animals even if you don't. But either way, they gave my dog a lot of attention, and didn't bat an eye when he peed on the flower pot right in front of the hotel. They just smiled and washed it off.) The website says it's $25/stay to bring your pet, but they didn't charge us.In addition to indulging my dog, the staff was great for other reasons - just super friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I think the word I'm looking for is &quot;professional.&quot; The concierges were both great too - we took one of their two recommendations for dinner (Mechant Boeuf - very good). I also got a recommendation from a friend for another restaurant (Au Pied de Cochon - outstanding) and the concierge got us in. (It was early - 6PM - but we were still really pleased.)Others have mentioned that noise was a problem. We were on the second floor facing the street, and noise really wasn't an issue. I wore earplugs on Friday night, and slept like a baby. I went earplug-free on Saturday night, and I woke up for a second around 3AM, but didn't have a problem falling back asleep. It really wasn't that loud - perhaps they have replaced the windows? Or maybe it's not an issue on lower floors, because the bars are on the next block over?I spend a lot of time researching hotels before I commit - I feel like half the fun of a vacation is the hotel. (Note: go to [--] to figure out which hotel you are getting through hotwire.) This one didn't disappoint!"
18,1455,May 9 2009 	Great Rooms Amazing staff and a great location	Just returned from a vacation at the Lowes and the hotel is great. The staff goes above and beyond in making you feel welcome and attending to your every need. The rooms are spacious and you sink right into the bed. Loved the bathroom with the oversize Jacuzzi tub. The concierge deserve a special mention as they gave us great recommendations for sightseeing as well as set us up with dinner reservations at some amazing restaurants that they recommended. Montreal is a great city and this hotel is the place to stay.
19,1455,"May 4 2009 	Nice but !!	Just came back from another Great trip to Montreal. What a great city.Loews is in a great location and the rooms and the staff are great overall.My only concerns were--we were in room 702 , very noisy and almost seemed like the windows were open.You can hear every partier on De La Montagne!!The one thing I didn't like was when we booked we took a higher rate as we were getting a food and beverage credit of $100. They don't tell you that you can't use this in the restaurant and is only good for the bar,mini bar or room service.The prices are of course outrageous so in fact you are getting very little for your money. $4.25 plus tax and tip for a can of coke...;Overall, a nice hotel with a great location.Ask for a room not facing De La Montagne..."
20,1455,"Apr 18 2009 	Loews is lovely	We stayed in a Loews hotel in Miami Beach and LOVED it and so we chose this hotel in Montreal and were not at all disappointed. The service was impeccable, rooms wonderfully appointed and location was great for a little shopping. Street noise was our only complaint...we stay in NYC all the time and this definitely rivaled any noise we've ever experienced there. Bar patrons outside to smoke were noisy until the wee hours and reveling students from the nearby university were very loud using this street as a cut-through. We stayed Wed-Sun and while the weekend noise was slightly more intense, it was lous all of the nights. I'm sure requesting a room off of the street would do the trick. We are still very pleased with the Loews chain and would definitely return to any Loews in the future."
21,1455,"Apr 8 2009 	Superb service perfect location - Loews has it all	Most hotels use location as a major incentive, Loews didn't need that. The service was enough.Since we had checked into the hotel late after a long flight, we had been very tired and the clean rooms, quick service and excellent amenities made us feel right at home. The rooms were well sized, with large bathrooms. The hotel interior was not of a very modern design but that's what made gave it more character, in my opinion.The hotel , like others, is a very short walk to the major tourist hotspots and a brief walk away from the tourist information center so that was helpful. The tour operators also do pickups from the hotel, unless there is an event or a festival and the roads are blocked. The hotel is only a block or two away from Crescent street where quite a few of the bars/restaurants are located. The price of the rooms is reasonable, for a 5 star hotel as i think there are other hotels who charge much more for mediocre service. The best part of the hotel was the staff, who were always very courteous, the in-room dining was so good that you didn't feel like going out elsewhere. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quick weekend getaway as well."
22,1455,"Apr 6 2009	It is nice enough for a night	I stayed here recently with my niece who is in college. My expectations were through the roof as the rating is very high in Trip Advisor. The experience was just okay, however. The rooms were clean. The hotel is bright. But the stay was not at all memorable."
23,1455,"Apr 3 2009 	Great Place To Stay In Montreal!	Had 3 fantastic nights at the Vogue on our way to Tremblant at the end of March. Top service and unbeatable location. Rooms are spacious although the carpets are a bit run down. Brilliant bathrooms - loved the jet baths. My only slight complain is that, when we ordered a stretch limo to pick us up from the airport due to the fact that we had a lot of luggage, we were greeted by a driver with a Sedan. After a 20 minute wait, we ended up going to the hotel in two cars... Had we wanted to do that we would have picked up two taxis at the airport which would have cost half the price! The only reason I pre-booked a transfer, was in order to secure a car that would fit all 4 of us and our luggage. Coincidentally, the two Sedans cost the same as what the stretch limo would have cost. That aside, I would certainly return to the Vogue!"
24,1455,"Apr 1 2009 	Vogue Hotel-I heart you	I stayed in this lovely boutique hotel last May (2008)...everything was fabulous from check-in to check-out. Even when we booked the room for this hotel the rate was set to jump $200 for the last 3 nights of our stay and when my dad asked if they could keep the rate the same they were more than happy to oblige.I have been to Montreal quite a bit... started at the Queen Elizabeth and kind of bounced around since then to find the perfect hotel (LOCATION,service, etc)...I dont believe there is any other hotel (except for maybe the one accross the street!) that can beat the location of L'hotel Vogue!! There certainly isn't one that can beat the quality (in my opinion).Myself and 3 of my family members were in Montreal for a concert last May (Kanye West) and I had heard good things about the Vogue, so we decided to give it a try. We booked out one of the suites - I believe it was the &quot;executive suite&quot; - as there were 4 of us (2 in king bed, 2 on king pull-out) and we were very pleased.The layout included a spacious bedroom with a huge beautiful bathroom that had a jacuzi soaker tub and tons of counter space... a powder room-area which connected the bedroom to the living room and as also very very spacious and included a dining area (table for 6+) and a kitchenette/bar area with nice countertops, fridge etc...It was LOVELY..there was also a half bath off the living area with a shower!! The staff greeted us by NAME and were so friendly, even gave us a complimentary movie rental just to show their appreciation... I absolutely loved this place.. I remember that there was internet but I cannot recall whether it was wireless or not...either way , no complaint in that department.....at one point we had a problem with the alarm clock (my dad is technologically challenged) and they sent someone up within 2 minutes to fix it!... very prompt service!rooms were clean.I don't believe there was much of a view but on my top 10 list of things I require my hotel have..the view is on the bottom.When you step outside the doors of the Vogue hotel you are LITERALLY about 10 steps from Ste.Catherine street!! Which is amazing... only about a block from the great restaurant &quot;eggspectation&quot;....speaking of walking out the doors... the doormen were VERY polite, and friendly and always remembered you.I CANNOT WAIT to stay at the Vogue again!If I had to say anything else it would be more of a warning than a complaint - we found that for 4 ppl, although the room had more than enough space, it was a little tight getting everyone showered in the morning (especially with 2 girls aged 18 and 20)...It wasn't a big deal, but as a picky hotel-goer..you might keep this in mind!! Other than that - AMAZING!!"
25,1455,"Mar 14 2009 	One of the nicest places I've stayed	I travel quite a bit, and am always on the lookout for upper-range hotels with good prices. This is definitely one of those places. Nice location central to downtown Montreal &amp; close to subway, great restaurants nearby. Hotel room was great, booked a junior suite which had a huge bathroom, two flat screens and nice comfortable bed, though could have gotten a standard room and been just as happy. Great laundry service and lots of nice little amenities--for example, cold, fresh-squeezed lemonade in the reception area on hot afternoons. Very helpful &amp; professional staff willing to help out w/reservations for dinner. Nice lounge for people-watching as well. Not a cheap place to stay, but in this instance you get what you pay for &amp; more."
26,1455,"Feb 23 2009 	Very very nice	Stayed one night at the Loews Hotel Vogue in early January for touring Montreal. The location is great if you're all about shopping, but not ideal if you're looking to tour Old Montreal. The hotel itself, though, was just terrific. Small enough that the staff, which never seemed to number more than a handful, were able to respond immediately to any question or concern that arose. The rooms were great, and the bathrooms spectacular. Legitimate 5-star accommodations. Loews' gimmick is having surprises for kids who stay, and for our teenagers it was an envelope -- with their names on them -- with a card for some free mp3 downloads. A very cool move. The kids loved the place, as did my wife and I. I'd have no hesitation recommending this to anyone, ever."
27,1455,"Feb 9 2009 	Enjoyed our stay here very much	3 nite stay at the lowes montreal, great room, wonderful bath, w/big(although usless jetted)tub, and separate shower. Fell in love with the city of Montreal. Well maintained, clean, beautiful public streets, flowers planted everywhere. The room overlooked a cute, but unused courtyard. Everyone was nice and friendly. Plus, with lowes first membership level, I get a 100$ food and bev credit, in addition to the 50$per nite credit i got with booking the room. The room was slightly more than most other hotel rooms in the city that weekend, but the accomodations were above average, and with my bonus bucks, thought it was an overall good deal."
28,1455,"Jan 31 2009	Fantastic	Great location, nice hotelThis hotel is perfect as a base to visit Montreal. Nice big room , a so comfortable bed, a great and clean bathroom. The staff was very helpful giving directions and more advice on local restaurants and must see. Definitely a good choice."
29,1455,"Dec 23 2008 	Great Find	Great service. The front door staff, the receptionists, the concierge, the room service were all very friendly and polite. Our room was incredible and we loved the marble bath. The bathroom was in fact, enormous. We were there in the dead of winter, but having a great hotel and hotel room to come back to made our trip absolutely enjoyable. Would stay there again in a heartbeat-- but pehaps wait till it wasn't freezing in Montreal."
30,1455,"Oct 30 2008 	Loved it!	I love this hotel! Every year my wife and I take a trip to Montreal to enjoy the Jazz Festival. We've been going for 5 years and have stayed at the Vogue 3 years in a row. The service is second to none and the location is great, even if the jazz festival is on the other side of Downtown. We always seem to spend a little too much money at Ogilvy's, but I guess it's all part of the &quot;Montreal experience&quot;.Can't wait for next year!"
31,1455,Oct 27 2008 	WOW- STAY HERE!	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in February and was very very impressed. I travel to Montreal for business quite often but this is by far my favorite hotel in the city.The service is great and the hotel is in a prime location.But the piece de resistance had to be the bathrooms.... very luxurious with plazma tvs and jacuzzis. The room was large and very vrey comfortable.Highly recommend.
32,1455,"Oct 4 2008 	THE BEST!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel over the Labour Day weekend and I can't say enough! We were looking for a hotel where we could take our dogs with us (our canine kids!), but we didn't want to lose the luxury. We have a smaller mixed breed and a St. Bernard, which can make it difficult to find a posher hotel. Did we ever find the best! We couldn't believe how welcoming and friendly everyine was, from the time we called the hotel to enquire to time we left! The rooms are a great size, with big windows and a big fluffy bed. The bathroom is the topper though. I almost wanted to spend the whole weekend soaking in the big jacuzzi tub watching the flatscreen tv mounted on the counter of the massive bathroom! Gorgeous! Every member of the staff that we met were so helpful and friendly. A pet bed and bowls were provided for our dogs on the first night with a smile. We picked this hotel because we could travel with our pets, but I will return if I'm travelling with or without them! Loved it, loved it loved it!"
33,1455,"Sep 27 2008 	A lot to like about the Hotel Vogue	We booked on Five Star Alliance. This was a great thing because the deal included free internet--otherwise $14.95/day for in room internet. Surprisingly for a top rated hotel, our first room had a dirty carpet. We asked for and received a room change the next day and staff moved our things. Ask for an upper floor. Great location, very friendly and helpful staff, stylish, super bathrooms."
34,1455,"Sep 12 2008 	Nice little Hotel	Just returned from a couple of weeks in eastern Canada. Started at Loews Hotel Vogue. Found the hotel extremely comfortable and clean. Current decor appealing. Good lighting in bathroom and bedroom. Liked extras...TV in bathroom, magnifying makeup /shaving mirror. Extra mirrored &quot;station&quot; outside the bathroom for second person. Pretty bathrooms with spacious marble topped vanity. Had an air of elegance. Room service food very good. Felt like fine dining out!We purchased the parking/breakfast package.Concierge was extremely personable and helpful.Though our room was &quot;non-smoking&quot; it smelled like smoke upon our arrival. Quickly an attendant was sent to open windows and air room out...also remarking that they have a recirculating system to clear the air many times an hour. Soon the smell disappeared.They can't control what goes on behind closed doors!We were delighted with this choice. Great way to begin our trip."
35,1455,"Aug 25 2008 	if you are looking for the perfect get away!	What a wonderfu, friendly and beautiful botique hotel right in the middle of Montreal's shopping district and nearby McGill Univ.The only negative thing to mention about the hotel is the carpeting in our room definitely needs to be replaced!The staff, service, etc. are all excellent. Leave your car at home or if you drive, park it in the garage. You are in walking distance of everything. You will need to take a cab to old Montreal. So much to see and do there too. A very safe city to walk around.Montreal is very very expensive due to the low value of the US dollar, but it was still worth the tri"
36,1455,Aug 17 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed here for 2 nights. Large Spacious room and good service located right in the center of Montreal. Highly Recomended
37,1455,"Aug 6 2008 	Beautiful hotel great location	Stayed here for a weekend getaway with my husband. Its in a nice location in the city, near rue St. Catherine which is lined with shops. We had a premium king room which was decorated in a modern style. At one end of the room near the TV you had a nice seating area. The bathroom was large, with all black marble, a jacuzzi tub and separate shower."
38,1455,"Jul 8 2008 	Everything was perfect	Although we could have found a better hotel rate in Montreal for JazzFest, we chose the Vogue based upon location and other reviews. We were extremely pleased. The staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel was immaculate, and our room was lovely and comfortable. We sprung for the premium room at a modest additional expense, and found it to be perfect for us. It had a small foyer as you entered, a well-appointed and large marble bathroom, and an attractive bedroom with a comfortable bed and top notch linens. The coffee machine was a Kreurig model, dispensing a premium cup at a time. The hotel is located in a nice neighborhood with several good French bistros within a few blocks, the fine art museum two blocks away, and within a 15 minute walk or 2 metro stops to the JazzFest itself. On our departure day they were very willing to allow us a 3 pm late checkout. We were completely pleased with our stay."
39,1455,"Jul 6 2008 	Loews Does Not Disappoint. Excellent!	Stayed a night at Loews Hotel Vogue while on the way to Tremblant. Loved it so much we spent another night on the way back from Tremblant! And, we booked into the Vogue for our trip to Montreal later this month. So within a month we will have stayed at the Vogue three times. That's how much we love this hotel.What's so great?The location is great (well, not if you just want Old Montreal stuff. For that, I'd recommend the Gault). But for this part of town, and Mont Royal, this is wonderful.Facilities very well maintained. Rooms are spacious and spotless. Lobby is inviting.Our room had a jetted tub, and separate shower. Bathroom was very large. Room was also large. TV in bathroom. VCR/DVD in room. Three phones.Nice welcoming amenities for Loews First members.Everybody we encountered: doorman, bell staff, front desk, housekeeper, restaurant people. ALL courteous and professional.We returned three days later, and the doorman recognized us and greeted us by name! Nice touch!The service attitude at this hotel is really superb. Others should find out how they have such great service and learn from them.This is not the cheapest hotel around, even in its class, but for what it gives us in service, we just love it here (again, unless we are visiting Old Montreal).Had lunch at the Cellini, the hotel restaurant. Good prices and good quality, and very friendly staff. Would recommend.Concierge contacted us way before our arrival and asked for age of our kids. They prepared a nice welcoming gift for them as well. Nice touch.We asked the concierge (by email) to help us make dinner reservations. Quick and accurate. Very prompt and courteous service.We will be back!"
40,1455,"Jun 20 2008 	Good Stay at the Vogue	We stayed here for part two of our honeymoon and found this to be a perfectly nice hotel. It was great for a city location, had nice staff, was very clean and we had a nice big room. This is not a historic hotel, so the ambiance is newer. But the hotel in reality was what we expected from the Web site when we booked.They were very nice and had chocolate covered strawberries for us when we arrived, very sweet. We had some really good room service and the hotel restaurant was really good. We were able to sightsee from this hotel very easily and it's in a nice shopping area. Overall, no complaints. Your basic, nice hotel!"
41,1455,"Jun 10 2008 	We loved it	We Had 4 nights at the Vouge.Found the staff very freindly and helpfull.A great location and easy to get around.Do your self a favour and get a bath pillow, ( I found one at the BS on St Catherine). Made the spa that much more enjoyable especially after walking to the top of Mount Royal.Note: if you walk from the hotel to the top of Mount Royal, allow 2hrs return. Room service was great, can't comment on the restauarant as we never ate there.Loved this Hotel and thanks again Trip Advisor"
42,1455,"Jun 2 2008 	Fantastic short break hotel	Stayed at the Loews for 3 nights and really can not fault it. We (2 adults) are from London, UK and after seeing Toronto we chose The Loews Hotel Vogue following TripAdvisor recommendations before going onto Vancouver for the rest of our vacation.We found the Loews location very convenient. Short walk to the main shopping street and about a 15-20 min stroll to old Montreal which for us given the spring like weather was lovely. Hotel staff could not have been more helpful, coffee/mini bar replenished every day, turn down service and we were on a regular room rate booked via TripAdvisor hotel check rates. Now we have arrived home we wished that we had spent less time in Toronto and more time in Montreal. However they say a good city always leaves you wanting more!"
43,1455,"May 29 2008 	Not a bad choice if you're able to book a good rate.	We've stayed here for 7 nights and were able to get a good deal through the hotel website. If we had paid more, I probably wouldn't have given it this rating.The hotel is conveniently located right in the middle of the centre on a relatively quiet side street of the busy Rue de Ste. Catherine. The lobby looks beautiful but is quite small. Everytime you enter and leave the hotel a nice door man opens the door for you. That does give a bit of a 5-star feeling which this hotel is supposed to be.The room itself wasn't anything special. Decor from the late 80's with a matching TV (volume went up and down for no reason), a view of the hotel right across the street, no seating area with a table, besides the working desk which isn't quite suitable for having dinner in your room. The bathroom was quite big, modern and very clean though. The beds were quite good! Matresses not too firm or too soft. The minibar hasn't been restocked once during our entire stay, not even after we've left the minibar key in the room. The coffee cups though were replenished after we did that, so perhaps that's a tip for future visitors. :-)The hotel bar is incredibly small and not much fun. The restaurant is very expensive so we didn't eat there. Room service is nothing special; the usual stuff you'd expect staying at a hotel of this caliber, with prices to match.Staff is extremely friendly, sometimes a bit too much if you ask me. It felt somewhat phoney a couple of times.If you're a member of their Loews First Program and you've selected the $10 minibar credit as the gift, check your bill! The ''gift'' wasn't deducted from our bill but we didn't see that until we were well on our way to the airport.All in all not bad at all, but not really 5 stars either. The good deal on the room rate made up for all of the flaws, but thats it basically."
44,1455,"May 27 2008 	Great Service Fantastic Location Needs a Few Updates...	I just returned from the Loews Hotel Vogue in Montreal. It was my first trip to this fantastic city, and the Vogue is in a very good location for easy access to many of the best restaurants, shops, and Mont Royal. Old Montreal and other areas are just a quick cab ride away.I have to give the Vogue a 5-star rating regarding service...friendly, helpful, and a great welcome to the city. Other than the location, other positives were the very attentive bell staff and doormen, a top-notch bartender in the lounge, and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever experienced! What keeps me from giving it an overall 5-star rating is that the decor was a bit dated (bathroom in particular, though the size was excellent) and the hotel does not have wireless internet (in 2008!). Apparently they're working on it, but the wireless signal I was picking up in the lobby was from the hotel across the street. I could've given them a little slack on that, but not when I found out that the plug-in internet access at the desk in my room was $15/day. I really enjoyed the Vogue and felt the $250/night was pretty reasonable on a busy and gorgeous weekend, though after walking around the city and seeing some of the other choices, I'd likely give the Sofitel or W (or one of a few other highly-rated hotels I've seen here on TripAdvisor) a try the next time around."
45,1455,"May 23 2008 	Outstanding Hotel	Had a fantastic time at this hotel - staff were great and could not do enough for me and my girlfriend - who had only just broken her leg at Mont Tremblant and had spent the last 3-4 days in Montreal General Hospital.Reception staff were great. We had reserved one of the suites which was well worth it. Room Service was out of this world too - pure gluttony!It was a lot of money for us, but it was worth any penny and would do it again in a heart beat.For a holiday that started so well on the slopes, included a very sore and traumatic middle because of the leg, it ended sweetly with our stay here."
46,1455,"May 18 2008 	No complaints here!	We stayed for a week in a suite and it was perfect. Great hotel service... good decor.. personal touches..big rooms... room service good, not great...on site restaurant nothing that memorable.. friendly and helpful concierge.. great two marble bathrooms... would definitely recommend..downside: internet access can be reached at the two computers in the lobby but if not you have to pay $14.95 for WiFi a day.."
47,1455,"May 16 2008 	Good but not 5 star	We have just returned from a week in Loews Vogue. Maybe this hotel is 5 star for Canadian standards but the room was a bit small and the TV set right from the 90's. The minibar was not refilled for the entire stay, same for the coffeecups. Asking twice for a refill which took more than 45 minutes. Business centre had only 2 computers with very slow internet. Although I enjoyed my stay, Loews did't gave my a 5 star feeling."
48,1455,"May 15 2008 	Wonderful experience at Loews Hotel Vogue	To celebrate our birthdays, I took my mom to Montreal. We stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue and were incredibly impressed. The hotel has an antique-ish vibe, but all of the rooms are well sized, nicely appointed, very clean and well kept. I had a corner room with an adjoining living space. My mom and I stayed in the bedroom and my brother slept on the pull-out sofa on the living room side. Because I am a member of their rewards program, I received a complimentary local gift upon arrival. (I highly recommend that you sign up for their free rewards program in advance of your stay to take advantage of some of their benefits.) I'm a person who makes hotel decisions based on the look of the bathroom and I definitely made the right decision. The bathrooms are fantastic! It was almost as large as the bedroom with a vanity area and separate shower stall, but the best part is the tub. I travel quite frequently for work, and I can honestly say that it was the largest jacuzzi tub I've ever seen in a hotel. Though I never used it, my mom and brother raved about it. They'd never been to Montreal before, but felt that the jacuzzi tub made it all worthwhile! I can't say enough about the place. The prices were reasonable and the rooms were great, plus the hotel is centrally located less than a block away from St. Catherine - one of the major shopping destinations in the city. The only &quot;slightly&quot; down-side was the hotel restaurant. While the food was enjoyable, the prices were abit high. All told, I highly recommend staying at this hotel."
49,1455,"May 2 2008 	Only thing more you could ask for would be free Wi-Fi in rooms	The location is great, the staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are tastefully and well-appointed, etc. My only peeve is that they think they can get away with charging $14.95/day for wired internet. Don't they realize this is 2008? The Hotel de la Montagne next door has free Wi-Fi."
50,1455,Apr 23 2008 	Luxery room excellent service and delicious food	I stayed at Hotel Vogue for a shopping weekend in Montreal and it did not disappoint. From the lobby to my room itself it is probably the nicest and most luxurious hotels I've stayed in. The bathroom was a dream equipped with tv and jacuzzi tub. The service was excellent when the moment I stepped in. Everyone was very friendly and polite. I ordered room service for dinner and the food was delicious. shopping is just steps away which is great. nice to have a dvd in the room too. For a luxury shopping weekend in Montreal or a romantic getaway I would definitely recommend Hotel Vogue.
51,1455,Apr 18 2008 	Our Favorite in Montreal!	My husband and I take quick over night trips to Montreal and this is our very favorite Hotel. You are right off Ste. Catherine and all the wondrful shopping and with walking distance to some yummy french bistros!The beds are like heaven. From the time you arrive you are treated as if you are really wanted there. I love this hotel!!!!
52,1455,"Apr 16 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	THE place to stay if you want to be near the action with great accomodations. Walking distance to Center Bell, Crescent St., St. Catherine's, and churches. Rooms were comfortable and tidy. Beware the mini-bar- it's one that charges as soon as you move an item. Service was great as was bar and restaurant staff. Complimentary internet in lobby. Flat screen in bathrooms unique touch. Great overall experience!!!"
53,1455,"Apr 8 2008 	Everything I hoped for and more	Two of us stayed from April1-4th at this hotel and it was wonderful. Can't say enough about their service. Concierge was fabulous and really helped us newcomers to Montreal. The hotel itself has an incredible location close to McGill and lots of shopping. Old Montreal would be about a 40 minute walk.The room great with luxury bedding and lots of room. The bathroom, as you've seen in pictures on this site, was incredible. Huge bathroom with jacuzzi tub and flat screen tv for watching as you soak. There is a seprate shower. The bathrobes are a nice touch when you are away.Turn down service every night made things even more special.I've stayed at alot of hotels with my work and this really had some of the best service that I have received."
54,1455,"Apr 6 2008 	Loews Vogue - Still in Vogue!	The Loews Vogue is a classic, smaller luxury hotel in downtown Montreal. My family (2 adults, kids aged 18,15,12) stayed there March 23-28, 2008. The purpose of the trip was to explore the largest French speaking city outside of Paris - and to overcome the inability to acquire travel to someplace south!The rooms - adjoining for us - were not large but comfortable and luxurious. Large bathrooms, comfotable beds and decor, with DVD players etc...What I really enjoyed was the quality of the service. The concierges were fantastic and could not do enough for us. They helped with many questions and offered wonderful suggestions for dinner or even how to experience museums.We had breakfast each day in the restaraunt and Gerard took wonderful care of us. He took an interest in our family, offered ideas and even had small gifts for the kids - all hockey fans - the day we left. The food - breakfast only for us - was very good at the Hotel.The lobby bar was a bit overpriced for the one drink we had there.Would highly recommend this hotel - and my wife and I would certainly return - alone!"
55,1455,"Apr 6 2008 	Overrated	You get what you expect w/ a 4 star hotel; namely friendly service (they recommended good places to eat and watch the Canadiens game) and a clean room. You also get a good location if you would like to spend time in the &quot;Anglo&quot; area of Montreal. However, you also get the worst of the chain hotel experience. Namely a knife in the back, or in this case wallet, every step of the way. 30$ daily for parking and 6.50$ for the bottle of water they leave in the room. I find both over the top. Particularly the water. In addition I stupidly forgot my cell phone charger in the room and when I called the next day to see if they could mail to me they did not have it. So the cleaning staff either took it (not sure why they would do that) or else lazily threw it in the garbage. Guess it doesn't really matter since they would have probably charged me the cost of buying a new one to mail it."
56,1455,"Apr 1 2008 	Beautiful hotel with great service	First of all, thank you to the Trip Advisor contributors. We booked this hotel after reading the reviews and couldn't have been happier. My husband, I and our three pre-teen to teenaged kids loved our weekend stay in Montreal at Loew's. This is a beautiful, centrally located hotel with fabulous service; the combination of posh decor and top-notch staff can't be beat. The car valets, doormen and front desk staff were all very friendly; the kids loved the huge jars of M &amp; M's with scoops at the front desk; they were each also presented with a personalized note and a voucher for a free in-room movie during our stay - they truly felt welcomed here. Our quiet, clean connecting rooms featured two doubles connecting to a queen bed with a canopy which worked perfectly for us. Though a bit on the small side as has been mentioned, these are gorgeous rooms with high ceilings and well-thought-out amenities - flat screen TV, comfortable bed with a crisp white duvet, minibar, coffee maker with take-out cups and lids, desk, closet with safe, etc. - so the size was certainly not a problem. The only negative was our view of the roof of the next building. If I get the chance to visit again, I would request a street view. The bathrooms are fantastic -- large, marble everywhere, jacuzzi tub, separate shower, plenty of counter space, two hair dryers (one in the bathroom, one outside it at the small vanity area), nice toiletries and another flat-screen TV viewable from the tub.We enjoyed a drink at the lobby bar in the evenings while the kids watched their free movies - again impeccable service. Loew's is in the midst of downtown dining and shopping including the large underground, out-of-the-weather shopping areas (entrance 3 blocks away). The concierge recommended two good restaurants also within walking distance: Le Taj for Indian food (small portions but very tasty - great naan) and Le Pois Penche for upscale French bistro fare (great service and ambience) and both welcomed the kids. Egg Spectations for brunch which is just a block or so away is not to be missed. (The Italian restaurant on the premises looked good but we did not eat there.) We also were a quick walk away from the Musee des Beaux-Arts and took in the fine Cuban Art expedition.We really couldn't ask for more and would definitely stay here again!"
57,1455,"Mar 27 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	Recently returned from a weekend trip to Montreal to see the Bruins/Canadiens game in which we stayed at the Loews Hotel. The hotel was situated perfectly for us due to the fact we wanted to be close to St. Catherines Street and the Bell Centre. The room was spacious, clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was extremely large with a Jacuzzi tub and stand up shower. The small flat screen tv also in the bathroom was a great amenity. Getting back to location, the hotel is a stones throw from St. Catherines, Peel and Crescent Streets. Which means you are close to all the shops, bars and clubs. Another nice option was the 24 hr room service. After a night of drinking on Crescent Street we needed something in our stomachs and ordered some food. They took no more than 10 minutes to deliver it up to us. The staff is polite and courteous and the concierge was extremely helpful in helping us find restaurants and booking reservations. I have stayed at a few other hotels in Montreal including both Marriotts and my Loews experience has been far better than the others. I would stay at no other location. Montreal is a great city with a European feel. Everyone is very trendy and extremely polite. As Bruins fans, we were not even harassed at the game, well maybe a few boos when I was cheering when the Bs scored. Though, I love the city and again I would stay no other place than Loews."
58,1455,"Mar 10 2008 	Fabulous family stay	Spent a lovely weekend at Loews Hotel Vogue - during a major Montreal blizzard - with my husband and two teenagers. Booked the Junior Suite and it was perfect for four - 2 good sized rooms (Bedroom and living room) with 2 full baths. The hotel provided a rollaway as well. Immaculate, quiet and great housekeeping services. The staff, from the concierge to the bellman to the bartender to the front desk people, were all wonderful. We sipped hot chocolate in front of a roaring fire in the lobby while the snow fell and the wind blew in 50mph gusts down the street in front of the hotel. Great location for shopping, restaurants and sightseeing, all of which we managed to do, despite the snow. Vieux Montreal was lovely. Ogilvy, right across the street from the hotel, is a truly fantastic department store. We would definitely stay at another Loews hotel after this experience."
59,1455,"Mar 6 2008	AMAZING...will never stay anywhere else!	My friend and I decided to go an a mini &quot;girl getaway&quot; to Montreal. We spent a lot of time researching and looking for the right hotel. After reading several reviews and browsing pictures, we had decided on Loews Hotel. We got a very good deal on Travelzoo, GREAT deal!!!We stayed in a Premium room which had an all marble bathroom (huge) with a flat screen TV in the bathroom. The room was VERY spacious and had THE most comfortable beds. And they were VERY clean.Our car was valeted upon arrival. Our bags were taken straight to our rooms, while we checked in. The staff was always smiling and pleasant. When calling down to front desk they always addressed you by name and were very helpful.The location was fantastic. Right on the corner of Rue de la Montagne and St. Catherines. Very close to EVERYTHING. That was our main concern when searching for a place to stay. We wanted to be in the center of it all.....and we were!Every room has an iHome, but please be warned that it is only built for an iPod NANO. And parking was quite expensive ($30 per night). The mini fridge was stocked always, but again, just like anywhere else, it was expensive. Expect to pay $6.50 for a bottle of water. :SI cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions!P.S. If you log onto the hotel website and sign on to their &quot;FIRST LOEWS&quot;, you have a choice of gift to your room upon arrival. We requested a bottle of red wine. Do yourselves a favour and order something else! LOL"
60,1455,"Feb 11 2008 	Great for couples!	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel in January for a weekend getaway- and we loved it! We felt like we were staying somewhere really special with this one. Our room had a beautiful (and comfortable) canopy bed and an enormous bathroom with its own television, shower, and separate jetted bathtub. There was also a vanity mirror in the hallway connecting the door and the room. The room was very large and extremely beautiful. The hotel staff was so friendly, and we ended up talking with the bell boy for quite a while. The location, right near St. Catharine on Rue LaMontagne, is great for tourists because of the plethora of bars and restaurants that are located just a block away on Crescent Street. We very much enjoyed this weekend getaway, and would stay at Loews again!"
61,1455,"Jan 15 2008 	Great for a quick weekend getaway!	I stayed at this hotel just for a weekend, but I wish that I could have stayed longer - its fantastic from start to finish! After a quick cab ride from the airport, check in was very efficient and the staff were very pleasant and aiming to please. Before you go, sign up for the Loews First frequent guest program on the company's website and you get a choice of a &quot;welcome gift&quot; every time you stay at a Loews property (I chose red wine and mixed nuts - a nice pick-me-up before dinner!). The room (a jr. suite) was beautiful with a canopy queen sized bed, lighted make-up vanity outside the bathroom and a fantastic marble bathroom with seperate shower, jacuzzi and TV. Rooms are serviced twice a day and the turn donw service is a treat. I didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food, but the lobby bar is a great place for a martini and some great people watching! The location of the property is very convenient. I was attending a hockey game at the Bell Centre, only a 5 min. walk away. Rue St. Catherine and Rue Crescent are right nearby and have lots of options for bars, restaurants and shopping. I will definetly choose this hotel when I am in Montreal again - it was stylish and serene with great service."
62,1455,"Jan 14 2008	Unique and upscale	This boutique hotel in the heart of Montreal was ideally located. Head one way and you're at the St Lawrence; the other way and you're at Mount Royal, a great place to walk.The room was comfortable; the jet tub in the bathroom a much welcomed relief after all of the walking we did in Mount Royal.This is considered a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel - which from my experience is an older property that's made some upgrades but none too extensive. The highlights: Francine at the L'Opera Bar, a small lounge near the hotel's elevators. Francine was friendly and accommodating and remembered what we drank every visit."
63,1455,"Jan 3 2008	Very good.	Excellent! A solid 4 star. No other 4 star compares including the Fairmont, Chateau Champlain, etc...My only complaint is that the barmaid in the lobby says &quot;tu&quot; instead of &quot;vous&quot; which I think is disrespectful."
64,1455,"Jan 2 2008 	Do not even look at any other hotel...	Hands down, this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Do not even bother staying in any other hotel in Montreal. I am serious. It is absolutely stunning. First and foremost, I felt like ROYALTY. From the moment you pull up on the curb to the time you leave, everything is pretty much done for you. By the time we reached the counter to check in, our bags were on our way to our room and they even knew our name before we could say it! The room was the most spacious hotel room that I have ever seen. The bed was SO comfy. The bathroom is the size of my bedroom at home! Flat screen TVS and phone in bathroom. Concierge service - Take advantage! Couldn't be nicer....Do not stay in any other hotel in Montreal.This has to be THE best!"
65,1455,"Dec 27 2007 	Unbeatable...Absolutely Spectacular!	Loews Hotel Vogue is a Gem!My most recent stay was flawless from check in to check out.The hotel itself is very beautiful.The location is unbeatable. Loews is easily accessed from both the train and bus station as well as the airport. The local metro is also close by.The lobby is warm and cozy.There are always little treats and current newspapers available.The internet access is a great feature, very convenient for checking your email etc...The staff are all very friendly and informative.They are extremely knowlegable and are eager to answer any questions you may have.The rooms are a perfect size.They offer plenty of space for all kinds of luggage, shopping bags and so on.There is a well sized entry to the room, closet, vanity and workspace.The beds are very comfortable, and the sheets are divine!The nightly turn down service is lovely.The bathroom is gorgeous, and huge I might add.They are very clean with plenty of amenities.The jet tub is like an oasis after a long day of shopping.The flat screen t.v. is a nice touch.There is great sized shower, with good water temperature and pressure.Loews offers a wide variety of guest services.Reading the long list really confirms that they have your best interest in mind.They offer services that would benefit all types of travellers. Whether it be a business traveller, a couple or a family.Judging from the list they have anticiapted your every need and desire.I have stayed at multiple hotels in Montreal and a fare share of others across the globe and Loews stands tall everytime!Lowes is by far my favorite hotel in Montreal, I would never consider staying anywhere else."
66,1455,"Dec 16 2007 	Awesome Stay...Again!	What a great hotel in a wonderful location. We have stayed here many times over the past few years and have never been disappointed. The rooms are spacious and VERY quiet and the bathroom has a separate walk-in shower. Everything is spotless and the service (from the front desk to room service to the doorman and valet) is top notch. We return to find the same friendly faces working in this hotel, which definitely says something about the way Loews treats their employees. We can't wait to go back! Superb..."
67,1455,"Dec 6 2007 	Bijou of a hotel in the centre of a lovely city	This is a plush, small, romantic and luxury boutique hotel in downtown Montreal, just minutes walk from the best shops and restaurants. I've stayed here twice this year during seperate months and enjoyed it both times.I recommend room 911, with a four poster double bed, large work desk, spacious marbel bathroom with jacuzzi bath. This is one of the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. The staff here are helpful, too. I left a pair of shoes in the room and they mailed them to my address in Toronto straight away.I saved a lot by booking my room here on the Five Star Alliance website and got free internet access, which is normally an extra charge."
68,1455,"Nov 30 2007	High marks to the Lowes	This is a lovely, well-appointed, centrally located, and cozy place to stay in what I find to be the most convenient part of Montreal. We've stayed here twice, both times in November, and look forward to our next visit. I find it a more charming and interesting space than the Queen Elizabeth; it is certainly much, much smaller in terms of the number of rooms. The kids thought the TV in the bathroom was a hilarious concept (but they want one in ours now too)."
69,1455,"Nov 19 2007 	Great hotel for kids!	I absolutely love this hotel. I have stayed here twice in the last few months (once with my husband and once with my mom) and I won't even consider staying anywhere else for future trips to Montreal.The hotel is gorgeous and the staff go out of their way to ensure that guests have a comfortable and enjoyable stay.The rooms are so comfortable with plush pillows, duvets and nice sheets. The whirlpool with the flat screen tv is also great for relaxing after a day of shopping and walking around.Valet parking is $30 which is on the higher end for Montreal - hotels seem to range from $20-30 but I know my car is safe in a private underground parkade.The restaurant isn't very good and I don't recommend eating there. We didn't eat there this last visit but I ate there in August when I was traveling with my husband and my infant daughter because it was pouring and we didn't want to leave the hotel. Our dinner was $150 and we only had one drink each. My husband had a steak and there were so many cuts in it, (to check if it was cooked) it looked like something that came off of dad's bbq, not something you'd expect in a restaurant. I have to give credit to the service though and the waiter brought plain pasta for my daughter at no charge.The hotel staff also provided exceptional service. Their slogan 'Loews loves kids' holds true as they have a contract with Fisher Price so you can borrow toys during your stay. I requested a couple of toys when we arrived and when we returned to our room there was a potty. I have a one year old and I did not want her playing with a potty! I called the front desk and one of the staffers returned to our room 3 times with different toys (a push toy, a xylophone and another musical toy.)Loews is in an excellent location between St.Catharine and Sherbrooke. I love this hotel and I highly recommend it!"
70,1455,"Nov 11 2007 	Hotel Vogue - You Really Got Me!	Visited Montreal to attend the Van Halen concert at the Bell Center and selected this hotel due to the great reviews of other tripadvisor members. This hotel was outstanding! From the front desk that treated us as though we were their favorite customer, to the fabulously huge bathroom, to the comfortable bed, to the terrific location for attending the event and for sightseeing the next day, we were thrilled. I need to hurry up and find a reason to go back!"
71,1455,"Nov 11 2007 	Potentially great boutique hotel but...	This is a potentially great boutique hotel - great rooms, excellent staff, very comfortable BUT I resent having to pay extra for water and internet which other comparable hotels (The Nelligan, Le Germain) throw in. It just feels like I'm being nickled and dimed to death. Other posters have made the same comments and I'm hoping that Le Vogue is listening - I'm heading back there tonight.Otherwise it's a terrific hotel in a great location whether you're in Montreal for business or pleasure."
72,1455,"Oct 30 2007 	Great Hotel	Great hotel! In a great location! Had meetings in the hotel, great facility for this! Stayed Oct. 25-28.Again location was great, close to shopping, night clubs, and the underground. On-stie restaurant was good, the bar in the lobby is packed at night. Easy check-in, very friendly staff, secure hotel, business center is convenient free use of computer and printing, in-room internet is $15 per day.Rooms were large, bed was comfy, bathroom large (shower could stand for an update). ipod alarm clock in room was nice. No complaints and would stay here again.Other restaurants that were not too far and food was great - Version, Newton, Primadonna."
73,1455,"Oct 20 2007 	quick trip to Montreal	My girlfriend and I went to Montreal recently. She mainly went for the shopping and I went for the food.The hotel was great for shopping as it is just off Rue St. Catherine's. We were within walking distance of several malls such as Eaton Center and Montreal Trust building. The Holt Renfrew Department store was really nice and in addition, the hotel was directly across the street to Ogilvy's Department store.I will review the restaurants separately. The hotel restaurant was excellent. The concierge was great with suggestions and help with reservations. We were lucky to be upgraded to a very nice suite but the regular room with a king bed seemed very comfortable. The only problem was the construction outside which led to some noise during the working hours. We totally loved Montreal and would like to come back."
74,1455,"Oct 14 2007	Generally fine experience but a couple of sour notes	Spent 3 nights at the Hotel Vogue, chosen on basis of strong TripAdvisor reviews. Rooms are large, comfortable, and very attractive. Bathroom was huge and very nicely appointed. Staff were friendly, helpful, and professional, a very nice mix. I particularly commend the doormen.I paid $242/night (+ $40 in taxes), which is the AAA rate. When the US dollar is strong this hotel is a bargain, at parity we are approaching NYC rates.My quibbles are that at this rate I would expect internet access in rooms to be free (not $15 to use a wire; wireless in the lobby is through a vendor that seems to want you to buy minutes--I relied on my Blackberry, instead, and the free computers in the lobby). Those loby computers, complete with free printing, are a nice touch.There is a breakfast buffet laid out in the restaurant--$16 or so for fruit, cereal, juice, coffee, coldcuts, cheese, and yogurt. Not bad, not generous.OK, here's a pet peeve others may not share: I strongly resent the bottle of water in the room that costs $6.50. Yes, I know, by know most experienced travelers have seen this trap. But it seems wrong for hotels to lay traps for &quot;guest&quot;--$6.50 for the bottle, and the have the snotty temerity to add &quot;Enjoy!&quot; to the label. More fundamentally, these days we are all subject to incredible demands on our attention--airports, airplance, hotel rooms all full of ads and commercials. In the room we really deserve a little TLC, which would in this instance translate into not having to read every label to know what peril lies within.As for the minibar, which I think had some device that would indicate if it had been opened, let alone accessed...you would not find my fingerprints on that one.Here's a tip: If you head down Ste Catherine and turn left on St. Denis--about a mile walk or a couple of metro stops--a few doors up the street and on your right you will encounter Juliette au Chocolat, a shop that serves truly extraordinary chocolat in almost every imaginable form. I am not given to hyperbole, I think:: your cup of hot chocolate may be white, milk, semi-sweet or several grades of dark (with cocoa %s given), served in the classic or &quot;ancienne&quot; (Grandma's) style--with a few fair trade options to salve the conscience.. There are also chocolates to take home, chocolate brownies, fondue, crepes, etc. So, enjoy Loew's, and consider a stop at Juliette's if you enjoy fine chocolate on a cool day. Oh, I understand the lines can be lone at night, so try afternoon to avoid disappointment.Bon appetit!"
75,1455,"Oct 6 2007 	The Gold Standard of Boutique Hotels	I travel to Montreal on business 2-3 times a year. I have tried a couple of other hotels just for diversity, but there is no reason to stay anywhere else in this city. Here's why:Location: Un the heart of downtown, near shopping with easy access to expressways that can get you anywhere within minutesI have stayed at some of the boutique hotels near Old Montreal, but I find that location a bit isolated. Rooms. The rooms are always nice, but on this last visit I had a room that somehow seemed bigger and recently renovated. It was beautiful and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom. The bed is extremely comfortable and the linens are top-notch.Value: The overall experience is 5 star without question at 4 star prices. That does not happen too often in today's world.Service. The highest standard I have ever seen. Everyone addresses you by name. They can't do enough for you. The room service is the fastest I have ever had, and very good. The small bar is really warm and friendly and always busy at cocktail hour, humming with nicely dressed people. In fact, a few years ago they were filming a movie in Montreal and many of the actors were staying at the Vogue and I was invited to a private party at the Vogue Bar, and was served a martini by George Clooney!True story.The concierege will go out of his way for you. On this trip, I was extremely busy with appointments but needed to find a particular bottle of French wine with a hard to find vintage year of 1994 that I was unable to locate in my home city. I called the concierge and he tracked down two bottles for me. It was delivered back to the hotel and wrapped for transport back to Toronto.They also seem to keep their staff a long time. The doormen have been there for many years and I continually recognize other staff. They are clearly doing something right on many levels.Bottom Line: There is no need to stay anywhere else in Montreal."
76,1455,"Oct 4 2007 	Consistently Excellent	I've been vacationing in Montreal for the past 10 years, and I can safely say the Vogue is the best downtown hotel. The staff is superb and they always seem genuinely happy to go the extra mile.Example - Shortly after entering my room, the front desk called and mentioned that the bell hop thought the room was rather dry, so they offered to send up a humidifier. I experienced that level of attention throughout multiple visits to the Vogue. This attention also extends to room service which is extremely prompt and the menu has something for everyone -- my girlfriend thought the three-cheese pasta was the best pasta she'd ever had.Rooms are big and clean with massive bathrooms that contain a bath (many with tvs) and separate standing shower. The mini-bar is very extensive and they include plenty of snacks that actually taste good.The location is unbeatable. Right off St. Catherine st. in the heart of the always active downtown area. Everything you want is within walking distance, including the metro.And if you like to feel secure during your stay, you're in luck. This is the only hotel I know of to require a room key in order to use the elevator.Overall, one of the best hotel experiences in Montreal."
77,1455,"Aug 26 2007 	Loved Hotel Vogue!!	Hotel Vogue was in the heart of downtown Montreal. My husband and I were there for business in the winter of 2005. Our room was very, very clean, comfortable, and high-end. Be sure to ask for a room at the rear of the hotel so that you don't hear the nightlife of Montreal when you're ready to sleep. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful with restaurant tips, maps, parking, etc. You can walk where ever you need to go from this hotel. Our favorite breakfast stop was just a block away! One of the nights we got caught in a winter snow storm in Old Montreal and couldn't find a cab anywhere, so we walked back to our hotel, about 12 blocks or so? Upon arrival around 1:00 a.m., covered in snow, they offered to bring some hot tea or warm cocktails up to the room for us! Professional, courteous staff all around!"
78,1455,"Aug 24 2007 	Great Hotel!!!	Lovely, clean and upscale. Large marble bathroom had a tv, whirlpool tub and separate shower. Helpful staff, clean and comfy bed. Will stay there again."
79,1455,"Aug 15 2007 	First time at the Vogue and going back later this month!	As the title of my reviews suggest it, I liked it so much, I will be going back on my next visit to Montreal! What a great hotel! If you look at my profile, you'll notice that I'm a Montreal regular and usually go a few times in the summer. I'm also a Priceline regular but this time, I wanted to indulge and it was also the Nascar AND Pride week-end in Montreal which meant few hotels had availabilty. Found a good rate at the Loews and jumped on it and boy, was I ever glad I did! What makes this hotel so special certainly is it's high level of personalized yet, not overpretentious service. Of course, you have it's great rooms too! From the moment we walked in the door to our departure, we had everything we could have wanted. Bellman always there to greet you, nice fresh cut flowers in the relatively small, but elegant lobby. Check-in and concierge staff were gracious and made us feel at home. They were professional, yet not cold and too distant like the often case of large chain hotels. Such a constrast with the Sheraton I stayed at a few weeks before a few blocks from there. Cannot say enough good things about the staff. I called them back to book again for late August and the lady at the reservation office was equally helpful and you can just tell they like what they do.The hotel might not have a pool or many services, but it's rooms are heavenly. Certainly not dated but rather decorated in a more classice way. Our furniture was in a good repair. The housekeeping and cleanliness top notch. They vacuum around the edges. The bed was the best I slept in so far this year, liked it better than Westin's heavenly bed. The pillows were equally amazing, I would have all brought them back home but then housekeeping would have noticed... Kidding aside, bathroom equally great, despite the shower being more ordinary than is some other prestigious hotels but still fine in my book. I'm a Loews First member and all my preference were accomodated and the wine and nuts promptly sent up to the room. We had a queen room with a four-poster bed overlooking De la Montage which others found noisy but I did not. Drapes keep the room pitch dark, it's quite amazing. There is an iHome iPod compatible radio in the room If you have one.The location is great, we were in town for Divers-Cit and even if this hotel is relatively far from the Gay village, it's an easy subway or cab ride away (Mtro is two blocks away, Peel). In fact, it's proximity to Ste-Catherine and Crescent is a big plus for some. We had a good time on top of L'hotel de la Montagne patio's on the rooftop across the street. Nice spot for a quick eat/drink on a sunny summer afternoon.I was very sad to leave this wonderful hotel and bed for home. I cannot wait to be back later this month and am ready to make it my only home away from home in Montreal."
80,1455,"Aug 4 2007	4th time at the Vogue. Still the best.	This is the fourth time we have stayed at the Hotel Vogue. We always look forward to staying there and were not disappointed. The staff is wonderfully courteous and efficient. Our room was nicely appointed. We had a package that included parking and room service breakfast which was very nice. US newspapers are delivered to your door each morning. Location is great near galleries, museums and McGill. We will be back."
81,1455,"Jul 28 2007	What a great place to stay!	My friend and I decided to go shopping in Montreal last March (sorry for the delay in writing this). Neither of us had very much experience with Montreal hotels, so after internet searches we decided to stay at the Vogue. We were totally unprepared for the Vogue experience.We flew into Montreal and arriving early at the hotel we were concerned that we would have to wait hours to get into our room. While checking in, a hotel guest who was sitting in the lobby asked us if it was our first time here? When we answered 'yes' he said &quot;well, it won't be your last, you will never stay anywhere else in Montreal&quot;. My friend and I just smiled and looked at each other rather skeptically as we were not particularly impressed with the lobby. It was clean but small and unassuming. Anyway, our room was available and we drilled the fellow who brought out bags to our room. He was soooo knowledgeable about the city and spent at least twenty minutes with us, providing shopping and restaurant tips. I could go on and on but the long and short of it - the doorman and all of the bellmen knew we were there to shop and became quite excited when we came back with bags and equally disappointed when we returned empty handed.We dined one night at the hotel restaurant. The service was impeccable and food superb. The amuse bouche was wonderful.The hotel bar!!The hotel bar!!! After the third night of going there for a nightcap we became 'regulars' as were 90% of the people there. Everyone knew each other as they all had been coming to the hotel for years and the bartender knew them on a first name basis. I happened to mention to someone that my husband was a scuba diver - the next thing I knew, everyone in the bar was involved in a discussion about scuba diving and providing me tips of the best diving sites in the world to pass onto my husband. Honestly, it is like a small friendly community.As far as our room. It was large and clean. Two very comfortable queen sized beds with lots of room for our luggage and to sit and relax. The bathroom was fabulous. It was enormous with a large jacuzzi tube, separate shower and marble vanity. The room also had a lit vanity mirror and second hairblower in the hallway. This was a bonus for two females!The location is great for shopping - right across the street from Ogilvie's, Holt Renfrew is a short walk with lots of boutiques along the way and St. Catherines Street is very close. Also,the location is a short cab ride to Old Montreal for shopping or dining.One tip - on arriving at the Montreal airport we decided to pay a bit more than the flat fee taxi fare (I can't remember how much) and take a limousine to the hotel. We had decided to take a limo back to the airport but found out that there is a huge increase in limo fares from Montreal back to the airport.My friend and I are going back to the Vogue in the fall!!!"
82,1455,"Jul 23 2007 	Wonderful Experience...we'll be back!	My fiance and I stayed at Loews for a quick romantic weekend get away (we are from New York). We stayed there during Canda Day and Jazz Festival weekend. HOTEL SERVICE: The doorman and valet attendent were wonderful throughout the whole weekend. Room service staff (we ordered from 2x) were very attentative. The front desk staff was alright. The day we left, we called downstairs 20 mins prior to check out to ask them to bring our luggage down and our car around. We waited downstairs for about 15 mins before asking them where our stuff was. They said the valet was getting the car and the bellman was brining down our luggage. Another 10 mins still no luggage or car. So my fiance went up and talked to the front desk who did not apologize but stated she thought it was here. Where we were waiting at she could clearly see there was no luggage or car for us. That was not apprecaited and left a sour taste in my mouth. Not a way to conclude a nice stay. Concierge was ok. She was not very knowledgable unless it came to tours. We brought our car so we didn't need a tour but POI's. She didn't have much to offer in relation to that. She was much better suited at dinner reservations. Loews will give you the menu's of all the places that you maybe interested in and will call there and make your reservation once you have made your selection. Very nice!FOOD: Room service food was wonderful! We had turkey burgers and chocolate milk. YUMMY! Restaurant was ok. We went there our first night for dinner. The french onion soup is to die for!!! For dinner I had a pasta dish that was made with oil. I asked if they could make it with alfredo sauce and the man said no problem at all. It came out with just the oil but I didn't bother to send it back. It tasted ok. We had just finished a 7 hour drive up there and I wasn't interested in waiting for a fresh plate. My fiance enjoyed his meal even though I cannot remember what he had. ROOM: GORGEOUS! it looked just like the pictures on their website. We stayed in a guest room with a canopy bed. It has been of the most luxirous beds I have ever slept it. Total comfort!! The suite was very clean and updated. There was even a vanity area outside of the bathroom with a bench. Really ENJOYED that feature! The bathroom was all marble and gorgeous. We didn't take advantage of the tub but we did take advantage of the glass shower while watching the small flat screen in the bathroom. Nothing like watching CNN with getting all sudsy ;) Hopefully they will have free wi-fi in the rooms one day. We brought our lap top and paid $15/24 hours to use the internet. It is free I believe downstairs on their computers and I didn't notice a line for the PCs when we were down in that area. OVERALL: Highly recommend! We plan on going back and bringing our Yorkies with us. We did see one or two small pets but never heard any barking/noise from any rooms. Very clean, very spacious and we can't wait to return!"
83,1455,"Jul 15 2007 	lovely people lovely hotel	Great hotel with large, clean rooms. My room had a large tub with jets and a tv, so I became completely addicted to a nightly soak and movie. I didn't ask for much, but the hitel staff that I interacted with was friendly and helpful. Stayed last year at the Sofitel which is just a few blocks away. Also a good experience, although they insisted on making up my room everyday despite the fact I put my &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign up every morning. The only down side to either of these hotels is that they're located in the business distract which is less than quaint if that's what you're looking for. Location is convenient for metro or taxi, though.I'd happily recommend the Loews to friends and probably stay again."
84,1455,"Jul 3 2007 	Most satisfying hotel experience EVER	We have travelled extensively around North America and I can say without reservation that this was the most satisfying experience that I've had. Yes, I've stayed at properties that have bigger rooms or more luxurious surroundings, but looking at value, amenities, location and service all together, this hotel is head and shoulders above the rest. An important note: we took the advice noted below and requested a room on a high floor toward the back of the building and we received this with no problem.The room itself is very nicely appointed, with a large bathroom that contains a whirlpool tub with television and a separate shower. There are two hair dryers, one outside the bathroom at a vanity, which really speeded things up in the morning. The bedding is high-quality cotton with down duvets. We were impressed that they offered twice-daily maid service--very nice not to have to reuse wet towels in the morning. The service at the front desk was friendly and prompt. I speak French, but all of the people I spoke to were fluently bilingual. The location of this hotel could not be any more convenient to the main shopping area of rue Ste. Catherine. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the restaurant.We will definitely be finding an excuse to go back to Loews Hotel Vogue."
85,1455,"Jun 22 2007 	Loved This Hotel	Just got back from New York and Montreal. I loved Hotel Vogue. The rooms are great (in size, style and comfort) and you couldn't ask for better service - the staff is exceptional. Great value for your money. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again - one of my best hotel experiences."
86,1455,Jun 18 2007	Great stay at Hotel Vogue	My husband and I spent a long weekend in Montreal and enjoyed our stay at Hotel Vogue. The service at the hotel is outstanding. The bathrooms are large and were always stocked with plenty of towels. The rooms are large and clean.My only complaint about the hotel was the noise from the street. The hotel is a block away from Crescent and the noise from the bars on Friday and Saturday night got a little loud.
87,1455,"Jun 1 2007 	Best service in Montreal	This was my third trip to Montreal this year, I've lost count at how many in the last few years, all on business. I've been looking at the Loew's Vogue for awhile and this time I booked it. All I can say is, I finally found a hotel with great staff, good beds and first class housekeeping all in a really good location. I had a suite with what the hotel calls an 'urban' view - code for no view. Didn't matter as I was out all day and preferred the quiet away from the noise of busy Rue de la Montagne. I could actually sleep. The hotel is only 9 floors, so there are no great views from any room. I had two fellow travelers there as well and their rooms were on low floors and faced Montagne so they had lots of noise. The 'living room' area was very large but had no windows as it was in a corner area. Now that I wasn't crazy about. I could have done with less space but lots of windows. The dining table made for great meeting space. There was a 46&quot; flat screen with a DVD player and surround sound. A guest bath was handy as we worked for most of the afternoon.The bedroom was about the size of their Premium room and had a king bed, desk with a good chair, lots of phones, and a small club chair for sitting. Nice 27 inch TV with DVD built in. Good radio/CD player clock in the rooms. The bath was huge, but that did take away for the room space. Two narrow windows. One of my fellow travelers had a Deluxe room [standard] and said it was small for him and his wife. All had nice appointments and though not new, the furnishings and carpets were spotless and well maintained. The Opera Bar off the lobby had excellent drinks and offered light meals. I didn't try the restaurant as Cresent St with lots of choices is just a block over. Eggspectations was half a block in one direction and St Cathrine's half a block in the other. Old Montreal is a cab ride away, so this hotel is not as well placed as many for those visiting on vacation.Staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Better than the Omni, Sofitel, or the Ritz. Turn down service included fresh towels. The only thing I didn't like, besides the lack of windows in the living room, was no wi-fi. I really wish hotels would do two things: 1. include internet access in the rate [I pay enough for the room, so PLEASE stop charging me $14.95 + tax per day] and 2. have wi-fi OR hard wire choices in the rooms. I like to sit on a sofa or love seat and work in comfort. The other thing was a tiny shower stall in the guest bath. The main bath had a jetted tub with a hand-held shower. Not my favorite after a long day so I used the little stall instead.The Loew's Vogue made a believer of me. And if for no other reason, the great staff, I will go back, even if it;s only a standard room. Two thumbs way up."
88,1455,"Jun 1 2007	OK but ONLY because I got a great deal	The only reason I chose to stay at this hotel for a weekend in May was because only this and one other hotel in the city offer special benefits through my credit card. Next time, I probably will forgo my credit card benefits and stay at another hotel as I noticed there are many others that appear to be newer and more luxurious.The hotel was an excellent value for what I paid. I was upgraded (through my credit card) to a one-bedroom suite with two bathrooms (with useless flat panel tvs above the tubs) all for the price of the cheapest room. The view was of another building across an ugly alley, but that was fine, since the room was large and adequate, although dated (no flat screen TVs in the main room, fancy radios, or updated light fixtures, bedding, etc.) The room also seemed a bit worn around the edges and the condition of the carpet was only so-so. It was like an airport Hilton that hadn't been updated since the mid 90s and without marble bathrooms.I dont want to come off sounding like a snob, but a hotel rated this high should be a lot nicer. Especially since it was voted Trip Advisors best luxury in Montreal. This hotel is by no means bad, but it absolutely CANNOT be the best luxury hotel in Montreal. It needs a loving overhaul. The lobby was small, but nice with two computers for free internet. Valet was $30 CAD a night and I did notice that there were some public parking lots nearby. There is no hotel driveway so your car is left double parked in the street and they hurry you through like crazy to free up the space. Room service arrived on time and was presented nicely. I was happy with the amount of salmon that came with the lox and bagel selection.Every staff member I interacted with was extremely friendly and helpful - especially housekeeping.Next time I will either stay in a boutique hotel in the Old Port/Old Montreal area or the glitzy Sofitel on Sherbrooke (every time our cabdrove us by the Sofitel I strangely felt drawn to it  it was modern and definitely looked good.).The Loews Vogue wasn't terrible and you'll have a fine time, but there are better options in Montreal. If you do stay here join the Loews loyalty club on their website for the perks."
89,1455,"May 31 2007	Very good service	We just loved our recent stay at the Vogue! The service is always very good, the location is great and they have those small attentions that make a difference (they let a bag in our car with 2 apples and 2 bottles of water for the road).The breakfast (room service) was delicious.We just can't wait to go back!"
90,1455,"May 30 2007	Spacious Rooms Great Location	Stayed at Hotel Vogue in a Junior Suite with our two young children in early May. We usually reserve suites when our family travels together and this Suite, in comparison to others we have stayed in, was extremely spacious and well appointed. We really appreciated the 2 full bathrooms and all of the extra space.The Hotel was very centrally located and within walking distance to many restaurants and stores.Service was very attentive in the Hotel although we found the waitstaff in the main dining room at breakfast a little supercilious. I did not feel that &quot;LOEWS Loves Kids&quot; in the Dining Room at the Hotel Vogue. Room service was prompt, helpful when we ordered our children's meals and asked for different options than offered on the menu, and decent in quality.I would definitely recommend this Hotel for families. My kids loved the big jar of M&amp;M's at the Front Desk...a nice welcome touch for little ones.Overall, a very comfortable stay that met, and sometimes exceeded my expectations."
91,1455,"May 29 2007 	Nice Hotel!	We just returned from a 4 night stay at Loews. The hotel was very nice, the hotel staff goes out of their way to make you happy! The bathroom was awesome with the huge bathtub with jets and extra large towels. The room was large and came with complimentary valet and breakfast (room service breakfast was wonderful!). My only complaint was that there was some construction going on outside of our room and it was very loud and started at 7am. We called the front desk and they moved us to a quieter room. Other than that it was a great stay. The hotel bar was very fun!"
92,1455,"May 16 2007 	Best Hotel 	First thing you do is join the Lowes First program...This is the hotel in Montreal, we have stayed in several and this is it. Wonderful restaurnats and shopping right outside your door. The staff cares about your stay and are attentive. The rooms are comforatble and bathroom is amazing, marble tub w/ telly.Beds are soft and cozy..nice sheets.Great little apps and wine in the lobby bar.Just a great hotel...It is where we always stay in Montreal. Can't beat it or the price! Just can't say enough nice things about this hotel."
93,1455,"Apr 21 2007	bon jour Montreal !!	Great location and great staff . The room was spotless clean . Seemed like they were expecting us . We loved the maple fudge that they served in the afternoon . One block and you will be on St Catherine Avenue . I would definately stay there again . Merci !!P &amp; W Doudar , Los Angeles"
94,1455,"Apr 12 2007 	OK experience follow-up serive amazing!	On a recent(ish) trip to Montreal, we stayed at the Vogue. Firstly, I'll just say it was a little less than I was expecting. Everything was kind of dated and the electric baseboard would buzz all night long.We were lucky enough to be on the top-level. We had a street-side room, and I wouldn't recommend it. My view was of apartments across the street, who could easily see in, and vice versa. Also, I had to take a midday nap (after Lasik surgery) and I was constantly woken up by noises, mostly traffic, but the worst of which was the doorman constantly whistling for a taxi cab.The room was fairly spacious, but quite dark and likewise with the bathroom. True, the whirlpool tub was quite nice, but all the black marble made it very dark. The shower stall was just tiny, and actually had a plastic bottom - odd.Room service wasn't great. I don't know if it was due to a language problem, but I never really got what I ordered, and in one instance it took an hour for a grilled cheese and slice cheescake.Let me just say, I filled out a Survey for this Hotel, and was delighted to receive a response from the Manager who apologise profusely and refunded my delayed room service. They also guaranteed I would never have this problem again! Absolutely amazing, and bumped up the rating on this stay.As for location, It's right there off a main street of shopping. It isn't near the underground city, but not too far to walk to.We also ate at the restaurant there, and since we were the only ones there had amazing service. We were attended to and also left alone to enjoy our meals and wine. The food was really quite good, and our waiter was very friendly and just generally pleasant.All in all, we might stay there again, should we go back to Montreal. We'd probably avoid room service since the food wasn't great. Infact it was fairly average. I'd insist on a back room, and we'd probably make a dinner reservation at the restaurant."
95,1455,"Apr 11 2007	Well-located Great Service and Beautiful!	Just returned from a 3-night stay at the Loews Vogue, and it was truly a delight! It's a boutique hotel, located right near first class shopping and restaurants in downtown Montreal. The service was great, rooms are beautiful ... no complaints whatsoever. The bathroom is very large (at least in the Premium rooms), with a jacuzzi tub, and a small TV among the nicest features. The bed was extremely comfortable.The lobby has 2 computers available for guests to access the internet free of charge. You can also get internet service from your room, but there is a per-diem charge for that (about $14 I think).. There's a cozy and stylish little bar area where you can have a drink, and another area with comfy chairs, a sofa, and a fireplace where you can read the newspaper etc.The only thing to avoid is the hotel's restaurant. The food was very mediocre and disappointing, in contrast to so many other places in Montreal. Service was only fair, even when the restuarant was practically empty. Don't waste your money! You are steps away from much better food ... even the food courts in the malls are better."
96,1455,"Apr 5 2007 	A First Class Experience!	My husband and I decided to spend a night in Montreal on our way to Quebec City. Prior to booking, we joined their LoewsFirst Club- a MUST! Not ony did this entitle us to free parking and a daily newspaper, but we could also choose a complementary which would be waiting for us upon our arrival (we chose a tray of fruit and bottled water). Parking and check-in went smoothly and our room had lovely classical music playing when we entered. The bed was extremely comfortable! The bathroom was tremendous with a separate shower, a huge jacuzi bathtube, a television and two bathrobes! I could have spent my entire vacation in that bathroom! Since I had paid for the breakfast package (which is served in your room), we had a continental breakfast the next morning, which although delicious, was quite inadequate. We were hungry within two hours. If you are booking a breakfast package, I recommend pay ing a few dollars more and requesting the American breakfast- a much better deal! When dining out, avoid the hotel's Ristorante Cellini. The food was lousy and over priced. There are much better restaurant choices in the vicinity."
97,1455,"Mar 24 2007 	Great Value Jetted Tub and friendly staff	Wife and I just got back from Montreal and had a great stay at the Loews Vogue Montreal. Being from the west coast I wasn't very familiar with the Loews chain, we don't have one in Vancouver or Seattle - as a matter of fact I don't think they even have one in Toronto. Nonetheless, this place was a gem. My room was $189 and included chocolates nightly on the pillows, a surprise gift which was an ice wine type local product. The room was a good size, the bed was absolutely perfect. We chose a King Size bed and it took all we had to get up in the morning - very very comfortable. The bathroom was the best I've ever experienced. Alot of square footage, a Jetted tub, seperate shower, and heat lamp for additional warmth. They have a DVD rental program and lots of little extra's like free shoe polishing, Customer service was second to none and location could not be better. One street over from very active Crescent street and a block up for shopping haven Ste.Catherine's street. I've staye and more high end hotels than I could count - The Loews is my new favorite. We need a Loews in western canada."
98,1455,"Mar 4 2007 	First time staying at Loews hotel chain..and will return	It was our first visit to Montreal( we went end of Sept.. sorry for late review) and we usually pick luxury hotels if possible when travelling. 4 to 5 star. The Loews met our expectations.LocationWe found the hotel was difficult to find because of all the one way streets around the hotel. We missed the turn as the hotel is not located on a main street. So make sure you ask for good directions when leaving the airport.Service We took the red eye flight, at the time it seemed like a good idea at the time. However, we forgot that check in was at 4 pm. So we were forced to tour Old Montreal early. Our room was not ready but the front desk said they would call us once it was. We were able to get our room around 3 pm.. so we were very tired. The hotel lobby is small and your room key is required to access the elevator. The doorman was very helpful with directions and greeted us each time we came and left the hotel. When it rained, the doorman provided us with an umbrella for our shopping trips. There were fruits in the lobby for guests, hidden the corner.ParkingValet parking is the only choice. we found they we had to wait often despite calling ahead of time. I think they were short staffed and the hotel does not have a private drive for the valet cars so you see the staff moving cars alot along the busy Montreal street the hotel is located. If you are thinking about self parking, there is none that is within walking distance. One thing about Montreal, some of the older areas, you will notice very narrow streets. RoomWhen we finally did settle into our room, the room was a nice size. Bathroom was nice, jacuzzi tub with T V, separate walk in shower, separate vanity/make up mirror outside of bathroom. Bed was comfortable, clean room. no dust. window coverings provide a dark room if you are looking to catch some sleep. Nightly turn down included. Location/Attractions NearbyThe hotel is located directly across from a gentleman's club and the shopping district on St. Catherines Street./underground shopping. also has several gentleman's entertainment and shopping, an odd mix but you see the bouncer standing outside of these locations. You can't miss the neon signs. But, dont' worry it is child friendly and we found the crowd was not as loud as downtown Toronto night life. Loved the location it was very close to the underground shopping centre that Montreal is so popular. Shopping was great because we found lots of deals ( end of summer sales).. We found alot of restaurants within walking distance. However, to tour Montreal I would recommend renting a car to see Old Montreal or Latin town. Lots of choices of restaurants if you are willing to drive 20-30 mins."
99,1455,"Mar 2 2007 	Great location super-comfortable room	We often go to Montreal, but have never stayed at the Vogue. We really enjoyed our stay there. The location is great, the bed super-comfortable, and the towels are extremely abundant and plush. The hotel also has a small gym with nice cardio equipment."
100,1455,"Feb 26 2007 	Best Service in Montreal	My wife and I stayed in early Feb. 2007 for a good week-end shopping trip. The service was excellent.The rooms were very good. Nice, spacious and quiet.The bathroom was very good. Above average size, deep jacuzzi tub, shower and bathrobes.The downstairs restaurant was average.Room service was excellent.Free internet downstairs in the lobby.If traveling by car, do yourself a favor and take the package deal for breakfast(continental) and parking. Worth every penny since parking is getting expensive in Montreal, including no more free parking on Sundays."
101,1455,"Feb 20 2007 	Best Hotel!!	My husband &amp; I stayed in this hotel last weekend and we absolutely loved it. We went there for my birthday and the concierge essentially planned everything for us. He recommeded a wonderful bakery (a 10 minute walk from the hotel), a wonderful spa (a 5 minute walk from the hotel) and a wonderful romantic restaurant on the same street as the hotel! In addition, on the actual birthday, the hotel surprised us with two wonderful cakes!! The room was amazing! The service was superb! Def. can't wait to go back!! I highly recommend this gem."
102,1455,"Feb 20 2007	Amazing Stay	I was staying at this hotel on business last week and I must say that it is THE best hotel I've ever stayed in. More than the gorgeous rooms, the great bathroom, the fantastic food......the service and staff were second to none. They're the best ever, in every way."
103,1455,"Feb 12 2007 	Best part of the trip!	We had a very rough, unlucky weekend of bad travel and bad weather and the only bright spot of the trip was Hotel Vogue! From the moment we arrived the service was amazing, the rooms were very nice and the concierge was so helpful. We loved staying here and would absolutely recommend it if you're looking for a peaceful getaway and a great hotel! If we go to Montreal again, there is no question we would stay here."
104,1455,"Dec 28 2006 	A lovely Christmas at Loews	We spent Christmas weekend in this hotel and had a great time. The rooms are well equipped and the sheets are especially luxurious. The bathroom was huge and always well stocked with towels, high-end soaps and bath products. The staff is very friendly and eager to help. The hotel itself is in a great location. The street is relatively quiet in terms of foot traffic, but it is Montreal and if somebody's having a good time a couple of blocks away, you're bound to hear it. It is close to the main shopping strip, great restaurants and other tourist attractions. We felt safe and looked after in this hotel, and though we knew the neighbouring rooms were occupied, we never once saw or heard anything.We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel again. It has the true Montreal charm that is lacking from the larger hotels."
105,1455,"Nov 28 2006	Great Location	Room was nice, but if you need peace and quiet ask to stay in a room facing away from the main street. The location was only blocks away from shopping and nightlife. The rooms were large and comfortable. I would stay here again. 3.5 out of 5"
106,1455,"Nov 23 2006	11/24 - Loud construction 6am to 7pm - Single pane windows.	While we loved the hotel charm, friendliness, et al., When you get woken up before 7am with construction noises outside of your window you quickly realize the Most important thing about a hotel is that you get some sleetp.A building is being torn down on the rear of the property. Our neighbor says that he heard the noises too. Blinds and curtains don't help much when there are single Pane windows that let the sound in.Avoid this hotel until December."
107,1455,"Nov 23 2006	class all the way	not only is The Loews vogue hotel located in the hot spot of downtown Montreal, but when you walk in there, you know you've in a classy spot!!!Upon our arrival we were greated by bell boy right outside the door. We left him the keys and went it where we were warmly welcome by the clerk who was courteous and helpful. Once in our premium room we were pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous huge bathroom with tv in spa bath. My favorite. The clerk actuall called minutes after our check-in to make sure the room was to our liking. Our view was of the outdoor terrace, which in the summer time might have been an issue if there was an event but in the bginning of fall, ws perfect for us. The hotel has a full time concirge there to guide you for restaurants, shoping and activites.. although it's obvious to shop at Louis Vuitton, Holt Renfrew and Ogilvy which are just accross the street. The restaurant was absolutly great, great service, great food... But too many peoploe waiting on you at once and they don't really communicate.The eager bus boy who cleared or table 3 times... once when we went to the bathroom and twice when we went outside to smoke. Other than that, we had a 500$ bill and it was well worth it.When we finally checked out of the hotel, we were escorted to our car which had a bag of treats, a great thougtful gift for our roadtrip home.EXCELLENT STAY!"
108,1455,"Nov 21 2006 	Excellent Hotel	We have just had a few days at this lovely hotel. Right from check in the service was extremely efficient and friendly. We consulted the concierge desk several times for restaurants and car hire and they could not have been more helpful. The room was big and pleasant and I particularly liked the fact that there was a properly lit dressing table area in the room - pretty rare in my experience. The bed was very comfortable. There was noise from the street outside on Friday and Saturday nights, other nights were ok. The location is great, very central, and there is a fantastic department store called Ogilvys opposite the hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly return."
109,1455,"Nov 4 2006 	Good not great	Service in the hotel and at the bar is excellent. They allowed us to move our room when the noise from a nearby street concert was getting out of control. Would not recommend the restaurant at all though (our distracted, angry waiter messed up our breakfast order and then disappeared, returning only to overcharge us). Yes, the bill was fixed but it was a very unpleasant experience that management did not really care to address. Rooms are very comfy, bathroom very nice. Workout room small and cramped. However, the location is excellent and security elevators means you must be a guest there in order to go to any floor.Woudl I stay there again? Not sure. Would probably try elsewhere first. If you do stay there, get a deal that includes valet (the charges for valet parking are expensive)."
110,1455,"Nov 2 2006 	What Makes This a Great Place	I arrived at Loews in Montreal after a 14 hour delay at the hub airport from which I departed - getting in close to midnight. When I reached the front desk, the hasstles of the day ended. I was checked-in quickly and smoothly, baggage sweep up by the bell captain, shown to my room (great corner room, in quiet location) -- and despite the hour, was told that no problem at all exited with room service, that it operated 24-hours a day, and one could even have breakfast anytime throughout the day. Dinner arrived in less than minutes, everything just right and as ordered.And so it continued for 4 days: for example, when out of tea in the room, a supply was delivered by a hall captain; when a problem existed with a plug for the lamp, an electrician appeared in short order; and when some supplies were needed for a professional presentation, the concierge provided just what was needed.It is the case that the rooms are well furnished and well equipped, and that the bathrooms are terrific. A certain range of other hotels have those features too -- but few (if any) provide the service, the attentiveness, and the superb staffing of Loews Hotel Vogue-Montreal. A great place !"
111,1455,"Oct 15 2006 	Excellent Hotel	Just spent a romantic weekend at this great hotel. The room was spacious and well furnished. The staff was very attentive and polite. We really enjoyed the lounge and their sausage appetizers. The only complaint is the noise from the street below. As long as you don't go to sleep before 3 am, you'll be fine. The jet tub is a great way to start the day. I would suggest this hotel for any getaway."
112,1455,"Oct 15 2006 	TripAdvisor - on the money again!	Although Hotel Vogue doesn't maintain the highest hotel star rating, there is absolutely no reason it shouldn't! The rates were modest for the area, the service sublime and the room was fabulous. Please note: You must force yourself out of bed. It's that comfortable and peaceful of a night's sleep.From the knowledgeable conceirge to the happy-go-lucky bellmen and doormen, we felt as if we were staying in our home away from home. When we departed, we were gifted adieu apples and water bottles to ensure our appetites and thirsts would be quenched in our travels home. Book this hotel. Period."
113,1455,"Oct 9 2006 	Great Unless You Want to Sleep	This is a charming, upper-end property in the heart of the city. The only problem? Single-paned windows mean you hear everything -- I mean everything from the street below. There are lots of bars below. See where I'm going? Loud, loud, loud in the rooms.We checked out after one day and headed to the Inter-Continental, a fabulous place."
114,1455,"Oct 2 2006 	Just Great!	This was a TripAdvisor choice and it was just great!Room was spotlessly clean, roomy, comfortable and the bathroom was modern and well appointed.Staff were as good as you'd find anywhere, and the restaurant and bar were both top class."
115,1455,"Sep 25 2006 	Staff puts this hotel a cut above the rest.	Inspired by the overwhelmingly positive reviews I read on the web, I booked this hotel for it's location and jetted tub. I would reccomend it without hesitation to anyone primarily beause our experience with the staff- they were outstanding at every single turn with everything from booking us appointments at a nearby spa to accomodating my boyfriend's need to keep his insulin (type one diabetic) cold at all times. The room service was lightning quick even in the middle of the night and while pricey (which was to be expected) the portions were quite generous and the quality surpassed my expectation for hotel food. If I was going to nit-pick one tiny thing, I wished the lighting in the bathroom had a dimmer switch or a different option- the somewhat harsh overhead light took away from the relaxation we so anticipated in the tub. Everything else was outstanding, and I look forward to staying there again."
116,1455,Sep 23 2006 	loved this hotel	stayed at this hotel for 3 nights the staff couldnt do enough for you and the rooms were wonderful. The location was perfect would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any one.
117,1455,Sep 21 2006 	Flawless	Just lovely. Exquisite rooms. Clean and excellent. Great location. I felt like a movie star. A pool would have made it perfect
118,1455,"Sep 15 2006 	Delightful Hotel	This hotel is a gem in the heart of Montreal. Spent a delightful weekend at the Vogue. Close to everything in downtown Montreal. One half a block from Ste Catherine Street shopping, the hotel offered an oasis of quiet in the middle of Canada's most dynamic city. Room service breakfast was fabulous. Staff was most helpful. The marble bathrooms were great as were the duvet comforters and feather beds. Would stay at this hotel anytime I visit Montreal."
119,1455,"Sep 10 2006 	Fantastic Customer Service at Hotel Vogue	We started our 3 week trip of Canada in Hotel Vogue and we could not have asked for a better beginning. We were slightly apprehensive of what we would find as we had got a 3 nights for the cost of 2 deal and therefore we were sure they must have scrimped on something but that was most deinitely NOT the case. Our room was enormous and clean with an amazing en-suite bathroom. MArble all round - large jacuzzi bath as well as separate shower and there was even a TV in the bathroom as well. The staff were friendly and polite and Phillippe, the concierge assisted us advice on all sorts of things.Definitely recommend it to all.Hotel Vogue is also in a great part of town, with everything no more than a 30 min walk."
120,1455,"Sep 5 2006 	Loved the Hotel Vogue	My husband and I visited the Hotel Vogue for a Labor Day weekend getaway. We picked the hotel by using Trip Advisor, and we were not disappointed. The hotel was absolutely beautiful. Our room was enormous. It had an entryway, a makeup application area with lights and a bench, and the largest bathroom I have ever seen at a hotel. The bathroom had a fabulous jacuzzi, which we used every night while we were there. Another nice touch was the plants in the room and in the bathroom. There was a flat screen television in the bathroom. While that's certainly not a necessary amenity, it did feel extremely luxurious. Housekeeping was wonderful. They even straightened up at night when they came for turn down service- and left classical music on to relax us when we came back to the room. The hotel was extremely well situated, right in the heart of downtown Montreal. We could not have been happier with our stay, and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a little pampering in the center of the city."
121,1455,"Aug 28 2006 	Top Notch	Reviews were right on the money..Had a great stay with my wife. Rooms are spacious, quiet, &amp; clean, with exceptionally comfortable beds, sparkling linens, and a stocked mini bar. Bathrooms are luxurious with marble tubs, quick filling bath with powerful jets &amp; a nice mini t.v. to boot. One of our days was very rainy &amp; the comfort of the hotel made it enjoyable. The staff is extremely attentive, and really went above &amp; beyond the call of duty to ensure a nice birthday for my wife. I would never stay anywhere else in Montreal. Thanks again to the Vogue staff for a great stay."
122,1455,"Aug 20 2006 	Perfect	Our 5 night stay confirmed everything positive you've read up to this point.The hotel is beautifulThe rooms are gigantic (we were upgraded because it was our wedding anniversary, simply by asking)The bedding is wonderfulThe &quot;electronics&quot; are great -- DVD/VCR, you can hook up your iPod (if you bring proper cabling), lots of TV stations (which is kind of fun if you're from out of the country and enjoy discovering French-language TV)The staff is impeccable. Everytime we called for help (and we kind of asked for a lot of little things) they sounded genuinely eager to help -- and did.This hotel is the very definition of refined, timeless luxury. Would stay again without hesitation."
123,1455,"Aug 20 2006	Vogue Honeymoon	We had a great time at the Vogue on our June 2006 honeymoon. The room was large and luxurious. We particularly enjoyed the special welcome note to the new &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot; with chocolate covered strawberries upon arrival. Our luggage was lost by the airlines, but the hotel staff was eager to help. They asked if we preffered to have it delivered to our room if it arrived in the middle of the night or if we would rather have them keep it at the desk until morning. We chose the former and, after a phone call, it was delivered at 3am as soon as it arrived at the hotel. We were grateful.The conceirge was helpful in offering suggestions for tourist attractions and in providing a map along with personal directions to some of our destinations.The room was spotless and always looked great upon our return each day. We were pleased to have the turndown service and even puttered around in the small, but well equiped gym on our floor. We loved the bathroom with it's whirlpool tub and mounted TV. The robes were nice to slip into as well. Well suited for romance.It's in a great location: nearby Metro stop, St. Catherine St., and Crescent St. We walked everywhere: to Old Montreal, to Mont Royal, to the riverfront, to McGill, and to wonderful shopping and restaurants in downtown. We only rode the Metro out to Olympic Park and the botanical gardens. We definitely recommend this hotel. The room was fabulous and the staff very kind! I am certain that we will stay there again if we return for an anniversary."
124,1455,"Aug 9 2006	Awesome service and location	This hotel is awesome. The service was perfect, from the moment i arrived, the bellman took my bags and the check-in was quick and smooth. During my entire stay, there was always a doorman ready to greet me and open the door. It's located a block from the pubs and restaurants of Crescent street and in the center of the city. The old town Montreal is just a 5 to 10 min taxi ride away. The room was very large and comfortable, the linens were awesome. The bathroom was HUGE, with marble everywhere, a seperate tub and shower stall, and a small TV. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. For a more romantic getaway, i would recommend the St Sulpice in old-town Montreal, i've stayed there many times and it is a great hotel."
125,1455,"Jul 28 2006	The best hotel stay I've ever experienced	An understated elegance permeats this boutique hotel: from the friendly yet non-snobbish doormen, the non-flashy yet classy lobby, the intimate bar, the professional and sincere front desk staff to the well-maintained room. Not to mention the full-size marble bath tub. My first visit to the hotel was about 6 years ago, I was very delighted to find out that everything was just perfect as I had remembered. If all the hotel staff and rooms are like this, I would stop complaining about business trips as much! Kudos to the management team. You should be proud of yourselves!"
126,1455,Jul 21 2006	A hop skip and a jump away from rue St. Catherine's	I love the location it's just a hop skip and a jump away from St. Catherine's street. I lived in the area for many years so I'm familiar with the area. I loved waking up to the trade papers every morning and seeing the Bell Cap dressed in his array. As soon as I approached the Hotel the doors were opened my bags were wisked away and from that moment on the Vogue had me in the palm of it's hands.
127,1455,"Jul 9 2006	top of the line	I have been returning to the Hotel Vogue ever since it opened in 1990, and I can tell you it is still one of the best hotel experiences I've had, anywhere.As a hotel owner myself, and director of marketing, I know the business. I can say without hesitation that management here is terrific, and that the staff is so, so well trained I wanted to steal them all for our hotel.They are pleasant, informed, well groomed, clear, and just a delight to deal with.A request for a room change was handled perfectly: No questions asked, the room was changed, and the guests were happy. This is the way it should always be done.Congratulations, et tres tres bien fait (well done).MerciJim BraudeDirector Of MarketingHotel Saint Louis Bastille Paris France"
128,1455,"Jul 4 2006	Everything we expected it to be	We have never in our lives spent $329.00 Canadian per night on a hotel room and we've travelled the world. But this was our 25th wedding anniversary and we live close to Montreal so we were after comfort for once, not a zany room in a madly exotic destination. Just for once, we decided to experience what a really comfortable hotel experience was like. It was great. What I especially appreciated was that we were left alone until we needed something. Regardless of what it was, and even in the middle of the night, whatever it was was graciously and quietly brought to us within 10 minutes - rather amazing considering we were on the 8th floor at the very back of the hotel. (The street noise can't travel that far). The room itself was beautiful and fairly sumptious, most especially the bathroom as everyone has commented on Tripadvisor. One thing that I loved but hasn't been mentioned is how easy their rooms are for a woman getting ready to go out. The makeup area is well-lit with a comfy 'vanity' bench, just outside the bathroom. The hairdryer is even there. Putting on makeup couldn't be faster or more comfortable. And the bed was yummy, neither soft or hard. Our simple breakfast in bed of croissant, jam and coffee didn't break the bank as I'd worried it might. The staff are all consistently nice. They make it plain that they're there to help. No one bothered us about not leaving the hotel so they could clean it before lunch. We chose this hotel because it's the only one in Montreal dead in the centre of Montreal's main shopping. Its proximity to shopping meant that I didn't waste valuable cafe-sitting time travelling to take shopping back to my hotel. It costs about $15. for a cab to Old Montreal or up to St-Denis, St-Laurent, Laurier West or 'The Plateau'. To give people a hand deciding, if you're looking for a modern hotel such as Philippe Starke's in London, UK, this isn't it. We had to choose between our love of ultra-modern decor and a classic hotel with classically good service, of which Hotel Vogue is an excellent example. Montreal's more modern hotels are all east of Hotel Vogue, away from the downtown core."
129,1455,"Jun 7 2006	The Vogue was fantastic!	My husband and I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue from May 31st until June 4th. We loved it! We stayed in a queen canopy room -- it was lovely. Elegantly decorated with wonderful linens, a luxurious bath decked out in marble, and a whirlpool to boot. The hotel itself was very clean, and our room was immaculate. Housekeeping was wonderful -- so friendly and they did a terrific job. Our room was cleaned each time we went out and restocked with fresh towels and robes. In the evenings as part of the turn down service, we were stocked with chocolates and a little card letting us know the next day's weather forecast. Our package gave us a daily continental breakfast, served as room service. Fresh croissants, danishes, and muffins were served with excellent jams and marmalade, as well as tea, coffee, and juice, complimented with a vase of fresh flowers. Service by all staff at the hotel was wonderful -- from reception to the concierge, the bellmen to the parking attendants ,we were met with smiling faces all eager to help. The concierges were especially helpful, suggesting restaurants and jazz clubs that turned out to be top notch. Check in and check out were quick and easy, and upon our departure we were handed a little bag for the road containing fresh fruit and bottled waters. A nice touch for a long drive home! My husband and I have stayed at many hotels and resorts in various places around the world that have all been highly rated, but this one may just be our new favorite! Oh, and for dog lovers like us, this is a dog friendly hotel and has room service for dogs consisting of specially prepared balanced meals and bottled water. For those with children (or babies, like us), they offer different programs to make your stay more enjoyable, as well as cribs for the little ones. We can't say enough -- the Loews exceeded all of our expectations! If anyone has any questions, feel free to e-mail me at janiceliv@yahoo.com."
130,1455,"May 30 2006	Amazing Pet Friendly Hotel	This was our first trip with our 2 Yorkies (5 lbs. each). When we arrived each puppy was given a gift bag of treats and practical stuff. Moments after we were in our room a bellman arrived with a large, fluffy dog bed and 2 stainless steel bowls. This was definitely a treat for all of us.The Vogue is about great service as well as lovely rooms. The bathroom was huge and the jacuzzi tub was large and fabulous. This was our 3rd visit to the Vogue and it won't be our last. We love the convenient location to shopping, museums and restaurants."
131,1455,"May 29 2006	Great location in Montreal	Excellent hotel in an excellent location. Had an issue the first night with not getting a double bed, but the receptionist made sure the next night we had the room we wanted.Great friendly staff, a joy all round, would stay here again."
132,1455,May 25 2006 	Lovely hotel	This is a really lovely hotel in a great location. Service is impeccable and the rooms are large and very nicely appointed. Huge jacuzzi bath and separate shower in a very spacious bathroom. Quality towels and bedding; just everything I love in a hotel. Very comfortable and not intimidating for a lady travelling on business alone.
133,1455,"May 21 2006 	Exquisite	This hotel is fabulous!! Wonderful attentive service, sumptuous rooms with marble baths with whirlpool and TV, centrally located. We stayed at this hotel for a week and can't wait to go back. It was like being royalty."
134,1455,"May 2 2006	Still a winner....	I stayed at this hotel a few years ago and liked it very much. Returning this year, I was a bit skeptical in that the hotel was a few years older and was concerned about its wear. I was pleasantly surprised in that the rooms are still first-rate and have been kept up quite nicely. The location is excellent, near all of the Catherine Street shopping. We did have some minor issued at the hotel but after addressing them with the front desk, they were remedied. The only downside is that there is no official hotel restaurant and although there is one attached to the hotel, it is not owned by them and service can be lacking."
135,1455,"Apr 30 2006 	5 star for the Loews Vogue hotel	My wife and I spent 4 days at the hotel and just loved everything about the hotel. We were amazed by the size of the room and the bathroom. We were given an upgrade since our room wasn't ready and we had arrived on an early flight &quot;thanks Sandra&quot;. The in room dining is a little expensive but aren't all hotels similar? We were around the corner from the best Street in Canada, Crescent St. We found an amazing Italian restaurant Pinos that served awesome meals till 2am. The concierge at the Loews recommended it and he was right on. We then went and did a little bar hoping at several pubs and this was all within a block of our hotel. If you want to be in the heart of it, stay at the Loews!!!!!!!!!!"
136,1455,"Apr 28 2006	A five-star experience for a three-star price	I'm very picky about hotels, and generally don't enjoy traveling for work. However, my stay at this hotel made a 5 day conference trip really wonderful. My room was as elegant as a five star hotel in Manhattan. The bathroom had beautiful granite, and in a lovely way, not in the cheesy way you see in many hotels. It had a deep tub as well as a separate glassed-in shower. I never use tubs in hotels, but this was more like a spa, so I used it twice (fun to watch Star Wars with French dubbing at 1am). Even the artwork on the walls was lovely.The room was so quiet and the curtains so thick that I was able to sleep late every day (stayed on west coast time successfully). The two elevators were very fast and I never waited more than a few seconds. Even the gym was decent enough to get me in there working out (and open 24 hours).My only complaint is they charged $15/day for the internet connection (which was very fast). Trying to freeload off the local wireless didn't work. Also, all extra amenities and food are very expensive, so I recommend eating out.I used the metro extensively. It's 2 short blocks from the hotel. The street one walks on, St. Catherine-something, is quite lively with shops, but there are also some (relatively tame-looking) strip joints along that walk and late at night there are transients out and about. The metro stop itself at this particular location (Peel) is a bit gritty; the others I went to were much nicer. So that might be a turn off for some people. I recommend buying a week long pass for $19 if you'll be using it extensively.I would definitely stay here again if I visit Montreal again. This was a magical hotel for me. I was so relaxed there and slept so well (and should add now that the bed linens were wonderful, as was the turndown service which left classical music playing and truly terrific chocolate). And all this for $139/night (plus tax)!"
137,1455,Apr 26 2006	Great Place to Stay	We spent seven nights at Loews Vogue in a junior suite. The stay couldn't have been nicer.We were pampered beyond belief. This hotel far surpasses the competition
138,1455,"Apr 12 2006	Excellent location	My husband and I visited Montreal and stayed at the Loews Hotel for 3 nights. Upon arrival we were given a twin bedroom as it was the only one left. I was disappointed to say the least, however I was assured that we would be given another room the following day. As promised, the following morning we were moved to a 4 poster room. The best part of the hotel is it's location...its 30 seconds walk to the main shopping area....perfect!! The bedrooms have large bathrooms (seperate shower cubicle) with tv's so you can have a bath and watch tv!, the bar is rather small but adequate for a pre/post dinner drink and the restaurant menu sounded nice but the restaurant itself was pretty much empty on all 3 nights. There are plenty of nice restaurants to visit in the Old Town and so it wasn't a problem. The staff were all courteous. All in all a good place to stay."
139,1455,"Mar 25 2006 	Luxury and an Ideal Location	This hotel has the atmosphere and individualized service of a boutique hotel, but is really not that small. Luxurious but unpretentious; beds and bathrooms are outstanding; friendly staff remember your name. Really the only drawback to this hotel is that rooms are hot in this cold weather, and you can't turn down the heat enough. My favorite Montreal hotel, partly because of its location in the heart of the best shopping/nightlife area."
140,1455,"Mar 12 2006	Warm cozy luxuriant...	Located right in the heart of downtown Montreal, this hotel's unprepossing facade faces a very busy street, and across from the very chi-chi Ogilivy's department store. However, the noisy, busy exterior is soon left behind the minute you are welcomed by the accomadating doorman, and step into the small, warm and cozy lobby interior. To the left upon entry was a cozy, bookshelved fireplace and waiting area, furnished with oversized chairs, sofas, and coffee tables displayed with impressive looking hardcover books on art, natural history, architecture, and the like.There is a small, sunken cocktail bar to the right upon entering the lobby, and just beyond that is the hotel restaurant.My husband and I have stayed here twice - once in early fall(October 2005) and again recently in winter (March 4-6, 2006).Both times we were thoroughly satisfied and enjoyed what the hotel had to offer in the way of service, comfort and anemities.A word of caution to summertime and fall guests: because this is a downtown hotel and located right in the heart of the bar-hopping and nightclub scene, ask for a room at the back of the hotel, as the front facing rooms pick up a lot of street noise from below. This is not so much a problem during the winter, when downtown revellers generally stay indoors, and tend to leave their cars at home, but in the summer the noise level picks up quite a bit, and can interfere with a good night's sleep.This was our only complaint (and a minor one, as the room was perfect and met all my expectations), which the hotel front desk staff duly noted.I was pleasantly surprised upon our second stay that the hotel remembered our comments, and not only welcomed us back as guests and greeted us by name upon check-in, but remembered to give us a quieter room towards the back of the hotel. It is the small details such as this which give the hotel extra points for service, as far as we are concerned. Two thumbs up for remembering their homework here!Both times we booked through the hotel's web site, for a premium/deluxe room.Check-in was courteous, prompt and friendly and secure. You are given a credit-card type room key with which you must use on the elevator to access your floor and then your room.Now we come to the best part - the rooms.The rooms are absolutely *WONDERFUL.* Spacious, cozy, warm, and tastefully furnished. Generous closet space (with complimentary umbrella even!), bathrobe, in-room safe, and extra blanket and pillow if needed. The mini-bar (which we did not use) was filled with champagne, wine, imported beer, snacks, etc., with wine glasses, ice bucket and corkscrew nearby (unfortunately, there are no ice machines available on any of the floors - you have to call room service to get ice, or go downstairs to the hotel lobby cocktail bar).The bed was absolutely LUXURIOUS with comfortable (not too hard, or overly soft) king size mattress and bedding which included generous, comfy pillows and an opulent, luxurious, down-filled duvet that you could just sink into and lose yourself. But wait, it gets better...The bathrooms are this hotel's BEST feature and well worth taking advantage of. The huge, marbleized bathroom features a separate enclosed shower area, with the toilet area discretely tucked away from theGENEROUS oversized jacuzzi tub, which can comfortably accomadate two people. There's nothing I love better at a 5-star hotel than to immerse oneself in a luxurious, oversized jacuzzi tub filled to the brim with one's favorite bath essence or oils, and reLAAAX... and this hotel fits the bill perfectly.Towels are luxuriant 100% cotton, and plentiful. Included anemities are tastefully arranged bathroom sundries such as skin lotions, scented soaps, shampoos and cloths.Nightly turndown service was included in the price which included chocolates on the pillow, and the roombeing misted after pillows have been fluffed up, and sheets turned down.This is a wonderful hotel: tasteful, clean, luxurious, friendly and accomadating. I would not hesitate to stay here a third time! My only reluctance from giving this hotel an excellent rating is the lack of individual room temperature controls. I found the room overly warm and the air very dry. Since I always like to turn down the temperature at night before going to sleep, the lack of this feature made it a little uncomfortable. Other than that, it was a near perfect stay.For those who like to bar-hop, there are a plethora of nightclubs, bars and cafes to choose from. Shop-a-holics will enjoy the many boutiques (and Ogilivy's department store across the street)nearby, and for art lovers, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is just up the street. Montreal is also known for it's exceptional cuisine in all of North America, and you will have no problem finding many excellent restaurants nearby - all within comfortable walking distance of the hotel's front doors!As a final note, I would avoid eating in the hotel dining room (or even ordering room service), as it tends to be overly pricey. Instead, I highly recommend taking a stroll over to Crescent street and thereabouts to enjoy the many diverse choices of restaurant cuisine offered.~appaloosa12/03/2006"
141,1455,"Mar 12 2006	Top notch	We spent a weekend at the Vogue in mid January. Got a very good weekend rate though the regular rack rates seemed a little steep. Our room had an entrance foyer which gave the bedroom privacy when answering the door. The room itself was well equipped and spacious with two Queen beds sporting comfortable mattresses and top quality bedding. There is a safe in the room. The large marble bathroom contained both a shower stall and jacuzzi tub though the little 14 inch TV perched above it seemed dated and sort of funny. The lobby has a nice spophisticated cocktail bar area and a comfortable lounge with fireplace. There is also a formal looking restaurant with apparent Italian overtones but we did not eat there. Your room entry swipe card also operates the elevators for added security. The neighbourhood is safe and convenient, half way between St. Catherine Street and Sherbrooke Street with Ogilvy's across the street and the clubs of Crescent street are one block over. Also nearby is the Musee des Beaux Arts, Holt Renfrew and the Ritz Carlton. Staff were pleasant, obliging and competent and nothing seemed to be too much of a bother. The Vogue is neither a hive of activity nor the soul of mirth but is a very well run, well furnished, quiet and comfortable hotel in a good location which should suit mature, discerning travellers. Recommended."
142,1455,"Mar 3 2006	Beautiful Hotel	My boyfriend and I and another couple stayed at the Loews Vogue from Feb. 2-6. Staff, location, and rooms were great. The bed was so comfortable I could have slept for days. Bathrooms are huge with bath &amp; shower. Cleaning staff did a great job. Location was excellent for bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. My only complaint is that hotel parking per night is rather expensive. Better off parking at the lot next door. I would definately return to this city and hotel in a heartbeat."
143,1455,"Jan 6 2006	Great Hotel !	My boyfriend and I stay at Lowes Hotel Vogue during Dec 16th thru 23rd 2005. We both loved the hotel. The staff was great, the concierge was even better and the bartenders were friendly and engaging. We had an average size room on the 8th floor and the room was very quiet and had a large bathroom. The only complaint we both had was the restaurant in the hotel which was not so great. The hotel is not too far from the airport (about 30 minutes) and is centrally located to fine shopping, museums and restaurants. We went during the winter which is cold and snowing but we both found the snow to be beautiful and it made it feel like Christmas. If you go during the winter make sure to take a good coat!The people are very friendly and if you speak French they will love you but dont be worried if you dont because everyone we met spoke English. The city is also very gay friendly and has a great gay section called the Latin Quarter. I also suggest you visit Old Montreal, Montreal Casino (they have a great restaurant there). We loved the city and plan to return in the summer."
144,1455,"Dec 11 2005	Great Stay!	My boyfriend and I had a two night stay in this lovely suite. I would recommend this hotel for a romantic getaway or for an extended weekend. I would recommend parking at the green P parking, its right next to the hotel. It was $40 to park there (from Saturday to Monday). We just parked the car when we arrived and walked everywhere, it was in a great location where everything was around. I have heard that it is expensive to park at the hotel.When traveling to Montreal again I would stay at this hotel again."
145,1455,"Dec 11 2005	Exquisite	What an exquisite Hotel the Vogue is. The rooms are simply beyond luxurious. The bathrooms something befitting a royal. I went to Montreal to shop and check out the restaurants. I felt guilty every moment out of the room. Excellent location for shopping and restaurants. It was made especially nice after a stay at the Hotel W ....... a trendy boutique hotel in old Montral which would be more suitable a film version of the Matrix part 15I had ordered a non smoking room at the Hotel W. I have chronic sinusitis so often have no sense of smell. I double checked when I got there to be sure the room was non smoking. A non smoking room wasn't available so I had to come back a few hours later. Then, dispensing with the front desk banter, I went to the room and crashed. Only to die later. There were ashtrays everywhere, Solution? I checked out and went to the Vogue. No racket, no fuss, no complaints. I will simply never go back to the W again."
146,1455,"Nov 30 2005	What a Room!!	My family and I visited Montreal last December and decided to choose Hotel Vogue because of all the positive reviews given about it. It was a bit more expensive than the average hotel rate but it was definitely worth it! The room was amazing with a beautiful canopy bed and nice vanity. The best part was the large marble bathroom with jacuzzi. It was nice to come home to after walking outside in the snow all day. The service was great. Small issues were that the view was nothing special since it is not a tall building, it wasnt in the heart of downtown but relatively close, and we didnt receive complimentary bottled water as advertised. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
147,1455,"Nov 21 2005	A great Hotel but...	I really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars. In all my travels to Montreal ( quite a number of them), this is the nicest hotel that I have stayed at but...I booked a package online directly from the hotel website- price was amazing- got suspicious that something was wrong when my email confirmation did not reflect the package that I had selected. Called the hotel and was told by Sarah the reservations manager that the package that I thought that I had booked did not exist ( luckily I had cut and pasted the information in an email)and for an additional $20, she would upgrade us to a bed and breakfast package, but basically I was a liar. Called the corporate headquarters and lets just say that they straightened it out.Room was ready early, was beautiful- great spa tub and huge bathroom, luxurious bedding, more updated than the Ritz.We came back to our room in the evening to find champagne, fruit and even a birthday cake for me ( almost all part of our package). Concierge got our dinner reservations done perfectly and even complimented us on our choices- but was unable to get us one restaurant we wanted.But they did not clean our room the first day.And it took three tries to figure out what breakfast was included with our package ( we had a dinner included but opted not to use it).Bottom line, would come back to this hotel for the location and the rooms, but you need to stand your guns and look past the fact that it seems to have a few disconnects in staffing and communication process."
148,1455,Nov 10 2005	I made an excellent choice... we loved it	I took my boyfriend to Montreal for his 30th birthday. we stayed at this wonderful hotel. the first class service at front desk was great. they provided us with servicing our room 2 times a day. the concierge agents were very helpful and they made our trip very special. the only thing that I wish it was better it was the lobby of the hotel which was very small. overall the hotel was excellent
149,1455,"Nov 1 2005	Wonderful in every way	My fiance and I spent 3 nights in Montreal, staying at the Hotel Vogue. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. I was concerned about street noise, as that was mentioned in some reviews. Our room, while on the second floor and overlooking the street (as I think all the rooms do) was very, very quiet. I can imagine in the summer when there's more street activity late at night, noise could be a problem. The weather was chilly so not too many people hanging out late at night. The concierge was outstanding and gave excellent restaurant recommendations as well as directions. The hotel is very comfortable -- great bed and pillows, lovely bathroom, and great valet service with our car. Also, we found the location excellent. We walked the city and liked being downtown with clubs, the park, and restaurants nearby. I highly recommend the Vogue."
150,1455,"Oct 31 2005	It doesn't get better than this!	We stayed at this hotel from 10/27 to 10/30 after a cruise on Crystal. This hotel was like a continuation of the cruise. We had a wonderful room with stall shower, whirlpool bath in tub, 3 phones, 3 large windows, and an extremely comfortable bed. The room was very large and beautifully decorated. This is a rather small hotel located in downtown Montreal. There are numerous shops and restaurants nearby, museums and movies within walkind distance. The subway is 1 block away as is the entrance to the underground mall. Two restaurants we enjoyed nearby were Eggspectation and Pain Dore, both within one or two blocks and only open for breakfast and lunch. There is also a good delicatessen called Reuben's about two blocks away on St. Catherine St. After a cruise we do not want fancy food but there were many fine retaurants in the neighborhood too. The concierge was very helpful in giving us directions as well as suggestions as we were looking for particular purchases. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The price of the hotel is not cheap but much less expensive than comparable boutique hotels in another big city like New York. We have traveled all over the world and stayed at many great places but I thought this was outstanding . May I suggest that if you book here you join Loew's Frequent stay club. It is free and entitles you to certain perks like newspapers and a fruit bowl when you arrive."
151,1455,"Oct 27 2005	Most wonderful hotel in the world	I have stayed at hotels all over the world, and I cannot say that I have ever had a better experience than the one I had at the Loews Hotel Vogue. Beautiful rooms, first-rate service and excellent location. The beds are extremely comfortable and well-dressed. The bathrooms are spotless and luxurious -- complete with TV set. Certainly one of the finest hotels in the world to compliment this wonderful city. Other people have commented about the noise, but it was not an issue for me: I live in New York City, and, as in any city, I'm sure there is noise here and there, but don't let this deter you from staying here: It is truly wonderful."
152,1455,"Oct 24 2005	Hotel Vogue: Magnifique...Splendide...Fantastique!!!	Just returned from a two night stay at the Hotel Vogue this past weekend. I couldn't have been more pleased. Upon our arrival, we were informed at checkout that we would be upgraded to a premium room with an oversized bath. Well, it was glorious. The jacuzzi tub was huge and totally surrounded with marble. There were ample towels, and lovely touches like the TV mounted on the vanity top and live plants.. not only in the bathroom, but the entire bedroom/living area as well. I mentioned at check-in that I was taking my fiancee' for a surprise birthday weekend in Montreal and they, without hesitation offered to send up a birthday cake, on the house! It happened to arrive when he was in the shower, so that was even better and a nice treat! I highly recommend joining the &quot;Loews First&quot; program before you arrive. They will bring you some nice goodies in the room and keep track of your general preferences. We had a package that included a &quot;continental Breakfast&quot; which usually just included coffee, juice and pastries. That was not the case. We were allowed to order a full size breakfast instead..another nice surprise. I did not hear a single peep of at night, so I was very confused by the other reviewers complaining about the excess noise. Our room was on the top floor facing front. The negatives all seemed to be around the same week, so maybe it was a fluke. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was very spacious and tastefully decorated. The location was fantastic. Just a quick stoll to all the cute restaurants on Crescent street, as well as St. Catherines. We will be sure to make the Vogue our home away from home in Montreal in the future."
153,1455,"Sep 27 2005	Quelles belles chambres	The rooms at the Vogue are the nicest in the city. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite but saw other rooms at the hotel also. Even the most basic room is spacious and all have jacuzzi tubs. Very clean and comfortable. We had no noise problem at all but did ask for a quiet room. Staff was very nice for the most part, some wait staff seemed a bit stuffy. Location was very nice, close to shopping on St Catherine st, and only a couple of blocks to the underground city and metro lines. Overall, a very comfortable stay at a beautiful property."
154,1455,"Aug 25 2005	spoiled rotten	When we arrived at the Vogue we ended up upgrading our room for only $50 more(cdn). What a great decision!! We ended up in a suite with a living room, dining room, kitchen, huge master bedroom (with the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on!) a marble bathroom with an enormous jacuzzi and television etc etc etc. We were never so spoiled!! The rest of the hotel was just as fabulous and the staff were efficient courteous and knowledgeable. From the bellman to the concierge to the bartenderO'MN to the front desk staff everyone was fabulous. This is what a luxury hotel is all about. Also someone here suggested signing up as a preferred customer on their website- what a great idea!! It worked very well for us!!"
155,1455,"Aug 22 2005	highly recommend this hotel!	this past weekend was my 10th stay at this hotel ( at least) within the last year and a half! I do not feel you can find a better deal in Montreal! The location is perfect as is the entire staff. Each time I arrive, I am warmly welcomed and greeted by name. It takes me 10 minutes to finish saying all of my hello's to the staff. That friendliness alone will keep me a loyal guest. The concierge's Louis -Felipe and Joseph are wonderful and will go out of their way to make your stay memorable, from getting a window table at the best St. Laurent st. restaurants to VIP lists at the clubs, they can make it happen. On one of my previous stays, I asked one of the doormen where i might be able to get a car washed... he did give me directions, however it was farther than i wanted to drive..the next morning when i was leaving to drive home, my car pulled out up front... washed, they had washed it for me in the parking garage!! I call that service. This past weekend, I found a small &quot;gift bag&quot; on my armrest, some fresh cookies, bottled water and some fruit for my ride back to NewYork along with a personally signed thanks you note from the hotel manager. Each time, they manage to extend the red carpet further and further! Personally, i have never had an issue with the noise, like others have written about. For anyone looking for a great location, this is the place, you can find decent rates all the time, join the Loews First club and you get lots of nice stuff after a few stays. If anyone travels with their pets... this is a super friendly pet hotel!!"
156,1455,"Aug 18 2005	Nothing less of superb!	My bf and I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue for 4 days last week. I must say, this is the best hotel I've stayed at so far. Our room was very nicely decorated with warm colors and a really awesome 4 poster queen size bed with pillowtop mattress, down comforters and comfy pillows. The bathroom is almost as big as the room itself! Separate whirlpool tub and glass shower. It even has a tv in the bathroom which was a very nice touch. Service was top knotch and location can't be beat!!! 1 block to your left is St. Catherines where all the shops are, 1 block to your right is Crescent where all the restaurants, clubs, bars, etc. It's really off of the main street so it's nice and quiet. I've had such a positive experience that I will ONLY stay at this hotel when I go back to Montreal! I loved it that much and I don't say that often."
157,1455,"Aug 4 2005	Noisy but Nice	I second the previous rvw. I had a room on the 6th floor, far away from the Club across the street, but still heard base thumping until 2 am.The front desk did say that they were replacing all of the front windows &quot;soon&quot; to deal w/ the noise issue so one might want to inquire about this before staying here.The other reviews are pretty accurate in describing the hotel, especially about Jacques &amp; Philip being great concierges. Try to avoid the other guy unless you want a stuffy Frenchman. Also, note that it is an old building and that the nice lobby is not representative of this entire hotel.Dont forget to eat at Chez L'Epecerie while in Montreal."
158,1455,"Aug 3 2005 	Serious noise problem	Light sleeper avoid this hotel! I can't see why this hotel is still in buisness if no one can sleep at night. We stayed for buisness 6 rooms in total and all had trouble sleeping at night during the week. The management seems aware of it, but really don't do nothing about it ,only saying with a fake smile &quot;we will assigned you a room facing the back for you next stay&quot;. Ya!right won't give me back my 4 nights in hell trying to sleep and I will never come back anyway! Yes the hotel is really nice and the staff is young and wonderfull and the bathroom are amazing but that's it. I could have sleep in my car and it would be more quiet!"
159,1455,"Aug 1 2005	I would give it a 4 if it wasn't so noisy!	We just came back from 3 nights at the Hotel Vogue in Montreal. Chose this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and requested a quiet room away from the noise. We ended up on the 9th floor and were pleased with everything except the not so quiet music from the rooftop of the Hotel De La Montagne up the street. The music was extremely loud and didn't stop till 1:30 or 2 in the morning. After walking around town the entire day, it would have been nice to be able to get a good night's sleep. I mentioned it to the front desk during check out and they said that they are planning to install new windows in the hotel to block out the noise.The only other issue was the time we returned to our room to discover that housekeeping neglected to shut the door (luckily, nothing was missing). Aside from the above, the Hotel Vogue was very nice. Our premium room was spacious, the bathroom was huge and very clean. We loved the jacuzzi tub and the TV in the bathroom. The rooms could have been a little sunnier but I guess you can't expect that from a city hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our flight was cancelled from NY the night before due to weather and management did not charge us for the late cancellation. We were celebrating a special occasion and they sent us a surprise cake. Very nice touch! The flowers that my husband ordered were also very beautiful. The location is good for a first time visit since it is central to everything. If you are a shopaholic, this is a great location."
160,1455,"Jul 29 2005	Nice hotel in the downtown area	We stayed in a 7th floor room overlooking the street. It was very noisy on Saturday night. Which included a drunken medley of Bon Jovi songs, sung by a pack of twenty something girls. I can only wonder if they were also wearing acid washed jeans. Sunday through Wednesday it was relatively quite except for an occasional siren. The beds were comfortable and we slept quite well. My wife commented that the room seemed damp, but the town was in a middle of a heat wave, with very high humidity. The room was directly across from the elevators, but we never heard them. Overall the hotel and staff were very accommodating. The location is not very convenient if you are interested in exploring Vieux Montreal."
161,1455,"Jul 26 2005	Nice hotel during the day  but impossible to sleep at night	The hotel Vogue is really nice, large rooms, superb bathroom almost larger than the room itslef, TV in the bathroom, separate shower, jacuzzi bath . . . Very good location , close to everything that Montreal as to offer. BUT the noise at night is terrible. I think the windows are made of plastic. I was on the 8th floor facing the street and I could clearely hear everything from young drunk kids talking and screaming all night long to police or ambulance cars to trafic jam at 3am-4am! And the hotel across the street has a club on the roof, so live music until 1h30-2am, grrrrr And also I heard all night long the elevators going up and down by the ventilation system, like if a train was passing by. I was moved to another room in the morning facing the back, but that was not more quiet as other reviews said here... I was facing the back alley of the hotel on the 6th floor and garbage trucks was passing by, making so much noise with picking up trash from other buildings around, the hotel parking or another parking entrance was right above the hotel building everytime a car was coming out or in they had to blow the horn. I think I had 3-4 hours of sleeping in 3 nights.I understand it's not a resort in the middle of no where, but I would think that in 2005 , an hotel like the vogue would have soundproof windows!So if you plan not to sleep in beautifull Montreal, stay at the Vogue!! I would love to return, it's a really good hotel with very friendly and professional staff, but why going in a hotel if we canot sleep!?"
162,1455,"Jul 22 2005	Just Wonderful	We stayed at the Vogue July 16 thru 19, and we loved it. It was very clean and the rooms were spacious -- loved the bathroom with the whirlpool tub and modern shower stall. Hubby was impressed with the TV in the bathroom complete with remote control! The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Maid service was perfect, including turn-down service with chocolates at night. We made our reservation thru Hotwire, and I became a member of Loew's First club by signing up online before our stay. When we checked in, they upgraded us to a deluxe room, gave us our preferred amenities (fruit &amp; water), and we got the USA today in the morning. We shouldn't have gotten those perks with a Hotwire reservation, but they gave it to us anyway.The lobby bar was the perfect place to relax after a day of sightseeing. The windows look out on the street and you can watch the people go by. It was very warm in Montreal while we were there, and we really appreciated the air conditioning in the hotel.The concierge recommended the Europa and the Taj restaurants, both of which were excellent. Europa is right down the street and the food and service were incredible. We did the tasting menu with the wine pairings. It was even better than the Inn at Little Washington in our area. The Taj was an Indian restaurant that was top notch, and they had a tasting type menu called &quot;the feast&quot;. Of course no visit to Montreal is complete without eating breakfast at &quot;Eggspectations&quot; -- its right up the street from the Vogue.I definitely recommend the Vogue, but agree with other reviewers that its best to request a room away from the main street. Our room faced the parking lot, and it was very quiet."
163,1455,"Jul 19 2005	Lived Up to High Expectations	Based on the many strong reviews on Trip Advisor, I selected the Vogue for my first visit to Montreal. So glad I did, because this is an exceptional property. As others have noted, rooms are sizeable, lovely and clean and the bathrooms are incredible! Staff very polished and professional, but also warm and friendly. The Vogue manages to pull off that difficult combination of sophistication and warmth, so a guest can enjoy elegant surroundings without being subjected to stuffy attitudes.I actually stayed in two different rooms because there was a problem with the shower in the first room I occupied. On discovering the problem, I was quickly and cheerfully moved to another room that was equally nice and in fact a bit larger.As urban hotels go, the Vogue is pretty quiet. However, if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back of the hotel. My first room was in the back, and I never spent a more quiet evening in a city hotel. When I moved, it was to a room in the front and I did notice some increase in street noise, especially on Friday night when late-night revelers were disbursing from the clubs on nearby Crescent Street.The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to great shopping, several museums, many excellent restaurants and a metro stop nearby. The three-day combo pass for museums/metro is a great value at $39 CA and you can purchase it at many locations. Two wonderful restaurants within a short walk of the Vogue are Europeaand L' Autre Season. I had memorable meals at both places. Outstanding advice on restaurants and other questions was provided by a very personable concierge, Louis Phillipe.If you are headed to Montreal, give the Vogue a try! I'm now among the numerous fans of this very lovely hotel."
164,1455,"Jul 18 2005	Great location nice hotel - but noisy	This is a very nice hotel in an excellent location - - just make sure to ask for a room that does NOT face the street (particularly if you are on a low floor). Montreal nightlife is very active and the street that the hotel faces is an active thoroughfare for two-way traffic and pedestrians. Since the hotel is surrounded by restaurants/clubs - -there is a steady flow of people and honking horns all night long. Do yourself a favor, ask for a room that doesn't face the street (front) of the hotel.Other than that, the hotel was lovely, the people were nice and the location was excellent."
165,1455,"Jul 12 2005	Great little hotel.	Recently stayed at the Loews based on TripAdvisor reviews and were not dissapointed. We took advantage of a bed and breakfast package that also included parking. Our room was spacious, nicely appointed and clean. We had a canopied queen bed which was elegant and comfortable but we should have chosen an uncanopied king for the extra room. The room had an interior view and only one window so during the day there was not much light. The bathroom was one of the nicest I have seen at any price with marble countertops, jacuzzi, tv, separate shower and very spacious. Robes included. The only downside to this room beside the lack of light was it's proximity to the elevator. When all was quiet you could hear the elevator going up and down although it was only a minor distraction. Joseph, the concierge was fabulous and directed us to some excellent reataurants. The hotel is centrally located to a variety of retail stores, restaurants, and clubs. There was always plenty to do and we were able to walk everywhere even to Old Montreal. The location of the hotel was one of the reasons we chose it and we were not dissapointed. The hotel supplied two computers with unlimited internet access if you did not want to pay for it in your room. For your information they will change your American money into Canadian but not the other way around. Also keep your itemized receipts over $50.00 and you can get a partial tax refund at the border.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed Montreal and the Loews Hotel Vogue which we would recommend to anyone."
166,1455,"Jul 11 2005	Very nice boutique hotel (with some elevator problems)	This is a lovely hotel. We had a premium room, which was perfect for us (my husband and I were traveling w/ our 16-month-old daughter). There was plenty of room for a crib in the entryway part of the room-- allowed us to watch a movie after our daughter went to bed. The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable, and the bathroom was enormous. Loved that there was a whirlpool tub.Room service breakfast was good, and the concierge suggested a restaurant within walking distance that was good for our family (read: casual and on the slightly noisy side, but with good food). The one problem we encountered was that there was a fire alarm that went off as we prepared to leave. There was an announcement that it was a false alarm, but the elevators did not work for half an hour at least. We were on the 7th floor with a stroller, so just walking downstairs was not a great option. We called the front desk and were told that the elevators would be working in &quot;about a minute&quot;, but that didn't happen; when we asked for help w/ our luggage it took quite a while for anyone to get there. I am not blaming the hotel for the fact that the fire alarm went off and the elevator didn't work-- that's what's supposed to happen when there's an alarm-- but I do wish they could have given us an accurate estimate of how long things would take and that they had sent someone to help us with the bags more quickly. I am still giving it 5 stars because otherwise, it was great (and reasonably priced, too) but I hope they can get their staff a little better at customer service during a problem like this."
167,1455,"Jul 6 2005	The Absolute Best...	What do you say about a top notch, first class hotel in the best area of Montreal???? Our room was an executive suite which I happen to snag at $233 pn Canadian and was magnificent will a full dining area and a whirlpool tub and 2 bathrooms..my husband naturally got the smaller one!! TV's everywhere, including my bathroom..turn down service with chocolates..who wouldn't love this??? The head concierage, Joseph, was an absolute delight, extremely knowledable, and helpful, as was every one else..Loved the surrounding area with Ogilvy's Dept. Store across the street..kind of like a Neiman Marcus with superior merchandise..great walking area and you won't be sorry staying here and will thank me endlessly if you take this recommendation..enjoy...I will be a returning customer...."
168,1455,"Jul 1 2005	Fantastic Stay	We stayed at the Vogue for 3 nights at the end of June and had a wonderful time. The service was exceptional - we called for ice and a pair of scissors and had both items within 5 minutes. The hotel staff was extremely pleasant and genuinely nice to our two dogs, who were treated as honored guests, greeted by name by the doormen. We only saw one other dog there, a standard poodle.I would have liked to have wifi internet access available in our room, but there was free internet in the business center off the lobby. The room itself was comfortable and spotless (even with two doggies in residence). We walked the city endlessly and were very sore at the end of the day - so the jetted bath with attached tv were a nice way to relax at the end of the day. Location was great, within walking distance to everywhere, including the Vieux Port, although that was a pretty substantial hike, about 30-45 minutes. Part of the route we took was in the Underground City, which was pretty fun to navigate.Only gripes were about Montreal itself: hideously expensive ($12 for a four pack of Smirnoff Ice at the local liquor store), aggressive beggars (one woman assaulted us with a drunken request for money while we were eating in an outdoor cafe), crowded even on a weekday. Made me happy to cross the bridge back to NY.I would definitely stay at another Loews hotel again. Was very impressed by the level of service and quality of the hotel."
169,1455,"Jun 3 2005	Highly Recommend the Vogue	I am a native Montrealer who has friends stay at the Vogue twice yearly, usually for 10-12 days/trip. They can afford to stay anywhere in the city but choose the Vogue because of the exceptional service and prime location. Hey right across the street from Ogilvy's, who would not be happy? Since they recently had a baby, the hotel was only too happy to provide a crib &amp; basinette. I also believe small pets are welcome. And be sure to check out Francine's wicked martinis in the bar - they rock. There's something to be said when the concierge &amp; doormen all greet you by name &amp; you don't even stay there. Or they wave when you drive by because they recognize you or your car. And on a professional note, my firm holds many corporate events &amp; the Vogue is one of our preferred venues for meetings &amp; accommodating out of town guests. The Vogue may not be the most stylish or trendy hotel in Montreal, but I'd be hard pressed to find a better-located hotel. On de La Montagne (Mountain Street) one block south &amp; one block north of the hotel, there is a restaurant every 5 steps &amp; so many of them are worth checking out (Rosalie, Da Vinci, Katsura to name a few), one block West is Crescent (bars galore, also fine restaurants), shopping across the street at Ogilvy if you like designer names &amp; in prime shopping territory on Ste-Catherine street for shoes, leather/suede, denim &amp; so much more. Also a hop skip &amp; jump away from the Peel or Guy metro stations allowing access to the underground shopping that links the major department stores.For me, the Vogue is 5*+++"
170,1455,"May 30 2005	Top-notch location comfort service etc.	A group of friends and I went to Montreal for a weekend in May, 2005. The leader of the trip arranged a few regular rooms plus a suite at the Loews Vogue. I was a bit nervous about the price, given that there are many less-expensive options in Montreal, and I am typically very budget conscious. But this hotel was worth every penny!It's not a huge hotel, but that translates into very attentive service. Our requests for wine glasses and other random items were met graciously and almost instantaneously. The concierge was able to help with driving directions, dinner reservations, and airport transportation. The maid service was superb. They never disturbed any of us, they were careful not to throw away anything we might not intend to throw away, and one night we returned to the suite to find they had even replenished our ice buckets and replaced our white wines exactly as we left them! As other reviews have noted, the beds are also extremely comfy, the bathrooms are spacious and immaculate, and the location is perfect.When we came down to check out on our last morning, we found the lobby clogged with a busload of new arrivals. Yet the concierge spotted us and ushered us over to his desk to check us out as the main desk dealt with the mammoth group.I wouldn't hesitate for a second to return to this hotel."
171,1455,"Apr 30 2005	A native Montreal chimes in	Stayed at Loews Hotel Vogue for three nights in April. I am a native Montrealer who has been living in the US for 16 years. I travel frequently to Montreal to visit family and friends. Although I have stayed in many of the five-star properties in Montreal such as the Ritz Carlton, Sofitel, Omni, and Hotel Le Germain, I have always preferred the Vogue. Why? Its small, well located, has spacious rooms with comfortable beds and large bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs. Prices are also usually reasonable (check internet for deals, and also check for the AAA rates). Since I also enjoy taking a bath each evening, I like the fact that each bathroom has its own TV. Service is probably the one thing that is not consistent. Room service is quick and when you order toasted bread, it arrives warm instead of cold and hard. Defintiely treat yourself to as many Montreal bagels as you cantheyre the best and have a unique flavor. Be advised that the hotel scene in Montreal is in transition at this point. Ten years ago, there were only a handful of five-star hotels. Now there are a bunch of boutique-style hotels that opened in Old Montreal as well as on the Eastern border of central downtown (e.g., Hotel Godin, Hotel Gault, W Hotel, St. James, Hotel St. Paul). The problem for me with those hotels is their location. Although they are located in nice areas of Montreal, they are not centrally located to the central area of downtown where most of the shopping is. On the other hand, nothing beats Old Montreal in the summer. Words of warning: Ritz Carlton has beautiful public spaces, but rooms are not up to Ritz standards. The Omni used to be a Four Seasons and the rooms still have the same scratched and tattered furnishings form when Four Seasons gave it up back in the 80s. Rooms were also not well cleaned. Le Germain is a great property and I highly recommend it. The only thing is that their prices usually run about $50 more a night then the Vogue. Enjoy this beautiful city!"
172,1455,"Apr 23 2005	Perfect location and place	Stayed at the Loews in March after a busy business trip.I wanted to have a nice place to rest and to visit some friends living in Montreal. Location is great, no need to have a car. My room was quite spacious and, most important, clean and quiet. Staff was helpful, polite and friendly. The internet free connection at the lobby is very good to check email time to time.The bar is small but warm, if you are looking for a busy bar with people to talk to... Just forget it. The food at the restaurant is nice but not exceptional, there is a menu for lunch and one for diner.My only negative point is about a wrong surcharge of a small amount of CAN$, they got this small amount of money from my credit card after my check out. The so called charge was a drink took at the bar... How strange... At the same hour I was in my plane... I was quite surprise but I didn't complained it, if I call them or send a letter, it will probably cost the same amount of money after a while.Except this mistake, my stay was very comfortable and pleasant."
173,1455,"Apr 20 2005	Wonderful Hotel!	My mom and I just got back from Montreal yesterday and I'd like to report that we had a very nice time. Loews Hotel was everything I'd hoped it would be: centrally located, full of helpful, knowledgeable staff, clean. I booked this last minute trip through site59 and had requested a double bed room. When we arrived, we found that we had a king sized bed room. The woman at the front desk informed me that unfortunately they had no more double room available that night but would change us to a proper room the following day. Apparently &quot;internet bookings&quot; (3rd party bookings) don't always thoroughly communicate everything you request to the hotel. For the first night, they brought in a rollaway bed and it was fine, no big deal. They had the correct room ready for us first thing in the morning. Can I just say that the bathrooms were fabulous! They were large, had a separate whirlpool tub, separate shower, everything was in marble. I can understand if one stays in a deluxe room costing an arm and a leg each night one might expect this but these where their regular rooms (and we saw two rooms both of which had the great bathrooms). Mind you, most of us don't plan on spending our vacations in the bathroom but it sure was a plus!The location was perfect. We were just a few blocks from a metro station, tons of shopping was all around us. We were within easy walking distance to the Musee des Beaux-Arts (great temporary Egyptian exhibit by the way). The lady at the concierge desk was also very helpful in our planning of a day trip to Quebec City.We would certainly stay there again!"
174,1455,"Apr 10 2005 	Hotel Vogue just gets BETTER and BETTER!	I travel frequently to Montreal on business and am not the type of person to stay at only one hotel. Well, it's getting hard NOT to pick Hotel Vogue and ONLY Hotel Vogue for Montreal stays.It's an elegant hotel without being snooty about it. The emphasis is on comfort and privacy.There really are no downsides to the hotel though, I admit, I have never parked my car here (I usally fly in and take taxis around the city). So, I can't attest, one way or the other, to the state on on-site parking.The gym is good, the small bar is nice (though it gets smoky quite quickly), the food is good and the service - well, the service is what you would expect from a Loews Hotel.Prices fluctuate here, seemingly dependent upon season and the hotel's caprice. Check the Loews website frequently. Usually, I'll end up booking somewhere else, then fining a nice deal here the week of my arrival.So, this place is a can't miss. It's not among my favourite hotels in the world, but it is, to me, among the tope here in my native Canada."
175,1455,"Apr 8 2005	Great Stay at the Loews	I stayed at the Loews Montreal after a week skiing at Mont Tremblant. It was myself and 3 children. I had a one bedroom suite which had a bedroom with a king bed and a connected living room with a queen sofa bed and a huge dining room table. The master bath had a beautiful marble jacuzzi tub for two and a TV but no shower. The bathroom that was in the living room had a shower only. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Great linens and comforter. The kids were very comfortable on the sofa bed and we got a roll-a-way for the third. It was like a regular bed, not some cheap fold up job. The location is great as the other reviews state. The staff could not have been nicer. They sent up cards for a free movie or video game rental for each of the kids and there was a bottle of Canadian ice wine (in an ice bucket) waiting for me. The concierge was very helpful with directions and recommending kid friendly place to eat. When we were leaving and the valet brought up my car there was a bag with 4 bottles of water and 4 apples. A nice touch I thought.I have stayed in high end hotels and resorts all over the world. I would say that the room was as nice as anyplace I have stayed and the staff and the extras made this one of the most enjoyable places I have ever stayed.I would highly recommend this hotel and I will definately stay there again."
176,1455,"Mar 27 2005	Luxurious Room 	If you're looking for a great place to stay in the heart of Montreal, THIS IS IT!! It is centrally located on the intersection of St.Catherines and Montagne flooded with restaurants, bars, clubs, stri clubs, stores and boutiques (ranging from desginer names to dollar stores.) If you're seeking the Night Life, the street parallel (Cresent) to the hotel are lined up with bars and clubs that off, er extensive happy hour.Check In: We arrived at the hotel and the Valet Service took our car. We were able to check in 2 hours early with no extra charge. B e aware that parking costs 30/night without tip and tax. There were no lines in the lobby area and the concierge was extremely friendly. The security is a bit strict though. To ride the elevator you have to use your room key and you can only access the floor in which your room is on. You also need the room key to acccess different hallways to get to your room.Room: The room was beautiful. Big enough for 2 people. The closet was huge and the lighted vanity mirror was an excellent touch. I couldnt stay out of the jetted tub for two especially when there was a tv in the bathroom. The bed has very soft and luxurious linens, I felt like i was sleeping on clouds. Unlike other reviews I have read, there were no loud noises heard from outside. The street was very quiet. Maybe it is because Spring Break was over. The lounge: Very NICe but expensive. The bartender was very friendly. We got free biscuits and cheese with our martinis that cost 33.00 for two apple martinis.Overall, the hotel was extremely nice for the rice, (we paid about 126 US through expedia) but the extra services did cost a lot more!"
177,1455,"Mar 3 2005	Best I've found so far...	I stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue at the end of February 05, and found the hotel to be best so far. I've stayed at the Hotel Nelligan and Hotel St. Paul and found everything about the Vogue to be better. I had a junior suite, which had two full bathrooms and room was spacious. The beds here are great. Room service arrived in less than 30 minutes. There can be a problem with street noise from the club crowd, but since it was winter that really wasn't that noisy. I was never awaken from it. Resturant food was very good, but a little pricey, but for the downtown location that's to be expected. If you like the Loews, look into their Loews Reward program."
178,1455,"Mar 2 2005	Could have been better..alot better!!	I recently stayed at the Loews...I thought it would be convenient because it was downtown..it was convenient but the noise was annoying...being in the heart of downtown has it disadvantages!! Every morning..honk,honk,honk..this is supposed to be our vacation!! Service was good..a lack of helpful ideas..not strong concierge services..room was nice and spacious..but was like all the big name hotels!! It was alright but next time maybe its time to try Montreal's boutique hotels. Would I recommend the Loews..probably not."

Had bottled water &amp; apples in our car for the ride back home. Very pleasant time at the Vogue."
180,1455,"Feb 24 2005	friendly beautiful romantic	i can honestly not find a single thing to complain about. the lobby is too small? not grandiose enough? that's about it, and that absolutely doesn't matter. everything went perfectly. the location is great, right between maisonneuve and st. catharines. the front desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.the room was absolutely gorgeous. beautiful bed (we didn't have a canopy, but next time i'd love to) with the softest down comforter and great pillows. the bathroom was lovely, with the jacuzzi tub (big enough for two people, but not exactly comfortable for two because of the faucet) and separate shower.i paid $199 CAD a night, which included valet parking and breakfast for 2, which we had delivered via room service. i thought it was pretty reasonable, considering i made the reservation 2 nights before the stay on the hotel site and not on a discount site.the staff were all incredibly friendly and professional, from the valet parker to the guy that brought us ice. if you consider what you'd pay to stay at the sheraton or the delta, i think this is a much better value for your money. probably an average of $20 more, but well worth it."
181,1455,"Jan 18 2005	Awesome bed Great Hospitality	Just stayed here this past weekend. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I would stay here again or at any other loewes hotel. The hotel vogue is charming and in a great location. The staff is all about great service. The concierge was most helpful Mr. Louis Phillipe Talbot made reservations for us at a fabulous restaurant, gave us driving directions and tips about the city and recommendations for the nightlife. Everyone that works here is friendly and hospitable but best of all was the bed. we stayed in a room with a queen canopy bed. This is one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in as well the duvet and linens were awesome. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. A++++++Oh while we were there we did look at a couple of the hotels that were options for us hotel st. james, xixe sielce and the place d'arms and i am glad that we chose the loewes i felt that we got what we paid for and more."

183,1455,"Nov 30 2004	Would stay again in a heartbeat!	Just returned from a 4-night stay at the Loews Hotel Vogue. I was visiting Montreal for medical reasons and was therefore not able to do much sightseeing but appreciated the central location of the hotel. The spacious non-smoking room on the 7th floor provided a great environment for convalescing. Comfortable bed, beautiful linens. The bathroom was gigantic and about 4x bigger than the one in a Quebec City hotel I stayed at later in the week. Lighted makeup mirror, jacuzzi, TV near tub, separate shower...room done in marble.I got a rate of $152.19 CA by booking the room on the hotel's web site, and I'm looking forward to staying here again for my follow-up visits. The staff was wonderful."
184,1455,Nov 15 2004	Expensive.... but worth every penny	I can only say this - WOW. This hotel blew me away and I am VERY picky. I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this place. It's top notch all around. I will certainly say the room is the most beautiful I've stayed in - and the TV in the bathroom was such a unique touch! Just LOVED this hotel. No wonder it's the hotel of choice for visiting celebs like Brad Pitt.One downside - parking. It's valet parking ONLY and it runs you $30 a day (plus a tip everytime you have someoen fetch your car). You can find lots in the area at about $15 a day. It's a real drag - but not unusual for a downtown hotel.
185,1455,"Nov 7 2004	Lovely hotel in a beautiful city	This is in a perfect location in central Montreal (a lot of other hotels are nearby too though). I had an executive suite. Two entrances, a kitchenette area, dining room area, living room, two desk workstations, two bathrooms (one with a shower, one with a jacuzzi and small color TV), two closets, a vanity area and the bedroom. The bed was superb. I had three-courses of room service, which was very good, although my main dish (a pizza) was a bit oily, dessert was great. The workout room was better than average (several machines, all of which work...which seems to never be the case at hotels...). Staff was very friendly. My only complaint is that I didn't have a view - I look out the back of the hotel at an alley and backs of other buildings.Other reviews mentioned that it was noisy. I was woken up at 3am by some drunks yelling in French. But this is a city, noise happens in cities and I'm fine with it - was not a big deal to me.The only thing I would consider knocking down the rating for would be the view, but I have stayed in several hotels in Montreal and none of them have had views except for the Hilton - and the Hilton was just gross in the room...I'd rather have no view and luxury."
186,1455,"Oct 28 2004	Very comfortable	I got a great rate of $179.00 Canadian (US145.00) through Destina for one night. The room was large with a fourposter bed,a dressing area and a big cosy bathroom with jacuzzi and seperate shower stall. Free newspaper and bedside chocolates are included too. Hotel is classy and ideally situated in the middle of everything. I had breakfast in the lovely dining room and it was reasonable at 18.50 Canadian including tax and tip for an excellent full American breakfast with unlimited delicious cups of coffee. Staff are charming and very professional to top off what was for me a perfect stay. Value and quality cannot be beat."
187,1455,"Sep 27 2004	Nice stay	I had a nice stay at the Vogue. The room was very large - about 350 sq. ft. and well decorated. The bathroom was about 50%+ larger than most hotel bathrooms for this class.9 foot high ceilings in the room.The only minor points I would note are that the carpet had a couple of stains near the minibar and was getting a bit worn, the mattress was not pillow top(which I prefer), and most rooms do not have much of a view. On Staturday nights you can hear cars outside (from the front rooms) until quite late. Would stay here again."
188,1455,"Sep 1 2004	Loews Vogue was tops	With a great deal from Travelocity, we decided to visit our neighbor to the north, Montreal Canada. We chose the Loews Vogue, as it was priced below market for an excursion that also included round trip air transportation. From the effortless check-in to checkout, this hotel was just perfect. It is a half block from the main shopping street in Montreal, and very convenient to many fine local restaurants. Our room was certainly deluxe with a king bed and fine cotton linens and down pillows. The all marble bathroom had a teriffic jacquzi as well as a stall shower. The hotel service could not have been more efficient or cordial. Fitness room had a full compliment of machines to help us work off the fine dining to be had in the city. A great, close (less than one hour from LGA) city with an excellent hotel to enjoy it from."
189,1455,"Aug 25 2004	Very Very Classy	Hotel Vogue is a very classy hotel. We are Loews Gold Members so we got a great upgrade without a request. The room was HUGE, dining room, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, 2 entrances! Very comfortable bed. Employees are friendly and the location is perfect. This hotel has true class! It is not a hotel that tries too hard to be a nice hotel like some others with gaudy decor..etc.Very Nice!"

I admit the location is is good, but I felt that the hotel was tired. I feel that the rooms need to be updated with new carpet and a fresh coat of paint. The hotel has great potential, but it needs to be updated. Not what I expected..."
191,1455,"Aug 5 2004	Perfect for First timers to Montreal!!	Let me start by saying that the Loews Vogue was a great location, not only for first timers , but return trips to Montreal , as well. Its perfectly located -easy access to the many areas of Montreal that one would want to explore. The hotel rooms are fabulous-very luxurious and comfortable. The bathroom alone is a reason to stay. Huge double person marble tub with tv and separate stall shower. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only criticism i would say is be sure to do your homework ahead of time of places you want to eat, because i found the concierge to be very general in their recommendations and i didn't get the impression that they had actually experienced many of the places themselves. It almost felt like they were reading from the same descriptions that i was in the travel guides. If you are looking for hip and higher end restaurants, there are many in the Old Montreal area(the Saint Laurent blvd section is considered the &quot;hip&quot; and trendy section, though we found it to be more &quot;fake hip&quot; and the actually good restaurants are in Old Montreal. )There is a fabulous vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown called Pho Bang New York . Its a great city and staying at the Loews Vogue will make going back to your room after a day of sightseeing , something to look forward to."
192,1455,"May 11 2004	They made a resevation mistake...	I have stayed at both the Ritz-Carlton and Hotel St. Paul in Montreal, and the Lowes beats them both. A group of us (8 guys, 4 rooms) went up for a long weekend in May. Upon arriving they had us down for single (king) rooms instead of doubles, even thought I had called to confirm 3 times (including that day). However, the from desk staff was VERY nice and checked into the correct rooms with-in 10 minutes. The hotel is amzing, the lobby is nothing to look at but the rooms and location make up for it. Upon entering the room I could not believe it, nicely decorated, HUGE bathrooms with a TV next to the whirlpool tub! The bedding was also the softest and most comfortable I've ever slept in (I always stay at 4 + star hotels). The location could not have been better, one block from both St Catherine &amp; Cresent streets. The hotel also seems to be very pet friendly (dog treats in our minibar).I have never written about a hotel on any of these sites, I was so pleased with my experience here that I had to take the time to write this review. I stayed in a &quot;standard&quot; room and paid $169 US/night."
193,1455,"May 3 2004	Best in Montreal	I wouldn't call it a Boutique hotel...it's too classic. But it's a really great hotel: Huge bedroom and bathroom, nicely decorated. The service is also great (&quot;the invisible housekeepers&quot;). The location it's perfect as well. Don't look any further...this is the place to stay in Montreal. And it's not that expensive...so it's a good chance to experience a very nice hotel for a fair price."
194,1455,"Apr 14 2004	Perfect except....	Stayed at the Loews Hotel Vogue April 9-11th with my boyfriend for a romatic getaway weekend and it was a great experience. As other reviewers have written the rooms are well appointed, the bedding is wonderful and the bathroom huge. We asked for a quite room and it was (though the view of the parking lot left something to be desired - which would be my only &quot;quasi-complaint&quot;). The people at the front desk were polite, helpful and friendly. The location was excellent (make sure you go to Cora's for breakfast a couple of streets over). We ended up going to dinner one night at &quot;Ristorante Bis&quot; just down the street at 1229 rue de la Montagne on recommendation of the Concierge. The dinning experience ruined our weekend. By accident the waiter spilt red wine all over my boyfriend's clothes, including a sweater he had just purchased in England. The waiter was very apologetic but the manager/owner was extremenely rude to us when we suggested that the dinner be on the house to cover the damages of the ruined clothing (which would have been less than paying for a new sweater). There is NEVER an appropriate occassion to verbally abuse a customer. We are still in the process of sorting out with the restuarant payment for the ruined sweater (as the stains did not come out even after dry cleaning). Even if they do pay, the manner in which we were treated was inexcusable and unacceptable. I ended up in tears that night when I should have been having a romantic evening. So if you are planning to stay in Montreal I highly recommend the Hotel Vogue but stay clear away from Ristorante Bis."

196,1455,"Feb 27 2004	I could live in the bath tub at the vogue hotel	I read the reviews submitted to you about the vogue hotel in montreal. most of the reviewers gave this hotel an excellent review, and i am here to add my name to the list. this is a small boutique hotel with a fabulous location. i requested that no scented cleaning products be used, no scents in the room, and a quiet room away from the elevators...i didn't have to ask twice! the room was beautiful,and the bathtub was amazing....huge! the linens were exquisite, the room was well appointed and incredibly clean. the room service was wonderful...unfortunately, this hotel has no concierge, and the staff did not &quot;step up to the plate&quot;....overall it was a beautiful, well located, incredibly clean hotel...i would definitely recommend it ...thought it was better than the 4 seasons:)"
197,1455,"Feb 25 2004	A gem!	The Vogue is one of my favourite hotels in Montreal. The location is ideal. The bathrooms are fabulously luxurious! We've stayed there twice, and the staff was always very helpful. The atmosphere is very relaxed. Room service is very good. The rooms are a very good size. The beds and bedding are amazing. My boyfriend found the pillow too hard, but apparently you can order softer ones. We also had a humidifier brought up to our room and needle and thread. The first time we went we paid CDN $159 per night and the second time was even less because we paid in advance. You can't get a better deal in Montreal for the quality."

1,1456,"Oct 2 2009 	Nice small hotel in good location	Stayed here for 1 night in September 2009. Had large top floor room with good size bathroom. Room facilities good. Hotel location fine for shops and restaurants. Free continental breakfast - not lots of choice, but you can upgrade to a cooked breakfast for $5. Staff helpful. Wifi fine. Parking on site and chargeable."
2,1456,"Sep 29 2009 	Unsafe Location	If you stay at the Lord Berri, leave your car at home! The hotel does not have its own parking leaving you to park on the street ($17) or in the adjacent lot ($15) - this is where we parked and heard our alarm go off the minute we walked into our room. The hotel is in an unsafe neighbourhood surrounded by crackheads and drunks. Take a cab and be careful. Park underground. Better yet, pick another hotel in a safer area. The hotel itself is clean with minimal services (no gym or pool, bar/grill for food). Would not stay here again."
3,1456,"Sep 11 2009 	Reasonably Good No Frills Hotel	I stayed at the Lord Berri Hotel with a friend for Labor Day weekend 2009. This wasn't my first time in Montreal, so I picked the Lord Berri Hotel because of its great location. It's a couple of blocks from the main bus station, and is one block away from the busy Berri-UQAM Metro Station. Furthermore, bustling rue Ste. Catherine with its restaurants and bars is literally around the corner. The location is also close enough to Old Montreal, Centre Ville (downtown) and other main roads for those inclined to drive around town.The service is good. The welcome upon arrival was very pleasant and friendly. The staff was very helpful to me and my friends (who were not hotel guests) when we had to find a taxi one day very early in the morning. Our room, including the bathroom, was kept clean everyday. The free Wifi service in our room was a great bonus too.The only &quot;negative&quot; to this hotel is that it's pretty old - the furniture and wallpaper are dated - it seems that nothing's been changed in more than 25 years. Nevertheless, everything in the hotel seems to be in good working condition, so if aesthetics aren't a big deal to you, then this hotel is fine.For about US$100 a night on Labor Day weekend, this hotel was a reasonably good place to stay. Lord Berri offers no frills, but it covers the basics (clean room, clean bathroom, adequate towels and toiletries, mini-fridge, working AC) pretty well."
4,1456,"Aug 31 2009 	great little place to stay	Found this hotel through TripAdvisor. Went to Montreal for the Nascar Nationwide Race and found this hotel to be close to everything we needed. 1.6km to the Keg Steakhouse in Old Montreal. A couple blocks to the Metro station which took us right to the track. The room was adequate for what we needed - 2 queen beds. Air conditioning worked and so did the fairly new flat screen.Had to ask for more towels - you'd think they would clue in that we may need more than 3 bath towels and 2 wash cloths when I made the reservation and told them how many were in our travelling party.The parking was a little tight.. The rental car fit fine (Dodge Caliber) but I don't think I would have been able to park my truck in the underground parking. There were cameras in the lot and it was gated so I felt fairly confident in the security. Continental breakfast was included but we didn't partake in it, opting for a heartier breakfast at a local sports bar."
5,1456,"Aug 17 2009 	Decent price nice clean rooms with updated amenities/recently renovated	This place gets an A grade in pretty much every respect from my wife and I. We were a little hestitant booking there based on some of the reviews on this site. Perhaps the hotel has just recently been renovated, or perhaps they have just recently fired older staff, but our experience did not in any way reflect some of the negative reviews posted here. The staff was extremely friendly, going out of their way to help us. The parking was cheap 15 bucks per night and directly next to the hotel. The room was clean and modern with very new looking furniture and flat screen HD television.. The bathroom wasn't huge but had plenty of space and was comfortable. The metro is a less than one minute walk and St. Catherine st. is right there. Could have not have been a more fun trip and could not have been a better spot for the price.Also I saw one of the reviews said that the internet was not free. That is not true. Internet was definitely free."
6,1456,"Aug 11 2009	smelly	The hotel room we stayed in smelled like mildew. Each time we entered the room, it smelled worse. It was very over priced for the room you get. However, the location was good and props to them for trying to revamp an old building. The wireless internet was free, but not very good. It screwed up my computer for a little bit and when it did work, it was very very slow."
7,1456,"Jul 26 2009 	Great Location Good Price Decent Room	I attended the Montreal Jazz Festival so I researched Hotels for hours because I wanted a place close to the festival. The location was fabulous! About 100 yards from St. Catherine street which is alive way into the night. The room was basic but it did have a coffeemaker and fridge, no glasses just plastic cups. The bed was comfortable and the room was very clean. Not a place for a honeymoon, it's pretty basic but if you want a clean, quiet room within walking distance of nightlife and the festival, it's great. Make sure you bring your confirmation, they didn't have our reservation, we booked through Orbitz. Parking: a lot is attached for $15/day. Will defenitely stay there again. Oh, I picked it by the reviews on Trip Advisor, it was the hotel w the least amount of negative comments (for the price range). Thanks Trip Advisor!"
8,1456,"Jul 5 2009 	OK stay for the price	We stayed at the Lord Berri for two nights. It was an average hotel and knowing that it looked old from the pictures I accepted a bit more in terms of renovation. Our room was very old, and did not look at all modern like the pictures on the website. There was a newer large TV but the remote control was not working. The bathroom was very unkempt, it was not cleaned very well and the shower was terrible. It frankly smelled like a public washroom. There were no signs of maintenance in that room. The walls were covered in old wallpaper, there were visible cracks and it was dirty. But we dealt with it and at a $100 a night I guess it was expected. The free breakfast was just an afterthought it seemed. Coffee, and stale old, dry pastries and toast. Nothing to sustain a person, possible a Montreal Bagel would be good. One thing that I didn't expect was the door to the room opening on its own not once but three times ! I wonder if any other guests have had this happen to them. We locked the door behind us and on three occasions we heard the door open. I would look and the door was ajar. It was extremely disconcerting. Has anything strange happened to other guests ? I have researched and have not come up with any stories on so called hauntings.All in all you truly get what you pay for. Please don't pay anymore than $100 a night for this hotel/motel."
9,1456,"Feb 6 2009 	The Lord is Berri GOOD!!!	I've stayed at the Lord Berri 4 times for pleasure and am going back next month. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Montreal! The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean the beds are great. I would definitely ask for a room on the parking lot side because the street side can be noisy. Staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is good, too.The best part of the hotel is the LOCATION. It's 2 blocks from the bus station (where the shuttle from the airport drops you off), one block from the most convenient subway station Berri-UQAM (where 2 or 3 lines cross--very important!), and a block from Sainte Catherine street, one of the most famous streets in the city (for shopping, restaurants, bars, etc.). Right next door is an awesome bookstore (books, music, DVDs) that stays open later than most stores, great for browsing after dinner."
10,1456,"Dec 19 2008 	Not the place to enjoy a romantic weekend	Friendly staff, but located on a grotty busy road in the Latin Quarter.The cosy (small) lobby sadly stunk of frying fat and the place looked rather forlorn. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable and the food edible. Easy access to the Montreal night life. Not the place to enjoy a romantic weekend"
11,1456,"Nov 24 2008 	Close to allGood value for the dollar	We stayed at the Lord Berri for 2 nights during Grey Cup weekend in November in Montreal which is one of Canada's biggest sporting event's.Availability to be located in the party central core of hotel's was very difficult,and so called &quot;special event rates&quot; made it expensive.After researching on Tripadvisor at length,asking people,and calling different hotel property's,I felt comfortable with my decision to book with the Lord.We would only be spending our sleeping hour's in the room.The property is located on the outskirt's of the core in my opinion,but taxi fair's very reasonable,or if weather is co-operating and you enjoy a good walk,it would be within reason to wwalk.Old Montreal by taxi was $5cdn tip in.Crescent street,De la montagne street's,nice upper class eatries,and drinking establishment's were under $10cdn tip in.Bell centre for a Montreal Canadien's Hockey game would be around cdn$10.00 tip in.St Catherine street is around the corner.We at no time felt threatned in any way.and we did walk considerable amount.Location to the subway,public transit was very close.The room had 2 Queen size bed's,a TV,small fridge,and the Bathroom was small,but had toiletries,and was clean.The room's are dated,could use some updating,we were in a room facing Rue Berri,I would suggest the other side,even numbered room's I think,because you could hear car traffic at some time's.Park in the Basement if possible,it is a better option I was told!Coffee,and toast were included with our rate which was cdn119.00 per night+17.00 for parking per night.When you compare that to cdn250-300 per night for a better location,but Double the $.We used a taxi and our food and beverage's were bought with the Monie's saved!If you are looking for a place to rest your head after a day of partying or sightseeing and you don't mind a litlle travel.for the dollar's I thought it was reasonable.it ain't the Ritz,but it was clean, close enough to all,the the rate was reasonable.Friendly staff,good in house restaurant for basic meal's,close to the highway to get in and out of Montreal."
12,1456,"Oct 6 2008 	Lord Berri is OK	We stayed at the Lord Berri for three nights. Good things were its accessibility if you are driving in Montreal for the first time, its underground parking (limited and pricey, but convenient so worth trying to get in), proximity to the Metro station and location near the old port. It also has a decent bar/restaurant and is in a safe area of the city. On the other hand, it didn't impress us overly much, it's a bit anonymous, only one lift goes down to the garage, and it didn't inspire any affection. At about $160 per night for two, it wasn't the greatest value for money."
13,1456,"Jul 29 2008 	GREAT stay at Lord Berri	I truly liked the Lord Berri. How important is the greeting at the front desk? VERY. Veronique greeted me in a very welcoming manner and checked us quickly. She offered the parking garage, and although the price was $7 cheaper next door on the street, I am glad that I took the offer for the parking garage. The garage was clean and a very easy walk to the elevator. Our car seemed much safer in the garage than on the street.We stayed in suite 505. It was really very large: one bedroom, two bathrooms, two closets and a living room. Everything was superior in cleanliness. The furniture was a dark wood. I especially liked the &quot;entertainment center&quot; piece in the living room, and the books on the shelves. One book was the life story of Anne Sexton. Read that story in college.Room included: a safe, a refrigerator, a coffee machine, two air conditioners.Breakfast at the hotel was good. The waiter was very friendly. The restaurant features Italian food, offers a dinner special on mussels ($16.95 ?), and has two wide screens TVs.WIFI access was immediate for $10 for duration of stay. WIFI reception in the room was strong and fast.The maid left lots of supplies and clean towels.University of Quebec at Montreal is directly across the street.Metro stop is a short walk, as is Chinatown and Vieux Montreal.There are a lot of YOUNG beggers / homeless / drug addict kids on St. Catherine Street. Say &quot;desole&quot;, or sorry, and they will live you alone. This hotel appears to be very family friendly. The kids we see in the elevator appear to be happy and enthused with their stay.Nice hotel, great reception at the front desk."
14,1456,"Jul 28 2008 	All is well that ends well!	I'm not usually one to take the time and write reviews, but this time I had to make an exception. My girlfriend and I decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal for a bit of shopping, cultural experience, and a to enjoy the night life. Booking under a week to the date, and on a busy summer weekend, as well as not having any experience in Montreal travel, I was quite worried looking for a reasonable place to stay. Browsing through many other hotels, b&amp;b's, and apartments, I was quite nervous of book a place from many mixed reviews. Price was an issue, but we didnt want to go too cheap at the expense of quality. I settled on the Lord Berri because of a majority of good reviews, appealing website and photos, as well as there own underground parking garage. I highly recommend this hotel with the following key pieces of advice.- Get there early on the day of your reservation, even if your room is not ready, so as to secure a spot in their limited underground parking. It's price is similar to independent street level parking lots, but secure and gives you a piece of mind if you're like us and unfamiliar to the safety of areas within the city. - Book online through the hotel website as they often have deals and I managed to score a really nice room with a queen size bed for only $99.Some addititonal good points of this hotel is: - It's two steps off of St. Catherine street where most of the action is. - Ten/ fifteen minutes walk to major shopping/happening spots.- Right beside a Metro stop which by subway can take you anywhere.- A little quieter than staying a few blocks away on the busiest part of town. - I had read mixed reviews about the staff and rooms, however staff was very helpful and provided us with constant directions as well as restaurant ideas. Rooms were also excellent in condition and clean!- Grocery store, drugstore, liquor store, and coffee/book shops, all extremely close for last minute convenience or necessity. Other points:If you're looking for a hotel with other major frills, this might not be the best for you. The lobby is basic and hotel restaurant/bar/cafe was alway empty and quiet. But if you're only there for a short period of time and dont require any special facilities in your hotel, this place is perfect. My recommendation is for the discounted website specials, this hotel has amazing bang for it's buck. If I was going to pay the normal rate at close to 170, I might still choose this hotel, although I'd research around a bit more to see if I could get more for that price. Being as I was looking in the 100 dollars/per range, after all my research and nightmares, this was the best possible outcome I could have hoped for."
15,1456,"Apr 23 2008 	New Years	Stayed at the hotel for new years eve with college friends, and enjoyed the stay but it was nothing special. The price was good because we traveled with a group that got a good rate, and bus transportation from Boston to Montreal included. The hotel is pretty old, slow elevator, basic bath, average rooms. A nice restuarant located in the main lobby which is great because it has a bar with decent priced drinks for a hotel bar. The serivice was good considering the hotel was full of college students there to party for new years eve. almost the entire hotel was full of students who were there to party, so dont go here on new years for a family trip, i would not recommend it. The hotels location is GREAT and is right in the heart of the city and all the best night clubs and bars. As well as very close to all the historical parts of the city of montreal. I have stayed here the past two new years and am planning on going again for NEW YEARS 2009 at the end of this year, and will stay at the lord berri again. and will enjoy my trip there again."
16,1456,"Jan 15 2008 	Decent but way overpriced for what you get.	I have stayed at the Lord Berri twice, and I can honestly say that I have no substantive complaints. The hotel is very basic, safe, relatively clean and quiet.However, for what you get, IMO, the price is a bit steep. You can find small hotels and B and Bs not too far away that are far better value. A couple of years ago, this place was a good deal but for the amount they are charging now, I would take my business elsewhere."
17,1456,"Aug 1 2007 	Lord Berri was a Great Spot!	My friend and I were just at the Lord Berri for a two night stay. It's in a very convenient location (right at the start of the Gay Village, just above ChinaTown, and right next to the Latin Quarter) , and is clean and comfortable. They upgraded us (at no extra charge) to a one-bedroom suite as our requested room type wasn't available upon arrival. It was lovely, with a huge king bed, a sofa bed in the living room, two washrooms, fridge, ironing board/iron. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable (we needed two separate beds so we needed to use the sofa bed) but other than that, it was a perfect spot. The staff was friendly and polite, and with the size of the place (only 10 stories) you don't feel lost in the crowd as you would at a bigger hotel."
18,1456,"Jul 31 2007	Good thing I'm a smoker	Being a smoker, I reserved a Smoking room, but somewhere between me, Travelocity and the Lord Berri, I got a non-Smoking room. Lucky I only had to stay there one night, because the room smelled awful! It smelled like stale sweat only muskier! Next day I was assigned a Smoking room and it had no unpleasant odors at all. In fact I thoroughly enjoyed my remaining four nights in this hotel. Room was comfortable, and quiet even though it was right above a busy street. Staff was pleasant, friendly and very helpful. Had a problem with the tv; they couldn't completely fix the problem but showed me how to manually bypass it to get the tv to work."
19,1456,"May 8 2007 	Great place to stay and a bargin for the location	I have to say that I have stayed at the hotel 3 times now during the montreal jazz festival. The hotel staff were nice and the rooms were very large. The hotel is a bit old, but for the price it was great. In addition everything was very clean and our window had a great view of the city. I will stay at this hotel again this year in July. The other hotels in the area are either not as close or to expensive. In particular during the jazz festival."
20,1456,"Apr 9 2007	Not as bad as other reviews would suggest	We stayed at the hotel while joining some friends who were on a tour from France, so we did not book the hotel ourselves but were part of the tour. When I got the name of the hotel and checked the reviews on Tripadvisor.com, they were so uniformly bad that I almost canceled the trip. All I can is that I'm glad i didn't, as we had a totally different experience. While this is by no means the Ritz , Sheraton, or Hilton, it was perfectly adequate for a night's stay. We came in late independent of our group and the reception was very helpful in finding our reservation and assigned room. The room itself was fine - firm beds and clean, although I would have appreciated an extra blanket - because it was so late I didn't bother calling the desk."
21,1456,"Feb 13 2007 	If I could sue this hotel I would 	I was employed with a group of people in a temp job for a week, and the employer put us up in this hotel. I didn't know much about the hotel, other than it was in a great location downtown, and had a restaurant attached to it. When I walked into the hotel, I felt like I was in some seedy motel that I would see in these old movies. The decor in the lobby appeared to be from a time before I was born. The desk clerk who checked me in, who was actually pretty friendly, indicated that my hotel room was paid for by my employer. She noted that there was 2 of us staying in the room (myself and another employee that I had yet to meet). She indicated that although the room was paid for, I had to leave a credit card or $500 cash to cover incidentals. The other guest would have to do the same when he/she arrived.I was really reluctant to give my credit card info, given that I was in a foreign city staying at some strange motel - who knows what would happen to my personal and credit card info? Seriously - when you walk into this place, you don't get a sense of poshness or security - one doesn't feel safe - very disconcerting actually. But she indicated the nearest bank machine was quite far away. So despite my serious reservations, eventually I gave in, and gave my credit card info, but made it absolutely clear that it was ONLY to be used to cover incidentals and nothing else. I signed the registration form, and off I went to my room.The room was OK. At least the water was hot. Again, the bedcovers and decor was from the 60s or 70s and the carpet looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. The locks on the door looked flimsy - really only a push button lock that can be jiggered with a credit card. I had to put a chair in front of the door. But I've seen worse. Restaurant food just OK - can walk one block east and one block north to the mall, and get early breakfast for a 1/3 of the price though.Check out time - I make sure I get a receipt - showing the room is paid in full, and that I didn't owe anything because no incidentals were charged. I figured, I'm pretty safe.3 months later, I get a massive charge on my credit card for almost $1000. I call the hotel to get an explanation, and they tell me that the clerk who told me that the room was paid for told me the wrong thing, and that they had the right to charge me because they had my credit card &quot;on file&quot;. They also had the right to charge only me, and not the other guest, because the room was under my name, presumably because I checked in first. Because I had signed the &quot;guest registration card&quot; (which didn't even have any credit card info on it), the credit card company refused to reverse the charge.When a hotel takes your credit card, and tells you that they agree to only hold that information for the purposes of paying for incidentals only, and then months later attempts to make some arbitrary charge on it at their own discretion, without any notice to you, knowing that you're not likely going to be there again to fight it, if you even happen to see it on your credit card bill... well, that's pretty SCUMMY. There is nothing that I can do to control what else they do with my credit card or personal information. The lodging themselves were already quite dodgy, and had I known what the lodgings were like, I would have stayed in a hostel instead. But this practice absolutely apalls me. STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!!! For your own sake."
22,1456,"Jan 4 2007 	Well...........................	Well.... I live in montreal and I had to spend one night at this hotel during renovations at my house. First, I want to answer a previous commentary... Even though the bars and others close at 3:00 a.m., it is true that every where else, you can't make noise after 11:00, even if you're at home. It's only a question of respect for other people. There are lots of groups that go there, but also young people studying at the university on the same street, that use this hotel like a residence. Also many people who are waiting for their status concerning immigration. It was not too bad for one night, but I wouldn't have stayed there longer. In our room, we called the reception because we had a question and they answered us awfully, making us feel like .... really disturbing them. The room was really hot even if we were in december ! We even had to use the air-conditioner. It was ok until around 3:00 a.m. This machine started to make an infernal noise and we had to stop it. But the room went hot again immediately, seems like the heating systems was not working well at all. Then at 7:00, the vacuum cleaner began and did not stop for an hour, so we couldn't continue to sleep. Last point but not least... the hotel's restaurant (italian.. Il Cavaliere I think) was horrible, really. It was even really expensive even though it was not good at all."
23,1456,"Jan 2 2007	Never stay there *Please read*	I went to Montreal with a large group of 16 people. We all stayed at the Lord Berri for 3 nights and all had the same horrible experiance. Firstly, they make you feel as if you are there because of punishment rather than pleasure. The first thing you see on your desk is a list of rules and regulations (some of which are absolutely absurd). Along with fines for damages. Some of the rules include: No walking outside your room in your pajamas, no glass allowed, no eating food outside of the room / bar, doors must be closed at all times, and they keep going.Secondly we had a &quot;security&quot; guard tell us that it was a national law in Quebec that quiet hours start at 11. Yes, he was serious. When do they end? Who knows because he wasn't bright enough to divulge that information. Clearly a lie because clubs on the exact same street as the hotel are open until 3 am. But at the Lord Berri that is an offense for which you can get kicked out.Dumb rules yes, but do they actually enforce them? YES. There is a &quot;security&quot; guard on every floor and their sole purpose is to enforce these rules. You will be constantly invaded by one of these guards, and they will not reason with you. 9 times out of time if you try to reason all you will recieve is: &quot;ITS OVER!&quot; and a stern look. One guard actually tackled someone down in the lobby and gave him a fat lip before he profusely apologized.Bathrooms are clean, which is nice. But if you like hot water you'll be out of luck. When showering there is zero hot water and instead it is ice cold. I had to shower out of the sink with cups because the water was THAT cold. It was this cold for all 3 days, not just one.The TVs look like they were made in 1967 but we had an OK picture. One of the rooms in our group though had one that didn't work and the hotel did nothing.There are cleaning services, but if you are caught leaving a &quot;dirty&quot; room and dont pack up all garbage / used towels you are fined an absurd amount. We kept our room clean though.Lastly, here is the most repulsive issue I have ever seen and we could probably sue them over this. Throughout the trip our toilet would not flush. It was fixed though and apparently all was well.One of our friends come home from our New Year's Eve party around 2 am. They realized they left something in the room, and when they walk in our whole room is flooded because the toilet is pumping water into our room at a constant rate. Quickly they shut the toilet off, and remove the furniture from the room. They being attempting get atleast some of the water out.During this process the &quot;security&quot; guard walks up to them and has the nerve to yell at them for having the door open and a chair outside of the room. He did not want to hear what happened, and my friend finally got through the &quot;IT'S OVER&quot; (x's 100000) and once he realized what had happened maybe you'd expect an apology, or someone to help clean up the mess that their faulty toilet caused...nope not at the Lord Berri.They were left alone to handle it, and were told that someone would come in tomorrow. When all of the parties of that room arrived home to a flooded room / damaged personal property because of the water, surely we could stay in another room.We explained what happened at the desk (in a polite manner), and asked if we could stay in a different room for the night. The man at the desk laughed and said sorry that they could not help us, and said that we needed to speak to a manager who wasn't there but would be there in the morning. So 4 people had to sleep in a toilet water infested room, with no explanation at all. So after 3 hours of sleep Will (one of the 4 in our room) wakes up early (8:30 AM) to speak with the manager. They told us again that he was not there. We checked out later that day with no explanation at all. An apology was in order, but nope it never came. Instead we were rushed out with no apology, no refund, and nothing at all. We did get out 20 dollar security deposit back which is a surprise because when the room flooded my friends were told that we'd be paying thousands of dollars worth of damages. We were a room that obeyed every rule, cleaned up after ourselves, and was always polite even after the room flooded. We have the aftermath of the room on video if this seems like too much to be true.DO NOT STAY AT THE LORD BERRI. If it is your only option delay your trip until another hotel is available."

25,1456,"Nov 13 2006 	poor service and promises not met	i wish i read the reviews before booking this.i went to the montreal grandprix race end of august 2006. this was a great loction as it was steps away from the metro underground station what would only take us 10 min to get to the event venue on the island.i booked for a room with 2 double beds, and made the note on the booking.i called hours in advance to confirm my booking and asked to have them read me what was booked. they said 1 double bed. i told them to read my comments. and they said oh sorry, just come and we'll sort it out. i came and was given 1 double bed. i insisted i had already made 2 arrangements while booking and also while calling to confirm but at this point they had nothing available. i dont know why and how they would try and slide this fast one on me.. eventually i was told they OVERBOOKED.. this is not new news to me as far as hotels but im not a fan of it considering i had made arrangements while on the phone while booking and confirming to get something. if i knew they could not or would not be able to keep their end of the agreement then i would not have booked with them. they didnt offer a discount but rather offerered to move me to a double room for my second nite stay and give me 2 vouchers for conennential breakfast their onsite restaurant. i requested to speak to the manager but was told he was out for the week, i contacted them a week a later and they didnt contact me back. perhaps they didnt get my message but either way i was not pleased with the service. im a nice guy and dont give the front desk staff too much of a hard time knowing they're just doing their jobs but i dont apprecite poor service, they just keep saying &quot;what do u want me to do sir, there are no rooms?&quot; on serveral ocassions i said, make me an offer to try and correct this hotels mixup, after having failed me on 3 ocassions to meet my requirements prior to booking.there is only one elevator that goes up, the other tends to be locked for use to access the basement parking, since there is no stair access to the basement.parking is limited indoors to about 15 spots underground, you'll have to park on the parking lot next door which is outdoors and run by another company, where you will have to leave your key with the front desk overnite so they can pack tonnes of cars in their tiny parking lot. give them about 45min headstart prior to leaving so they can move all the cars to get to yours.the tv's in the room were smaller then average. i was in two rooms and they both had a small tv that seemd to be of the older style and about 20inch max. when i was upgraded to the 2 double bed room we also had a small tv, this was a suprize, as i would expcect something average. i wasnt impressed.the location is good as there are restaurants and the metro access is nearby. st. catherines street is along the hotel so u can go for walks and explore the city. i would not and will not go back to this hotel. they failed."
26,1456,"Nov 4 2006 	Looks ok but very bland inside	This hotel charges the amount they do simply because they know they are in a great location of Montreal.You see the east part of downtown montreal (east of the city centre's core) has little competition with large scale hotels.Well, that may wake them up soon with Hilton taking over a property soon and opening up a DOUBLETREE CLUB hotel five minutes from their destination.The hotel is old, needs to be renovated.The rooms are basic, a bed, a small bathroom, a tv with cable but no HBO or extras. Your lucky if you can get 2 beds.I have stayed in their suites as well : Consisting of a room with a pull out sofa and a tiny bathroom (no shower) the king size bed is in a seperate bedroom and has a slightly larger bathroom with a shower. Tv, iron noard, table, and one chair. That's it.... and that's a &quot;suite&quot;My advice, en francais, T'ut Suit :) think twice befire booking there.We also had another issue which shocked us and will keep to ourselves, but let's just say trust is what is keeping us from there ever again."
27,1456,"Oct 3 2006	Awful. Staff should all be fired	Were supposed to stay here 1 night , but we had to find somewhere else to stay. Hotel is in a horrible part of town, bums sleeping in the parking lot. Hotel smelled, staff incredibly rude. I would rather sleep on the corner of St. Catherine's street in a sleeping bag then stay here."
28,1456,"Aug 15 2006 	Great location ok hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights during Gay Pride weekend - the location is perfect for festivals, etc. as there's a large park used for such events just 1/2 block away on Ste. Catherine. For gay visitors, the location is excellent as the gay village is just a few short blocks further down Ste. Catherine. Needless to say, this weekend the hotel was just crawling with sisters!There are very few big hotels in this area, which is a shame - St. Denis is a block away, with its 3-4 blocks of small restaurants and cafes piled on top of each other; a Metro stop is just a couple of blocks away; you can walk anywhere downtown easily from here.The rest is all very 2-star: the rooms are dull but serviceable, and even though we asked for a quiet non-smoking room, it reeked of years of stale smoke and the double windows couldn't block out the street noise (Berri is a busy street, except during festival weekends when it's closed to traffic). Luckily the A/C was working great, as it was very hot and humid. There's a convenient internet kiosk ($1 for 15mins) in the lobby which worked well.Parking was sold out when we arrived, so we parked in a large private outdoor lot right next door ($15/day); the next morning we got an indoor spot (again $15/day, but tiny - only 16 spaces)."
29,1456,"Jan 1 2006	New Years Eve Rocked	I spent New Years Eve in Montreal with 12 of my buddies. We stayed at the Lord Berri and it was great. The location was great, the staff was awesome and the rooms were clean and larger than we expected. I thank the staff at the Lord Berri for accommodating us, we would stay there again next year. Happy New Year 2006!!!!!!"
30,1456,"Aug 19 2005	Berri Good Deal For A Short Trip	I stayed at the Lord Berri on a trip from my camp. I do not know how much money was spent per room, but it must have been a very low amount...LOBBY: The lobby of the hotel is very nice for lounging. There is a computer in the corner where you can get 15 minutes of internet access for $1CA, a very good deal compared to what I've seen in most hotels.ROOMS: The rooms were very large and the Air Conditioners were very responsive. You could set your temperature to anything and the air conditioner would work instantly. The TV got some good channels, mostly in french, which was not good for the all-english speaking camp tourgroup. It was interesting however to watch American shows with the French dubbed. You could imagine what they were saying, which was fun. Fridge/Freezer in each room was a nice touch, and unexpected to us.BATHROOM: Nice amenity kit for a budget hotel, including sewing kit, and Pantene Pro-V shampoos, one of the nicest I've seen in any hotel I've stayed at. The showers had good pressure and temperature, however there was a plastic wall that cut into the shower that I did not think was necessary. This was not providing the maximum showering space, which I did not like.BEDS: Very comfortable. I had a very nice sleep in the bed for the two nights I stayed there.DOWNSIDE...only one telephone, located no where near bed, making wake up calls a hassle to answer.LOCATION: A good location to all of the activities we were doing. Parking is adjacent to the hotel which provided a conveinent spot for the cars. Within walking distance from Old Montreal, which is a place to definitely check out. OVERALL: I only saw people in groups at the hotel, and I think the hotel does a good job at catering to groups. If you do not like a lot of children around the floors, Hotel Lord Berri is DEFINITELY the wrong hotel. If you don't mind children, and not having a pool or fitness center, Hotel Lord Berri is a great hotel."
