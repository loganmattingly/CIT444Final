31,1456,Jul 5 2005	Great hotel great price!	Stayed in Montreal for 3 days. I was VERY impressed with this hotel. Clean and location was perfect. I would stay here again without hesitation!
32,1456,"May 24 2005	Rip off	I should have listened to the above reviews saying not to stay here. The staff is indeed very rude and does not care at all if you are not happy. Every time we called the front desk to ask for directions or help on where to go for food or entertainment, they didn't have a clue about anything and was like pulling teeth to get them to help. When we asked if they had a vending machine the guy at the front desk told us that no they don't have one and what do we expect for a 3 star hotel! That's actually what he said! We witnessed the girl at the front desk tell someone that there is a $50.00 fee if you check out late and she actually hung up on the person she was telling this to. So if you stay there don't check out late! Also, we arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. Check in time is 3:00. Our room was not ready yet and we were told it would be another 30 minutes! Room should have been ready at 3:00!! The room itself was OK, A bit outdated. Not the nicest, and definitely NOT worth the $149.00 we were quoted on the phone when we called. We ended up with a last minute deal for $93.00 but I'd say this room was worth maybe $79.00. The girl at the desk told us we had an adjoining room and we ended up with two rooms down completely different hallways. When we asked about this she told us that she didn't know what adjoining meant. We had a couple of problems with maids telling us they had written down on their sheet that we were checking out that day when we weren't so we had to go clear that up with the front desk. And they never did bother to come and give us clean towels or make our beds on our second day. We had to find a maid in the hallway and ask her to come and do that at 5:00 in the evening. The day we arrived our bath tub had hairs all over it. So they clearly don't clean that in between customers. And the &quot;indoor&quot; parking has about 10 spots (for $16.00 a day). Good luck getting in and out of that parking garage. We were charged $1.15 for each LOCAL call we made. Usually that is free. We had two rooms and the phone in the other room wasn't working properly. On a positive note, the guy who ran the bar in the restaurant was friendly and far more helpful with directions than the front desk and the young guy who worked in the smoke shop was friendly also and helped us with directions. They should be at the front desk."
33,1456,Apr 10 2005 	Excellent	I stayed for a night at this hotel and since I came late I requested an extension of the time of the checkout and my request was very nicely accepted. My room was very clean and the staff were very professional and very nice even guiding me through maps over the major outlets in the city and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is in a business trip in downtown or for leisure.
34,1456,"Mar 11 2005	Obviously they do not care about their customers	We booked 2 nights in Montreal at the Hotel Lord Berri about a month in advance of our trip. We booked through hotels and on the web site concerning the Hotel Lord Berri it stated &quot;indoor parking (free)&quot;. Well when we got there, the desk clerk told us there was no indoor parking and we had to park outside and pay $13 a day. Upon leaving the hotel we discovered there was indoor parking and asked to speak to the manager about it, since our two night stay turned into a three night stay due to damage while we were parked in the parking lot outside. He was not in and two desk clerks were very helpful with our concerns and issues. However, the first employee we talked to was beyond the point rude. She was not helpful at all and infact insulted us instead. We were told the manager would call us in a day and discuss our concerns with the parking and his employees. He did not call and when we finally called in a couple days later, while we were still on vacation, he made it clear he purposely did not call us and would not help us. After a long chat he said he would call us back in a week after talking to his employees. Well he didn't and when we did again he began yelling and simply hung up on us. The hotel obviously is not concerned with the satisfaction of their customers and I would never reconmmend that hotel to even my worst enemy."
35,1456,Oct 29 2004	Good hotel great location	The hotel was clean. Staff friendly. Restaurant served a good breakfast. One block from Berri subway station. 2 blocks from Quarter Latin. Quiet area. I couldn't ask for a better hotel for $80.00/night. My friends and I are going back next year and we will again stay here.
36,1456,Sep 24 2004	A Comfortable Place to Stay	A decent place to stay for a weekend getaway. Facility is clean and close enough to St. Catherine's Street. The rooms are comfortable. The price is fair. I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and I am actually booking another trip to Montreal next month and this is where I plan on staying.
37,1456,"Oct 3 2002	Rip off	For the price $120 a night its complete rip off. Its is not 3 star hotel AT ALL. I booked 3 weeks in advance asking for non-smoking and guess what...got smoking room. Its an old hotel therefore the floors are smelly. Rooms have tiny windows looking across the other hotel. At the front desk young guys are on minimum wages so dont expect any professionalism. I asked for iron in the morning, wow! they did not know it was broken, it was 100 year old iron. The people in the hotel are all groups. This hotel sells rooms at discounted prices for probably $30 to a groups so buses all over. If you don't want to spoil you trip in Montreal, don't stay there. We only could stay one night and moved out to Fabourge hotel closer to downtown. Its a 2 star but what a difference!!!! for SAME PRICE!!! New hotel, just a year build. Breakfast included, valet parking, professional staff, beautifull!!! Recommended very much."
38,1456,"Apr 1 2002	Good and resonable place to stay.	Lord Berri, is always really reasonable and good accommodations. I have been to the more expensive hotels in Montreal and I found that my experience at Lord Berri has been the best."

1,1458,"Nov 5 2009 	..perfect location	just in the heart of downtown, this small hotel is an excllent option if you don't want to spend much but still want to stay in a convenient location in downtown..the staff were friendly...an old house turned into a hotel...rooms are of good size..didn't like the breakfast service (included with room) though..my overall experience is very pleasent and would like to go back and stay in the same hotel!!"
2,1458,"Jul 10 2009 	Good and clean but felt squeezed in.	We went to this hotel because it was recommended by Fodors. The location is great. The place offers paid parking if you reserve it in advance. The breakfast in the morning is sufficient to fuel you in the morning. The staff is very friendly - if you are arriving early or departing later, they can store your luggage before you check in/ after you check out. Check out the stairs near the reception, looks like a mirror!However, the room was extremely small. We had shower cubicle and a sink inside the room and the toilet outside (the manager did tell us this when making the reservation). Our blanket had tiny holes in it. Also, no elevators here - you will have to carry your luggage to your room - so travel light! For what you get, the room felt pricey for $100 + taxes (which is quite high in Montreal)."
3,1458,"Oct 24 2007 	Fantastic location charming hotel	After reviewing the web site of this hotel, I was already charmed. Service on arrival was very courteous and helpful in planning our stay in Montreal. The room was large, very clean, comfortable and very quiet. We had a very pleasant trip in Montreal largely due to the recommandations of the manager (Lucie) and to the easy access of most point of interest in Montreal, including the old city and underground shopping area.I highly recommand this hotel for its charming victorian style, a good price and an excellent service."
4,1458,"Jun 7 2007	Try to Avoid If You Can	The hotel is in a great location to be downtown and close to the Metro. The standard room is VERY small and needs some work. The rugs are old and stained and the room also smelled like urine. You must beware that even though the hotel site states they have wireless internet, what we didnt know until we got here is that its extra money to get a username and password to access their server. Luckily we are only here one night because we can barely open our suitcases and you definetely cant walk around the bed with them open."
5,1458,"Jan 21 2006	Charm and location	We picked this location for our stay in Montreal because of its downtown location and novelty of staying in a small inn off the beaten path. We weren't disappointed. The staff was helpful and accomodating throughout our stay. Our flight arrived in Montreal at around 1am and after checking with the management in advance we were able to check in at this late hour. Even though the staffer &quot;on duty&quot; that night had to get out of bed to check us in, we still felt welcomed.Our room was on the top floor and had a private bathroom. The room was clean, well-maintained and more spacious than I expected. No, it's not as big as a room at the Hilton or Sheraton would be, but we didn't feel cramped. The complimentary breakfast was definitely not the highlight of our stay. There were a few choices of dry breads and muffins, as well as coffee, tea, juice and milk. The breakfast room felt like we were eating in a staff lunch room. This was a charming hotel for our stay in Montreal. It's definitely a different experience than staying at one of the large chain hotels, but I truly enjoyed it. As already mentioned, the hotel has a great location - just off the McGill Campus, right downtown, a block from a Metro station. I would have a hard time visiting Montreal and NOT staying at the Manoir Ambrose....I'm very pleased."
6,1458,"Aug 1 2005	Very comfortable at Manoir Ambrose	Our stay at Manoir Ambrose was very comfortable and quiet. Although the weather was very warm outside, the AC and the portable fan kept us very comfortable. The room was clean and roomy enough. Definitely above average for the price paid. The manager and evening staff were very pleasant to deal with."
7,1458,"Dec 16 2004	Glad I cancelled my reservation there!!	I am glad I cancelled my reservation at the Manoir Ambrose Inn! I am a diabetic,and due to worsening diabetic-related health issues,I was under medical advice to cancel my entire Montreal trip this week. I regret only cancelling the trip. I have stayed in Holiday Inn,:Midtown,Sheraton Midtown, also Hotel de la Montagne. All of these hotels,esp Hotel de la Montagne,and the Sheraton,are far better than the Monoir Ambrose Inn. After I sent an e-mail letter 48 hours to the Innkeeper,advising them of my reasons for cancelling,I received a rather uncivil and rude and nasty reply. They wanted to charge me for the room. Based upon the comments here,this Inn is no bargain. In the words of the Film Industry (which I work for) the Manoir Ambrose Inn is a &quot;Stiff&quot;!! In future,the Manoir Ambrose Inn will not receive any business from me. I DO NOT recommend this Inn AT ALL. There are better Inns in Ottawa,London,Kingston."
8,1458,"Nov 2 2004	our favorite	having tried several places in montreal i will always return to manoir ambrose it's location, price and decor are unparalleled. never dissastisfied."
9,1458,"Sep 28 2004	Ambiance and Value	I was utterly impressed with my stay at the Ambrose Manoir this weekend in Montreal.The price was 112(CAD) after all taxes (2 people). I was a little concerned because of the way they told me my suite was in the basement and the bathroom was seperate (private w/key- but outside the room). However, when I got their I thought that it was awesome - it was like a cozy basement apartment. The room looked just as good as any hotel room and the bathroom was really clean an original. The location is also perfect. Right near St. Catherines and about a ten minute walk to the train station. As well, the outside of the building had this awesome vintage old Montreal feel to it.I was completely satisfied."
10,1458,"Apr 27 2004	Good Location	The Manoir Ambrose is reasonably priced, quiet and in a convenient location, near the McGill campus and the nightlife on Rue Crescent. Our room was small but decently furnished, though the water pressure on the third floor made the tiny shower a bit trying. Also, the climb up the narrow, steep stairs might be difficult for some folks.Nobody should expect first-class amenities in a small hotel at that price, but one might hope for a little more charm. The staff was inattentive and rather cold and the continental breakfast was paltry and bland.Overall, it's not a bad deal if the location suits you. Otherwise, you can probably do better elsewhere."
11,1458,"Nov 17 2003	None of the complaints as above.	The Ambrose was recommended in Frommer's Budget Traveler magazine and lived up to the review...it was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was good. What more do you want for $65 (US) a night. We encountered none of the problems that others dealt with...fortunately, I guess!"
12,1458,"Feb 19 2003	Worst hotel ever!	This was absolutely the worst hotel experience I have ever had. When a friend of ours tried to call our room, the concierge would not transfer her call, and proceeded to call our room to tell us (angrily) that we had woken her up. In addition, she actually came to our room, said that we were told that we could not have a phone call after 10:30pm (which we were never told), and insulted us, saying we &quot;needed to learn how to hear&quot;. Because of her rudeness, we left the hotel in the morning and stayed somewhere else the following night. She even had the audacity to make us pay for 2 nights... we were just glad to get out of there! I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone!!"
13,1458,"Nov 16 2002	Value and location	The Manoir Ambrose is in a very good location, close to stores and the subway. It's in a quiet area and for the price, we found it to be very good. Any other place in this area would cost double. If you have unlimited expenses, sure, pay for a 5 star hotel, but for travellers on a budget, this place is fine."
14,1458,"Jul 22 2002	you get what you pay for......	...well, the Ambrose is not the Ritz, but it is located only a block or so away. The location is great and so is the price. No, you are not going to feel pampered here, but with the money you save you can get out and enjoy the city. If you are looking to save some cash this is a comfortable place to crash. The basement rooms are a bit dank, but a great way to beat the heat in the summer. If you have a room on a higher floor, make sure it has AC."
15,1458,"May 15 2002	Manoir Ambrose better look elsewhere	While the location near McGill is nice, as well as the exterior, the hotel is the pits! Our matress was lumpy and stained beyone belief. The rug was also stained. Breakfast had a new twist: you are advised to wash your own dishes. While I wouldnt mind this in a dorm or even a B&amp;B, in a so-called hotel its a joke.When we decided to leave asap the next morning to find other accomodations, the manager wanted to charge us for another night! An outrage.You can do much better for less in Montreal by staying in a B&amp;B, of which there are tons. &quot;Pierre and Dominique&quot; is a nice one in a great area.NOT recommended!"

18,1458,Aug 16 2007	Dception
1,1463,"Nov 3 2009 	Trendy nice hotel in great area of Montreal	This hotel was trendy but had very good service. The rooms were nice, very confortable beds and bathrooms. Within walking distance to restaurants and bars. The hotel restaurant was very good."
2,1463,"Oct 11 2009 	Pretentious	The hotel room has very modern furnishings that it is bordering on being uncomfortable. The lighting in the room is insufficient unless you prefer your rooms to be in the barely-lit category. There is one &quot;desk chair&quot; that is as comfortable as a molded plastic chair and the &quot;comfy chair&quot; doesn't have much padding on it either. We had coffee on the 2 days that we were there and they replenished the coffee without replenishing the sugar. I don't know if it was missed but since the containers were side by side you would think that they would replenish that when they did the coffee. Thank goodness I take my coffee black because they don't provide creamer either. The hotel is bordered on one side by a street that is inhabited by drunks and substance abusers. Be careful when walking on Rue St-Laurent because people will accost you for change and there are men who urinate on the sides of the buildings so be careful of those wet puddles, they might not be water. I will recommend this hotel only if you like rooms that have gray concrete ceilings, dark brown furniture, dark blue walls, dark gray carpet, brown window shades and low lighting. I'm glad the bedding was white or I would have never found the bed."
3,1463,"Oct 10 2009 	Top-Notch Service	What stands out most about the Opus is the professional and courteous service--from the doormen to the cleaning staff, to the front desk. The room was cleaned twice daily, and the front desk personnel made dinner reservations and handled taxi cabs. The rooms were certainly nice, but not exceptional. The adjoining bar was convenient and classy."
4,1463,"Oct 6 2009 	Chic Hot Spot with exceptional service at a down to earth price	Perfect location withing walking distance of Saint Catherine for shopping, Notre Dame for Old Montreal, Cresent for Dining, Saint Laurent for night life, This hotel Has it all! Great restaraunt, club inside, and service to boot. Everyone was friendly and cutious. It wa also a Aniversary for my wife and I and the upon entering our room, the turn down service had left a bottle of Champaign. We Will be staying there again!"
5,1463,"Oct 4 2009 	think twice!	I have never written a negative review for a hotel, this is my first. Hotel room is too dark, I guess they were trying to go with their modern style of decor. Although I like how the bathroom is set up, however it doesnt have enough space/hooks/bars to hang or put your things on, again this could be due to their decor style. After a long day of travel or sightseeing, you want to be in a room that is comfortable and cozy. Opus Montreal is not.Also, location is not recommended if you are just a tourist.One good point: free wifi access at the lobby"
6,1463,Sep 30 2009 	Amazing service stylish cool chic comfortable friendly great location	My stay at the Opus was fantastic. I had high expectations for service style and comfort and I am happy to say that all expectations were surpassed. The location is in walking distance of all that is a must see in Montreal. You don't have to walk to far though for an amazing dining out experience as the hotels restaurant and cocktail lounge &quot;KOKO'S&quot; offers an exciting culinary experience and serves up some real tasty and unique beverages. Certainly the place to see and be seen..very cool!
7,1463,"Sep 27 2009 	Comfortable beds - too bad I couldn't sleep	I wish I had read some of these reviews before deciding to stay at the Opus Hotel in Montreal. The hotel itself was very nice, comfortable, and the valet staff was great. However, the nightclub kept us awake until 3am with the thumping, and the front desk gave me directions that had me driving down a one way street the wrong way. Needless to say, I would NEVER stay at this hotel again, which is too bad because it has such great potential."
8,1463,"Sep 26 2009 	Good hotel if you don't intend on sleeping	Trendy spot has great beds and good service. Unfortunately it also doubles as a nightclub which blared music right below our room from midnight until 3am, two nights in a row. Two other guests we talked to complained of the same thing. The management at this hotel need to decide if they want to be a nightclub or a hotel."
9,1463,"Sep 23 2009 	The valet damaged the transmission in my car.	Nothing too remarkable about the hotel itself. It's on St-Laurent so if that's near where you plan to go out the location is nice. Room rates are far above average for Montreal so it is no bargain, especially if you consider the hidden risks. On check-in they gave me the wrong type of room. The front desk fixed the problem by bringing up keys to the correct type of room but mumbled something about it somehow being my fault. I don't understand the purpose of their comment. What difference does it make? It was no problem at all until they made a fuss.Room was fine but construction noise started early in the morning (08:30) in the courtyard. After checking out the valet brought my car around and we drove off. I realized pretty quickly that the valet had done serious damage to my transmission. I had no reverse gear. This was a problem that could have been easily solved if the hotel covered the modest cost of the repair but instead they quite obviously (and quite embarrassingly! Poor front line staff!) avoided my calls for 2 weeks until I gave up. I guess they must be running out of money."
10,1463,Sep 19 2009 	2nd visit and Opus does it again! Amazing!	We just had to return to this hotel during our recent tour on the East side of N. America. Everything is well thought out. It's a great place for young and &quot;in&quot; travelers or anyone that appreciates a contemporary hotel.Great restaurant called Koko with beautiful decor. Great staff all well dressed and groomed.Top 3 most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!Just keep in mind that this is a place that is known for it's nightlife... there will be noise. Embrace it!!!
11,1463,Sep 18 2009 	Excellent service and experience!	We had such a positive experience with all the staff at the Opus. We were a comedy of errors as we had messed up our reservation on line and then our car broke down. Every one was extremely helpful as we were &quot;Chaos&quot;. We loved the Koko's restaurant on Saturday night - incredible food and attention to detail. My husband and I brought our bikes and loved all the extensive bike routes through the city. Coming from a different time zone - we were able to sleep in and not hear any noise from other rooms or in the halls.The bed is comfortable and the room is stylish and functional - very European. The area hosts excellent restaurants -all in walking distance. We totally enjoyed it.
12,1463,"Aug 31 2009 	Passe chic average value and at boundary of stylish neighbourhood	An average chic hotel, designed by the same mindless people as those who built similar style hotels in Taipei, Paris, Hong Kong, Bangkok, etc. Lack of lighting, dark walls and floors, noisy ventilation, leaking glass shower stalls, funky accessories from Pier 1... except this one is very spacious and bright."
13,1463,"Aug 17 2009 	Great Spot But With Some Notes	Just returned from a weekend stay at the Opus Montreal and overall it was a very good experience. It is a boutique style hotel and is very hip and can be loud but if you go expecting that than you will be happy with the stay. The place is very well situated in a great area for shops and food (go up St. Laurent to find all kinds of great spots).The only issue I have is that compared to the Vancouver Opus, I found Montreal to be less accomodating. In Van, the staff went out of their way to serve our every need and it seemed that &quot;no&quot; was not in their vocabulary. In Montreal I found the staff were not at all like that. Early check in...no. Late check out....no....In Vancouver I asked in the lounge/lobby if there was a place where I could get coffee and tea and I was told to sit down and they would bring it. In Montreal, a waive toward the corner 'theres a coffee machine over there'Just the subtle differences in the quality of service but regardless, Opus Montreal was still a great place to stay."
14,1463,"Aug 10 2009 	Vapid like Paris Hilton (not the hotel - the personality)	If Style is important to you and substance is not - than this is your hotel. We stayed at this hotel during the Montreal Jazz Festival. The location is great - and the hotel looks great. What is missing is the ability to sleep. There is a THUMPING NIGHT CLUB right below you. We asked for a room far enough away so that we would not hear the club - they put us on the 4th floor. It did not work. The ear plugs they provide do not help - the bed, floor and room vibrate. People were talking loudly from 3-5am - and even were screaming at some points during the night. I told the front desk in the morning that it was one of the worst nights sleep that I ever had - and the response was (oh Yeah the night club is pretty loud on weekends)... not even a &quot;we are sorry&quot;. I said that I was going to write a scathing review on TripAdvisor and other webpages - and I just got awful stares - with no words at all. What a disappointment and complete waste of money. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!"
15,1463,"Aug 10 2009 	Awsome hotel.	I travel to montreal about once a mth for the last 20 years, staying in hotels for the last 8. I would have to say of all the hotels in the city I have stayed at, the OPUS ranks up there. The valets were EXCELLENT, the atmosphere was trendy, and the front desk very helpful. Located in the heart of St Laurent St, the was a quick walk and ride to many places. The room rates were respectable, and to top it off, when you turn on the TV it has your name on the screen! Rooms were clean, quite and very nice, whom ever said there was a noise issue, or room service was always knocking when you didnt ask them were wrong, I had my DO NOT DISTURB sign, and wasnt disturbed till about 3pm, and i politly asked front desk that i am out of the room, may i get service,and boom by 4pm when i was back, room was clean, and they even found my partners earings from the night before. HIGHLY recomend this hotel, small, trendy, good looking patrons, and being 28, just the right atmosphere for me!"
16,1463,"Aug 9 2009 	Wouldn't stay anywhere else!	Great staff, ideal location, and perfect vibe. Having lived in Montreal, it is amazing to stay in a hotel, be able to walk out the front door and be minutes (walk, metro or taxi) from &quot;all that's happening&quot; in the city. The staff recommended great places, Koko was a blast and the rooms (we stayed twice..) were very comfortable, one with a courtyard view, the other with a stunning city view.Special requests (more ice, glasses, towels, re-booting the TV/internet which I broke, extra umbrella and a hotel car ride to the train station, etc) were accomodated exceedingly well. Even the fitness room was a pleasant surprise (we typically find hotel gyms useless - this one worked for us)We'll be back - and would not stay elsewhere in Montreal!"
17,1463,"Aug 4 2009	Great place to stay at.	The room was beautiful, hotel was very cozy and comfortable and the service was excellent."
18,1463,"Jul 29 2009 	Opus hits it right on all your business and leisure needs	I have stayed at Opus several times for both business and pleasure. From the moment you drive up to the door, you can tell that this is a first class establishment.From the valet to the front desk, you get the feeling right away that the staff has had a higher level of training that most.The rooms are sophisticated with a modern feel without going overboard.Koko Restaurant is amazing. the food is exquisite and portions are generous. I highly recommend staying around until the party gets started usually around 11:00 ish. The place turns in to a club / lounge with Montreal's best looking people. And the terrace has to be Montreal's best. If you know anything about Montreal, you know that Montrealers live for terraces.I recommend Opus without hesitation."
19,1463,"Jul 28 2009 	Opus is my favorite hotel in Montreal.	The Opus Hotel is the perfect place to say if you are traveling to Montreal. It has wonderful rooms, a great restaurant, friendly staff and is very lively for those of you who are looking for something to do after dinner. Not to mention it's great location in relation to all of the best shops, restaurants and culture in the city."
20,1463,"Jul 24 2009 	Great service and location!	Pros:We stayed for an entire week in July in a Privilege King room. From reading other reviews, we requested a room on the 5th floor and had absolutely NO problem with noise/vibrations from the bar.The service for our room was great. Our bed was made daily, the radio was turned on to a classical station to welcome us whenever we arrived at night, all bathroom products were promptly replaced even before they were half-done and the &quot;refill boy&quot; came by a number of times to ask if our coffee machine needed refills. Even if we left with the Do Not Disturb sign on, the cleaning lady always made sure to ask us if we needed extra towels, etc. when we ran into her. The front desk was also very helpful, and it seemed that there was always someone opening the front door regardless of the time of night (or morning) we came in.By far the greatest PRO would be the great location: On St. Laurent with the trendiest restaurants and boutiques; a walk away from St. Catherine and Crescent Street for shopping and more restaurants; a metro station a couple of blocks down. Overall, everything I wanted to see/do was close to Opus and we rarely took a taxi or public transportation.Cons: The only complaint I have about the room was that it was TOO DARK during the night, with no ceiling lights since their ceilings are made of concrete. Even with two lamps, two bedside table lamps, and a mirror light on, the room was very dark, making it hard to get ready, put on makeup, etc. In retrospect, I am almost certain if I asked for another tall lamp they would have provided it.Also, don't order the breakfast from the hotel. It is extremely overpriced! A simple breakfast with juice will cost one person $22. However, if you walk north of Sherbrooke on St. Laurent you will find a restaurant called Cafeteria that will serve more than what Opus offers for less than $9. To me, Koko was also overpriced; you are paying for the ambience and not the amount of food on your plate. The service was not exceptional here either; expo brought out our food assuming our appetizer plates had been cleared (since they sat empty for 20 minutes) and we also waited a long time for our refills. Go there for drinks - not for dinner.Despite these cons, I would 100% stay at Opus again. The service was exceptional and the location was great! If you are interested in coming when the Jazz Festival or Just for Laughs is on , this is a prime location."
21,1463,"Jul 23 2009 	SPECTACULAR - EXCITING - ROMANTIC - COZY - AMAZING!!!	As guests at the OPUS HOTEL MONTREAL in May 2009, for a very special occasion, we both felt very welcome and given all the attention a King &amp; Queen expect plus more. We felt totally relaxed and comfortable. We want to thank both management and staff for a wonderful and memorable stay.Until our next visitDoreen &amp; Louis Schlomowitz"
22,1463,Jul 12 2009 	Awesome summer getaway	This hotel is conveniently located off St Laurent Blvd which is packed with Montreal's top restaurants &amp; nightclubs. We literally walked out the door and into the heart of the action. It would highly recommend the Opus Hotel in Montreal!
23,1463,"Jul 6 2009 	For inexperienced wealthy travelers only - others go elsewhere	1- Strict check-in timing 3:00 pm and not a minute earlier - nowhere to freshen up meanwhile; staff was not accomodating at all, especially with our 3 year-old. 2- Our main suitcase was missing from the luggage brought to our room - had to convince them we were missing a suitcase and then wait for them to find it 3- staff instructed to knock insistently on suite door even if &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign is hanging on door knob, in order to check the mini-bar.... employee was litterally banging on the door until we opened it and was not about to apologize! 4- breakfast at Holiday Inn is better than what Opus served, even the bagels were old! 5- $30CDN/per day for valet parking is more than any other Montreal hotel. 6- weekend bar/lounge music made hallway frames shake - room was quiet though 7- cleaning was average, although we had asked for new towels, our old ones were put back on the rack and the staff did not provide coffee after the first day. We have traveled extensively throughout the world with and without children and this hotel is among the worst &quot;luxury&quot; hotels we have ever stayed at. Needless to say, Montreal has a lot more and better luxury hotels and we will be more than happy to explore them next time. We go there twice a year at least and will not soon forget this $400CDN+/night nightmare!"
24,1463,"Jul 5 2009 	What a great experience	The Opus Montreal was truly a refreshing change from the large hotel chains I stay at for business. From the time the cab drops one odf, the experience begins- One enters this inviting interesting lobby, one is greeted with a welcoming smile at receptions. the room are faulous and have a modern yet relaxing feels about them.Suko is a very social bar. Dinner at KOKO is a must-fabulous food and fabulous decor-WOWif you are in a quandry as to where to go for dinner just ask Patrick-his recommendations were all great-Thanks!All in all a fantastic experienceWE WILL BE BACK"
25,1463,"Jun 8 2009 	All show--don't go	Like many other reviewers, we too were kept awake until the wee hours by an entirely unacceptable level of noise. Functions until 3am, then people talking loudly in the halls until 5--beyond the pale. We got the &quot;Oh, didn't they tell you&quot; runaround when we talked to the front desk the first morning after, and got parking and room service comped, but that hardly makes up for the one, primary, non-negotiable service a hotel must provide: a good night's sleep!Service was so-so outside of that. Room service was unimpressive. The price for room was fair; other prices less so.Overall, had the impression of what a hotel run by Apple computer (or Steve Jobs) would be like: pretty to look at, entirely (and overly) trendy, but short on delivery.If you must go, be SURE you are not on the side of the hotel facing the bar/function courtyard."
26,1463,"May 27 2009 	48 hours without any sleep!	Every room on our side of the hotel was over their night club, which had events both Saturday and Sunday night that lasted until after 3 a.m. in the morning. The ear plugs next to the bed did nothing to help with the fact that the room was vibrating. It was truly horrendous. The hotel itself is very nice, but for the price I'd expect to be able to get some sleep. Never again."
27,1463,"May 7 2009 	perfect location from all the attractions.	We recently had a guys weekend in Montreal and stayed at the Opus hotel. This was a perfect locale / setting for the weekend. The hotel itself is located at sherbrooke and stlaurent, which are the two prime streets in montreal, intersecting - Within a short walk in any direction is incredible nightlife, restaurants and shopping. The hotel has a sleek, chic boutique feel with very friendly, non-pretentious staff. The rooms are very tastefully decorated. On the main floor with special access for guests is Koko restaurant which turns into a very happening nightspot post dinner. I travel frequently within the US and Canada and it definitely is one of the better hotels i have stayed in (south beach chill feel with a subtle new york coolness to it)."
28,1463,"May 6 2009 	Designer ear plugs at the bedside a real tipoff!	We appreciated the perfect location, impeccable room design, and lush lobby of Opus Montreal, but the box of designer ear plugs at our bedside was a real tipoff! We heard every conversation in the rooms on either side of us, every door slamming in the halls, every elevator ding, and every piece of luggage being rolled down the hallways. It was just unacceptable for a hotel that is so first-rate in other ways. Just appreciate the art direction of the lobby, the outside deck, and the restaurant, but don't stay here."
29,1463,"Apr 28 2009 	Stylish comfortable hotel.	Very comfortable room, lots of desk space, nice bathroom arrangement. Noise wasn't an issue, but likely because we were there on a Sunday night. The restaurant/bar is certainly set up for loud, swank nights. Restaurant for dinner was very good, the quality lived up to the price. Continental breakfast buffet was not bad. All staff were helpful and pleasant.WiFi in lobby was iffy; didn't purchase WiFi in room. Hotel is right across from Just for Laughs venue."
30,1463,"Apr 20 2009 	Noise Level is Unacceptable: Higher End Hotel with Low End experience	I too made the mistake of not checking this site before booking the hotel. To be sure, the public areas are very nice and we found the staff courteous and helpful. The restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent. But the noise from the bar was awful. We were placed in the room right over the bar. The furniture rumbled, the lights shook and the decibel level was so loud, the ear plugs were useless. (Honestly, ear plugs....at a high end hotel?) The staff are well aware of the problem but we were not advised before we booked the room. I complained and asked to be moved. We were told that the hotel was full and this was not possible. The supervisor offered a 50 percent discount for the room. I declined saying that 50 a percent discount for half a night's sleep was unacceptable. We received a full refund. To my mind, the compensation we received was a bare minimum. A hotel that is unable to guarantee conditions that support sleep, shouldn't be in business as a hotel."
31,1463,"Mar 2 2009 	Wonderful Weekend Stay!	The Hotel Opus is a true gem! I rank it as one of the top hotels that I've ever visited. The staff and their level of service were remarkable, making the stay even more enjoyable. Koko, the restaurant at the hotel, is a must when you visit - the food there was delicious! I will definitel stay at Opus again."
32,1463,"Dec 30 2008 	What a great Choice!!!!	From the moment we got there we LOVED it!Katherine was very helpful with the reservation (including dinner reservations at Koko), Ralph the bellboy and valet guy was just great.... We didn't want to leave....Rooms are amazing, Koko was delicious and trendy.This is the RIGHT WAY to experience Montreal!We will be back for sure!"
33,1463,"Dec 30 2008 	High style mediocre service	The Opus had loads of style and a great location. The bed was comfortable and the shower was absolutely lovely with plenty of hot water.On the downside, the service was sub-par. The doorman was rarely at the door, our room wasn't made up at four o'clock in the afternoon and the bar wasn't open on Sunday afternoon when we went down for a pre-dinner cocktail.A word of warning for light sleepers, the hotel bar is quite loud at times. On Saturday night, we could hear the music from the bar in our third floor room. Although there were earplugs in the bathroom (someone must know of the issue!), you might want to request a room far away from the bar if this might keep you awake!"
34,1463,"Oct 27 2008 	Opus Montreal was great	This hotel felt very trendy/funky without being pretentious. The rooms were really big, and the beds were so comfortable, it was hard to get up in the morning. The turn down service left green tea chocolates...pretty cool.Definitely felt like you were part of the action; the restaurant downstairs always seemed to be busy, and became a late-night hot spot for locals."
35,1463,"Oct 27 2008 	Loved Everything	I stayed at Opus for one nite in September and was impressed from the moment I pulled up to the curb. The Valet took my baggage and keys right away and led me into the reception area to check in. They were incredibly professional and very welcoming to the hotel. Once I got to my room - I actually had to snap a couple of pictures to send to my wife right away as I wished that she could have joined me on the trip. It was amazing!!! Then I proceeded down to Koko for drinks and dinner later that afternoon and was even more impressed by the surrounding, great service and amazing food and cocktails.All in all - I would say that staying at this hotel is a must if you are going to Montreal on business or pleasure - I cant wait for my next trip to be scheduled.Thank you to everyone at Opus!!"
36,1463,"Oct 18 2008 	Pretty on the outside....	Very pretty to look at, I actually really loved the decor. Pinks and blacks. When I arrived well after check in almost 5pm my room wasn't ready. Front desk informed me the shower in my room was being repaired and it would be ready shortly. I was in fabulous mood and decided to wander around the neighbourhood. Upon returning front desk apologized. After checking in and setting up my laptop I noticed my internet was not complimentary as was promised by the entertainment sales manager. I called the front desk and they took care of the problem promptly. A few minutes later there was a knock at door. I was expecting an apology favour (considering what a high profile boutique hotel the opus is) only to have my door opened by two engineers apologizing as they didn't know the room was occupied. Then a few minutes later a woman from housekeeping opens my door (no knock what so ever) sees me and without an apology or any explanation shuts the door. How unorganized was this place! It blew my mind. Aren't we in the year 2008? I thought this chic boutique hotel would of at least had some sort of system to notify two different staff members that a room was occupied. From that second forward I felt the need to put my double dead bolt on. Unreal. Sunday breakfast was dead in their restaurant. Our server was lovely and it was so sad to see the place empty. Over all this hotel is slick and very pretty but not worth the price for the lack of organization I experienced."
37,1463,"Oct 11 2008 	Party On!	We give this hotel three stars because as a hotel it is great, but it really depends upon what you are looking for. If you want a great place to party hop from, this is it! In seconds you are in one of the hippest bar scenes in Montreal, including an '80s club with people dancing on the bar, and several others that I am way to old for (I'm 38). For a rockin' getaway with very little sleep, this is great. My husband and I did not get in until 3:30 am either night. The first night we slept soundly-- no noise (Friday). Then NEXT night, there was a full-fledged party on our floor because of the wedding party staying in the hotel. Well, you can imagine that we wanted to sleep. Oh well, we couldn't, despite the ear plugs that are given out as a hospitality!  To cut down on the noise I suggest you ask for a room that is not above the bar or which opens up over the swank open-air bar in the hotel's lower level."
38,1463,"Oct 4 2008 	Noise is indeed an issue here be cautious!	I stayed at the Opus for 4 nights. When I entered my first room I was pleasantly surprised with how modern it was great decor, nice accents but unfortunately bad lighting.. the rooms were light deprived. My first room was overlooking St Laurent near the club. When midnight came i was awakened by NOISE! people fighting on the street, dance music and the INSANE beats of bass on the speakers. As others have mentioned on this board,, its Loud!! First night i got 2 hours sleep :( they encourage you to wear their ear plugs to sleep but cmon who wants to do that. The next day i complained and they moved me to a quieter room. Much better! My remaining 3 nights there was fine. Free wireless was provided in the lobby. The Japanese restaurant on the ground floor had delicious food! the best Steak and frites. Try the complimentary coffee machine on the ground floor, tea, expresso, cafe latte. Delicious chocolates are placed each night on your pillow.If you are a light sleeper even a heavier one please take caution with the noise. One last thing you can't beat this location! Its in the heart of everthing."
39,1463,"Sep 15 2008 	way too loud!	now i have to confess i didnt look at this website before booking this hotel - big mistake. we had a room on the first floor facing the inner courtyard aka the outside bar area. i cant believe people are stupid enough to stay at this hotel - they must have been like me and not read any reviews. it was so [--] loud - esp sat night when the weather was good and the bar in full swing. on the sat night, after having an admitedly quite tasty and reasonably priced cocktail at said bar we went to our room at 11pm, tried to watch a movie which still couldnt drown out the noise from the bar. it reminded me of staying in miami beach. in actual fact we were so exhausted every night we actually feel asleep - with the earplugs in of course. its a great area for shopping - but would never stay here again, unless perhaps in the winter when the outside bar area will be covered in snow and hence no music. the room was quite nice, very &quot;cool&quot; with chocolates every night and l'occtaine bath products, but the lighting was bad."
40,1463,"Aug 29 2008 	Real Disappointment	Having had a friendly telephone conversation with a member of the reservations staff to book my stay, I was looking forward to my first visit to Opus. The hotel's location is convenient to explore the city but the building is situated on a busy cross-roads with constant traffic heard throughout the building. The first suite I was shown to did not have a bath as requested and I was moved to a small standard room overlooking the courtyard. Luckily it was a Monday, the receptionist did not recommend rooms overlooking the courtyard from Thursday to Sunday due to the late night party in the bar below. I stayed in the room for 3 nights before moving to a suite with a bath which I had originally booked. The room was spacious but painted a lurid orange and overlooked a side street littered with refuse. The room was badly lit and had no privacy from onlookers. A majority of the staff were very unfriendly and two receptionists in particular were extremely inefficient in carrying out simple guest requests. The highlight of this hotel were the porters / bell boys who always had a smile of their faces, nothing was to much trouble for them. Shame about the others. A real disappointment."
41,1463,"Aug 23 2008 	Rock and Roll Hotel... You will NOT sleep.	I booked this hotel on Hotwire for a very low rate, otherwise the few bad reviews would have kept me away. Unfortunately, the bad reviews here are 100% correct so let me just recap.Don't go to this hotel if you plan on sleeping at night. Maybe if you want to sleep from 5am until noon, but otherwise forget it. The bass from the club is so loud it sounds like it's in your room (and our room was no where near the club!) Also, there were some people who snuck out onto the rooftop right outside our window and camped out there until 5am. Yes folks, 5 am - laughing and hollering and stomping their feet! The hotel puts earplugs in the room but they didn't help at all. Also our Hvac unit was broken so our room was 82 degrees. Phone was broken too so forget about calling the front desk to rat out the people on the roof.Pros: Door men are very helpful and friendly, especially Tony. We did complain about the intense heat in our room which the hotel staff did fix. We also complained about the rooftop partiers the next morning and within moments, staff was on site screwing the windows shut so that it couldn't happen again.Cons: WAY too much noise. Too many defects. Dull dim lighting in the bathroom so you can't make sure you look decent before you go out. The hotwire rate was nice, but you really do get what you pay for sometimes."
42,1463,Aug 6 2008 	I Loved it!	I loved everything about this hotel ... the location can't be beat ... our room was beautiful ... the service was great ... the restaurant was fantastic and the the outdoor lounge was perfect for spending time with friends having some cocktails and people watching!
43,1463,"Jul 20 2008 	great stay	had a great stay here recently. very modern, hip hotel. great for young (35 and down, no kids) travelers. didn't get a chance to check out the bars and restaurants in the hotel, but they seem very chic. rooms are very clean and decor is modern. within walking distance of restaurants and boutiques. not close to major tourist attractions, but close to metro station which is easy to navigate. service was great; front desk staff very nice and helpful. only complaints are that the rooms are very dark and breakfast is not included."
44,1463,"Jul 16 2008 	Amazing Location OK Hotel	I am not a high maintenance hotel stayer. I like modern, clean rooms with a location central to my interests. The Opus delivered on both of those. Having said that, there was one BIG problem. The sound!I am a 30 year old woman. I love to party and stay out late...however, when I am ready to go to sleep, I want to be able to. There are 2 sides to this hotel. One faces the ultra hip, posh, overly priced restaurant/club Koko..the other faces the busy street. I don't know how the sound is on the street side, but on the club side it's obnoxiously loud!! Until 3-4 am on the weekends and about 2 on the weeknights. One day, we had been sightseeing all day and wanted to ttake a nap to be ready to go out later. There was a wedding in the courtyard of the restaurant and they started playing music at 5-6 pm (and it was still going when we got home late night). The music was typical annoying wedding music and top it all off, we had to hear all the speeches in surround sound. The volume was 19 on a scale of 1-20. We were very irritated and did not feel rested upon leaving this hotel. The staff is on the snobby side, and definitely cater more to the trendsetters, than the average joes. Room service stops serving at 11 pm..at least if you're going to force me to stay awake hearing your music..feed me!BUT the location is fantastic!! A few blocks from St Denis and the Latin Quarter, right on St Laurent with limitless restaurants and bars, a few blocks from Old Montreal, Prince Arthur Street, St Catherine, the metro, buses etcI would not return to this hotel."
45,1463,"Jul 9 2008 	Loved  loved loved the Opus!!	My husband and I stayed at the Opus Hotel in Monteal -June 27-30th while enjoying the Montreal Jazz Festival. It was hard to leave the hotel!!! From entering the lobby, we had incredible service right from the moment we entereded the front doors. The front desk staff were efficient, welcoming and very polite. Security is great, since you require your room key to access your floor inside the elevator. Decor is great, ultra modern, a nice change from the &quot;typical&quot; decor of hotels. There is an area, just adjacent to the lobby where there is a free,fresh coffee and tea bar with very comfy sofas and chairs and free wireless hookups.The various daily papers are free as well.  Our room was just perfect!!! The colors are all spectacular and each is different, hot pink, mustard, chartrusse, and our was purple, mauve and grey! We loved it- the king bed was incredible, the linens were the best I've ever slept on in any hotel! (HMMMM- do they sell them?) The room was very large, comfortable, and a bonus was that the window opened-we stayed on the 4th floor overtop the covered patio area and off to a side street. We did not have any noise problems. Our window when closed was very soundproof. We also found an &quot;O&quot; umbrella in our closet - which came in very handy. The bath products are great, they use L'Occitane en Provence- very luxurious! Nice white fluffy bathrobes (with a lime green &quot;O&quot; -very cute)- huge shower was a nice treat too! The lighting in the room is great - no ceiling lights, but instead, lamps and recessed lighting in one wall behind the bed. In the evening we had turndown service with decadant chocolates on our pillow, soft romantic lighting, the beautiful copper roman shade drawn- and the silver ice bucket full- ready for our nightcaps!! The lounge and restaurant are elegant- the outdoor courtyard very stylish and one floor below at Suko's Lounge- the outdoor patio is just decadant- chaise lounges and pillows surrounded by a great garden area, accessable right to the street. We were only blocks away from the Jazz Fest and steps away from Old Montreal, fantastic shops, restaurants (Thanks to Fritz!! for the tips on breakfast and lunch spots!!) wine bars, great patios, I could go on and on. But bottom line, if you want to stay in a GREAT hotel, in a perfect location - you cannot miss with the Opus Hotel. We heard that they have an Opus in Vancouver and can't wait to experience the BC one soon!!"
46,1463,"Jul 5 2008 	Loved the Opus	Just returned from a two night stay at the Opus and could not have been happier with our choice. As always I use Tripadvisor as my guide before booking a hotel and although there have been a couple of poor ratings for this hotel it certainly was not our experience. The hotel is very modern, clean and staff extremely helpful from the front desk staff to the doormen. We did not experience any of the problems with sound in the room at all.Location is excellent.The only complaint I have is that the food and bar prices are &quot;way&quot; too high and would definitely not avail myself of either the restaurant or bar.Would stay here again."
47,1463,"Jun 3 2008 	Maybe for some people...	I booked my stay over a month in advance with Tablet Hotels. The money had been paid to the hotel in it's entirety 3 weeks before I had even arrived, yet there was no room waiting for me.I immediately noticed that Opus is definitely going for a specific clientele. Young professionals, or celebrities with money to burn will enjoy extra-special attention from the staff, while those like myself will get a bit of the old 'upturned nose' treatment. When I was finally able to get a room one of the concierge at the front desk said to me that he'd like to find me a quieter room, when he saw the one that was assigned by the woman who had originally greeted us, but was abruptly cut off by her as she told him that our room was &quot;fine&quot;.Beware that if you plan on going to bed before 3am, half of the hotel's rooms overlook the courtyard which Koko (the upscale yuppie hotel restaurant/nightclub) opens onto. Our room was the floor above the courtyard and was vibrating from the bass in the restaurant's sound-system and we could clearly hear the people in the courtyard smoking and yelling to one another over the music. When I called to ask for a different room, I was told that the hotel was &quot;Sold Out&quot;. This is a *likely story*.The decoration/design of this hotel is very trendy, and while it is nice right now, it is very dark and will date quickly.If you like to stay up late snorting coke, drinking awesome martinis and partying with other yuppies, you will love Opus Hotel in Montreal. This is not a family hotel, nor is it a hotel for people who like a peaceful or relaxing weekend away from home."
48,1463,"May 28 2008 	Nice Clean Friendly	My boyfriend and I visited Montreal and stayed at the Opus Hotel Montreal this past Memorial Day weekend. We were pleased with the hotel as far as cleanliness, friendliness (especially the front desk) and location. We were able to walk to many sights including museums, restaurants, etc. Everything else was a few minutes car ride away.Amenities in the room were L'Occitane and were very nice. The only complaint I have was the $26/night charge for valet parking. Even in a big city, this was too much in my opinion. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay (the complimentary coffee/espresso/capppuccino machine in the lobby was a very nice touch). The bar/lounge downstairs is nice, though the cocktails were quite pricey. However, we expected that in a big city. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
49,1463,"May 28 2008 	Do NOT Believe the other reviews WORST HOTEL WE EVER STAYED IN.	I am convinced that the other reviews that show this property in a positive light are either fake, written by management, or the hotel has some sort of policy to reward this fake praise. For the first time ever, I was completely duped by Tripadvisor, usually my wife and I have a great experience and the reviews are spot on, NOT this time. All I can say is, please, listen to me, do not stay at this property if you value your time, money, and sleep. Here is a list of the defects:1. The Hotel has terrible sound proofing. The club blasts club music until 3:30 and you will hear every word, feel every bass note, and generally feel like you're in the club even on floor 5. Even between rooms, expect to hear the neighbors having sex, and everything going on outside on the street. This is a problem ACKNOWLEDGED by management, which is why the put earplugs under your pillow. 2. The new eatery, KOKO, is a complete joke. In such a city which is rich in culinary skill, do not torture yourself by dining at this feeble attempt at gourmet. There was a mistake on our order, and the waiter then charged us to bring out the correct item. When asked to get a manager, he refused to call one. 3. The rooms have terrible lighting. No recessed lighting, and the fixtures are sparce, and the bulbs were burnt out during our stay. 3 days and 2 calls later to front desk for repair, still no lights. 4. Our safe didn't work. 5. Our egg room service breakfast came with no fork, knives, or napkin. 6. The finishes are very cheap, laminate counter tops on all the furniture, with the dark oak front edgband veneer peeling off in many places. Cheap doors, cheap trim, the bed frame has unfinished MDF showing around as the mattress doesn't cover it completely. Trend forward design gone very bad, think an &quot;IKEA hotel&quot;, but not as good. 7. The HVAC units are in room and very loud. 8. Our telephone didn't work, and was not fixed after 2 days. 9. Did I mention that you won't sleep?Overall, this place was a joke. When I was at the reception complaining, there were 2 people ahead of me, and I overheard them complaining for the same things. It defies logic how there are so many positive reviews. Save your money and your vacation time, stay elsewhere."
50,1463,"May 27 2008 	Great location good value contemporary hotel.	Perfect location if you're going to take advantage of the restaurants and shopping on St. Laurent. Intimate boutique hotel with a similar feel of the W, but a little more subdued. I like it and would definitely consider staying here again. Clean rooms, good sized and comfortable."
51,1463,"May 18 2008 	Great design hotel downtown Montreal	The Opus Montreal is located next to many bars, restaurants and shops. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and new like the rest of the hotel. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food at the restaurant is very good and the bar is nice."
52,1463,"May 7 2008	Hotel Opus - A Work in Progess - For the Better	The Opus is sleek, modern, airy, spacious, and dimly lit from the lobby all the way up to the hotel room. The staff is very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.The Opus is in the midst of constructing their restaurant that is expected to open by the end of May. Until then, at street level there is the Suco bar and lounge with an outdoor patio facing St. Laurent where you can enjoy great tunes, drinks, and tapas.If you are a light sleeper, make sure to use the ear plugs provided as the windows are not very soundproof and do not keep out the street noise. Regardless, the beds are very comfortable and the hotel room offers all of the latest modern amenities.Restaurants and shops along Ste-Laurent are all within a short walking distance from the Opus. For additional restaurants and shops and if you are not keen on walking, a short cab ride will get you to Old Montreal/the Port, Crescent Street, Ste-Catherine, and Ste-Denis.Nearby Dining: For a truly authentic excellent Italian meal cooked like mamma, be sure to make a reservation at Da Emma (514.392.1568) in Old Montreal. For a filling breakfast (served until 3:00 p.m.), lunch or dinner, check out the funky Avenue on Mt-Royal Avenue East (plus two additional locations) and have patience as they do not take reservations and there is always a line-up. It is worth the wait."
53,1463,"Jan 4 2008 	Very hip - A 'Must Stay' Hotel	This is a fantstic hotel - very chic, in a great location near everything, the staff is awesome and so extremely helpful. The rooms were so luxurious it was hard to leave the hotel and explore Montreal. We went for our 1st wedding anniversary and felt pampered the whole time we were at The Opus. We will definitely be staying at The Opus on every trip we make back to Montreal. We had a fantastic experience and wouldn't change anything about the hotel."
54,1463,"Dec 12 2007 	Awesome spot!	I stayed here for my bachelor party with about ten other guys. The hotel was very chic and yes I did say chic. Front desk staff helpful, and the doorman let us know all the good hot spots! Beds were comfy, rooms were neat. The TV/computer combo was a little hard to figure out after a bottle of alcohol had been consumed, but I'm sure it worked fine. They were very accomadating when asked for a lot of ice, a HUGE tray filled with ice was delivered in no time at all. All in all a great stay. I would return to the Opus becuase of its proximity to the local nightlife, and if it wasn't close, it was a quick cab ride wherever you wanted to go!"
55,1463,"Nov 26 2007	Pretty good	Excellent staff from the bellhops to the front desk, everyone was super courteous and very quick to help you out. The hotel decor was pretty nice, they are goin for that trendy NY look. We stayed in the executive suite which was two rooms, a living room and then bedroom with two bathrooms with included baths/showers. Lighting was bleh, to dark for me. Overall nice hotel room, looks like it had been partied in pretty good though but didn't bother me, hehe. Was expecting an IPOD dock of some sort, but i improvised and bought one of those ipod headphone jack to audio input wires and plugged into the back of the tv and bam! IPOD. Have a ton of pics of the room if anyone is interested."
56,1463,Nov 19 2007 	Exceptional!	First time visit to Montreal and what an incredible city! And the trendy Opus Montreal matches its host city in everyway. The dcor in the rooms and lobby was vibrant and fun. Staff were friendly and very helpful with directions plus some outstanding dinner recommendations. Location was perfect  right next to a whole bunch of great shops and restaurants/clubs.
57,1463,"Nov 18 2007 	Dark but overall pleasant place to stay	I stayed at Hotel Godin (now Opus) twice earlier this year--once in February and once in June. Both were business trips.Some aspects of this hotel I really liked, others not.The rooms ARE dark, mostly due to concrete ceilings that mean no overhead lights. (Plus everything is painted in gray tones.) Also, huge windows are shrouded in very dark curtains. This might be great if you need pitch-dark to sleep, but a bit oppressive for being in the room at other times. I immediately opened all curtains, and that helped, but people could then look right in, from the place across the way, so I had to remember to change in the bathroom or close the curtains!Both times I was in what they call a &quot;Privilege&quot; room--that's the smallest. Bed was great--that's important! And chocolate treats at turn-down were a nice touch.The pictures show a bathtub, but neither room I had included one--only a shower, although a spacious one.There is a nice long desk, which was good for working. One trip I was able to negotiate internet to be included in the room cost, but the other time I had to pay a daily fee. No coffee maker, but there is free coffee in the lobby downstairs. Room service is - as you might expect - expensive. Plus, fairly small portions. Fortunately, there are lots of places to eat within walking distance. Still, overall it was a pretty good experience."
58,1463,"Nov 16 2007	Mini Ian Shrager?	Lots of rave reviews, but I thought it was trying a bit too hard to be 'New York'......constant 'cool' hotel music everywhere you go, the bar just doesn't quite cut it.....not saying it was bad - it was fine - but it aint Schrager/Stark even tho it wants to be.But having said that, at $179 maybe you cant expect the real thing?"
59,1463,"Nov 14 2007 	Location Location Location	For my first visit to Montreal, the Opus Hotel was the ultimate choice because it's location was close to everything. We only had a few days to stay in Montreal, so the location of our hotel was very important. The Opus Montreal was a short walk to shopping, and had many restaurants nearby. Most of our travel to and from the hotel was by taxi and was usually under a $10 fare, whether it was to a restaurant, nightclub, or the Bell Centre hockey arena.The rooms were funky and spacious but we did not spend a lot of time in them as we were enjoying everything cultural that Montreal has to offer. When we needed a dinner reservation, the staff were friendly, helpful, and bi-lingual.I will stay there again."
60,1463,"Nov 14 2007 	Awesome.	From the moment we got out of the taxi, the Opus staff were very attentative and helpful. The entire time it felt as though we were receiving special treatment - even though we were regular guests. The lobby is beautiful, but not over done - they have a small bar/lounge in the lobby area and a larger bar downstairs - so great for pre-dinner drinks. The rooms are unique, new and stylish - loved the concrete ceilings. They are opening a larger bar in the spring which will make the Opus even more of a hot-spot. I highly recommend this hotel, and I will be staying there every time I go to Montreal."
61,1463,"Nov 11 2007 	Exactly what I wanted!!!	Couldn't have asked for anything better! The service was excellent, the employees were courteous, and the room exceded all expectations!! Highly Recommended! I've been to a couple hotels in montreal, nothing compared to Opus!!!"
62,1463,"Oct 29 2007 	Hip Cool Great Location	Perfect spot if you're looking for a hip hotel located in the heart of the coolest neighbourhood in Montreal filled with great stores, restaurants, etc. Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, quiet, high end with nice personal touches. Great bar scene!"
63,1463,"Oct 22 2007 	Loved the Opus Montreal!	Amazing staff, very helpful and friendly. Opus is very chic and modern. I was traveling for business and found the location was perfect---very centrally located to all the main attractions and neighbourhoods. Some hotels have fantastic lobbies and then boring rooms but not at Opus! My room was amazing and so were the bathroom products. I especially enjoyed turn-down service; each night when I returned from a day of meetings there were delicious chocolates on my pillow! Love, love, love Opus Montreal and will definitely be staying there again when I am in Montreal for work (or even just for fun!). Note: Room service was very good, the tip/delivery charge is included on the bill so you don't pay all those hidden charges that come with most room service bills. If you are traveling alone like I was, have a drink in the lobby lounge, the staff are really friendly and offer great wine suggestions."
64,1463,"Oct 21 2007	romantic getaway	My husband and I spent our 1 year wedding anniversary at Opus. it was truly a romantic experience. The hotel itself is just beautiful and the staff was just great. We stopped for a few drinks at Suco bar which is in Opus hotel. The ambience was great. The bar tenders were so friendly and ready to serve you whenever you needed a drink. The music was really good. It was that lounging music you want to hear when you are out having a good time. The music wasn't too lound like some bars that you can't even hear yourself think. You can actually have a conversation with the people you are with. Right after a fun evening we headed to our room which was just to die for. Modern, clean and comfortable. I just wanted to stay in there comfy bed all day long. The room was a good size and the bathroom was bigger then the room.(almost) Deep bathtub, huge shower and 2 sinks so I didn't have to fight over it with my husband. Ha! Ha!. We pre ordered our breakfast the night before, but I forgot to write the time I wanted it served to our room. So when I woke up I called reception and they told me I forgot to write a time and they didn't want to call us to wake us up, which I found very respectfull of them. Within minutes our breakfast arrived on a table with flours, fruit, croissants, muffins, juice, coffee and of course my bacon and eggs. The presentation was just beautiful and added to our romatic weekend. All in all I reccommend Opus Montreal to not only couples but to anyone who wants to stay at a really nice hotel and have a good evening at the bar.It also is located in the heart of town town Montreal, which is the place to be. I defiately would go back. Maybe every anniversary!"
65,1463,"Oct 15 2007	Amazing Energy!	The OPUS Montreal pulses with an amazing energy. For a trendy boutique hotel the rooms are a lovely size - with great features including an amazing tub/shower room! (check out the cool reversible door- hinge on the wc/bedroom door!) This time it was only my husband and me, but after peeking into one of the suites (complete with murphy bed) we've vowed to go back soon with kids! And talk about location... you want the heart off Montreal - you got it!!!"
66,1463,"Oct 9 2007 	Outstanding...	only amazing things to say about the hotel, the property, and the staff. there is a really great story about the history of the building which definately adds to the experience. located in a wonderful, central part of town. we were there is the fall and it was just beautiful.nothing bad to say about opus montreal."
67,1463,"Oct 4 2007 	Hip happening hot	Montreal's hippest hotel. Incredibly friendly (and gorgeous) staff. As someone else said, it's a celebrity haven - you never know who you'll meet in the lobby or the elevator. The beds are heavenly."
68,1463,Sep 28 2007	Loved Opus Montreal!!!!!!!!	Last weekend was my bachelorette party and a bunch of us stayed at the opus hotel in montreal...BEST hotel EVER!!!! The staff is amazing!... the rooms are incredible! and the service rocked! I had a great time and a very enjoyable stay!! I recommend the opus montreal to everyone and anyone!! you can't go wrong!!
69,1463,"Sep 25 2007 	Celebrities everywhere! Best location!	I recently went to Montreal to see the Beastie Boys concert and stayed at the Opus Montreal. I was blown away to see that I was staying in the same hotel as the Beastie Boys... and what more? I even met Bjork in the lounge!!!! All the shopping and restaurants were around the corner and to top it all of I was greeted and taken care of with such professionalism, and slept in the best bed ever! Easily my best vacation, will be returning for the Jazz Festival!"
70,1463,"Sep 11 2007 	Excellent Boutique Hotel	I am a gay traveller and also owner of a Travel Agency. The OPUS Hotel Montreal has exceeded my expectations, not only on the design, services and location, but also on the Guest and Customer Service. The staff is very friendly, warm and welcoming.I would recommend any of you seeking the best value option to stay in Montreal the OPUS Hotel not only as a guest/client of the hotel but also as a travel expert.Excellent location, walking distance from the main touristic atractions, the restaurant districts, and the gay quarters for the gay travellers.FYI it is not a Gay hotel, but you can sence the friendly ambience in the air.I give them a 09 point out of 10.Carlos Melia"
71,1463,"Sep 9 2007 	Absolutely Amazing !	As of hotel staying, you might call me a professional. I stay in hotels more than in my own home ! If I had the chance to choose a permanent destination, Opus Montreal would definitely be it !From the warmful welcoming to the prompt check-out, my &quot;too short&quot; stay at Opus charmed me, from top to bottom !Considering the busy Labor Day weekend, the staff was available for any requests and ready to perform backward flips for all my little personal attentions. I felt just at home in the beautiful rooms... major plus with the glass shower !I could go on but will keep it short. Opus MTL is THE boutique hotel to choose to keep a sane mind about your staying needs !Thank you Opus !Ian RenaudFood Critic for Gastronomie, Weekend.ca"
72,1463,"Sep 8 2007 	Fantastic Opus Montreal	From the moment my family and I (two small children 4yrs and 5yrs old) entered the hotel, we were welcomed with open arms. The staff was very courteous and professional. All the elements from the lighting to the dcor were warm, welcoming and very hip.The rooms have an element of style that made our stay very pleasant. My daughters love the comfy beds and so did I. The staff was always quick to respond to all our needs with a smile. I will be returning to Montral very soon and I wont be looking to stay anywhere else."
73,1463,"Sep 7 2007	Loved the Opus Montreal (formerly Hotel Godin)	We just returned from an extended weekend stay with the Opus Montreal (formerly Hotel Godin). It was a very conveniently location -- close to the Metro and restaurants. The staff members were very professional, courteous, helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. We especially loved the evening bed turn down treats!"
74,1463,"Sep 6 2007 	Cool Modern Hotel Great Location	Hip boutique hotel. Our room was nicely equipped. basically a queen bed with two bed-side tables, a table and chairs, a very large, very long polished metal mirror that took up one whole wall, flat screen TV, long wood consoe (12' long) was very useful. The only downside of the hotel was the room was very dark, even with all the lights on, it was occasionally difficult to read. Hip and romantic though. The walls and the cieling are poured concrete, very dark. The toilet was in a separate room from the shower/vanity area. The shower/vanity was very nice with a large shower area with glass tile, the vanity had a large raised vessell sink and plenty of room on each side. Real positive was the location right on St. Laurent and Sherbrooke, close to Old Montreal, downtown, and our favorite part the plateau, St. Laurent, St. Denis, Mt. Royal. Very convenient location, helpful staff. WiFi did not work in room, had to go to the lobby for that, a bit annoying. Fitness center was small, but nicely equipped and never crowded and open 24 hrs. I specifically do not eat in the restaurant of the hotel I'm staying in (part of the fun is getting out and about), so I have no opinon on that. Convenient valet parking, very helpful. One Word Equity: Location. with a nice dose of hipness. Would definately recommend to the right person (not my parents) looking for a nicely located, moderately priced, hip boutique type hotel, but would not be everyone's cup of tea."
75,1463,"Sep 6 2007	Worst Managed Hotel in Montreal	I am a huge fan of boutique hotels and I travel to Montreal frequently. Opus (formerly known as the 'Godin') is quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever been to. The service from check-in to check-out was tedious, annoying and unprofessional.My credit card statement showed that they had charged my account double the amount that they were supposed to. It took two weeks and numerous litigation for me to receive my money.Funny thing - is that I had heard about the hotel being poorly managed, but I didn't listen - BIG mistakeUntil they wipe out their management system - stay clear!"
76,1463,"Sep 4 2007 	Stunning!	A must stay!The perfect location! Close to downtown shopping, nightlife, restaurants and the plateau, a must see of Montreal. Beautiful and trendy decor, professional, friendly staff.A must stay in Montreal."
77,1463,"Jul 30 2007 	Opus Hotels expands in Montreal	A recent addition to the Opus Hotel Group. The former Godin Hotel Montreal is a v. good place to rest your head. Designed by Canadian Architects Yabu Pushelburg it is well thought out and planed. The basic rooms (Prestige) are large. The service is friendly and professional. My complaint here is that the hotel seems understaffed and requests seem to take a a long time. Well located near the St Laurent restaurant scene the hotels own restaurant is not yet open for business. My only real complaint was the poor quality of the breakfast buffet. Un inspiring choices, cheap linen and poor coffee. Come on guys you are in Montreal. Montreal bagels and pastries, fressh fruit and linen and lose the stainless steel serving bowls ! All in all a good choice. If your journey takes you to Montreal look over The Sofitel, W Hotel and in the old town Le St James,Nelligan and The Saint Sulpice. Enjoy Montreal !"
78,1463,"Jul 29 2007 	Great location	The location of the Godin, sorry Opus (the hotel had just changed ownership as I was staying there), is superb.It's about 4 blocks away from the main shopping street (St. Catherine) and right across the hotel, there's a street full of great bars and restaurants. The location cant be beat, there's everything nearby that you might want. While the hotel is located next to a busy street, once you get indoors, it's all peace and quiet.The lobby has a bar in the evenings and there's always free coffee available which was quite good. I ended up drinking a lot of it since the I couldn't get the internet connection working for my laptop up in my room. The wifi access in the lobby is free and fast. To use the internet in the rooms you have to activate it via the tv and it didnt work at all for me or any of my colleagues.The room I stayed in was spacious and had a massive comfy bed. Its pretty dark in the room and the only window was facing an closeby office and the street, from where one could see into the room, so the shades had to be kept down most of the time. The decoration is pretty basic. It's not the &quot;friendliest&quot; hotel room you are going to be staying in.The bathroom was spartan but big. The toiletries were fine and there was plenty of towels. The toilet was in a room across the bath and interestingly there's one door that was the door for the toilet and the living room, which was a bit weird.There's a restaurant downstairs that served up a tasty if limited continental breakfast. The staff very very courteous and friendly."
79,1463,"Jul 8 2007 	Great location and very interesting design	Hotel Godin is a beautiful full service hotel, on the level of perhaps a Westin, but slightly less expensive. The interiors are very interesting, with muted colors and bare concrete. I could have used a bit more light in the guestrooms. But service was great and you certainly can't beat the location right on St. Laurent. Underground parking is available, but PRICEY at 25 CAN a night."
80,1463,"Jul 6 2007	Godin = excellent hotel would stay here again in a heartbeat	Excellent hotel. Pay no mind to the Internet naysayers who say that this was missing or that that was terrible or whatever. This place was excellent, the staff and service was excellent, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended."
81,1463,"Jul 4 2007 	Godin for Jazz Festival	We stayed at the Hotel Godin for the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and chose it for its great location (only 2 blocks from the festival, and a few blocks from Rue St. Denis) and its mod styling. The lobby and lounge area are cool, and you can enjoy free espresso and free wireless internet access. There is also a bar in the lobby that is open until 11pm. The rooms are cool and have a nice minimalist styling, and the ceilings are poured concrete with builder notations scribbled on them (which we thought was cool). The beds are very comfortable, and you will find a free newspaper outside your room each morning. The finish isn't quite up to par with other mod-styled hotels like the W, but it's also a little less expensive. The staff are very friendly. There is a club/ lounge/ bar downstairs, but it didn't seemed to be open during our stay. Also, plan on having breakfast elsewhere, unless you've always wanted to try a $25 omelette (check out La Brioche Lyonnaise on St. Denis for some good local breakfast grub)."
82,1463,"Jun 29 2007 	Nickel and Dime	A very nice, stylish hotel that tries its best to nickel and dime you to death. Granted, this is increasingly common in today's world of travel, but, when you pay $250 a night for a room, you'd think they'd throw in a bottle of water or internet access.Water is $2.50 a small bottle. Although they're free in the workout room, which is nearly always empty. Internet access is $10 a day, something that's not mentioned in any of the hotel literature. There is FREE wireless access in the lobby, but they always keep the techno-music blaring (even at 4 a.m.). A glass of wine in the lobby is $12. Champagne $24.Staff is helpful but typically dense in a young person sort of way. Room pricing is all over the chart depending on where you look. In May, the Hotel Godin website listed rooms at $279. Travelocity had the same room for $225. Expedia had it at $179.All that said, The Godin is conveniently located and nicely run, but you'll come away with the sense that you've been ripped off even though you've probably had a great time."
83,1463,"Jun 25 2007 	Service location style...	The hotel's location is second to none. Close to downtown, the village, Saint Laurent night life, underground city and all major attractions Montreal has to offer. The room was super comfortable, a mixture of old features that made a bold statement (i.e. the ceiling was unfinished, yet the decor of the room was stylish and didn't sacrifice comfort). The bathroom was spacious and super clean. Service is definitely key, we were given directions to everything, and the staff always went above and beyond the call of duty to our every need. Will definitely be back."
84,1463,"May 30 2007 	Loved the Godin	Went to Montreal this past weekend with a girlfriend! we loved the Godin. Room 240 was gorgeous, the bathroom unbelievable! As other reviews mentioned, lighting was a bit of an issue. If you don't mind noise, then the hotel location wont bother you. Street noise is really load. Not the hotels fault just the location. If you want to be in the action, this is perfect. Service was fair, depending on who you get I suppose. i called for a saftey pin, and the girl I spoke to was wonderful! Then I went to Front desk to let them now our A/C wasn't turning on , and she didn't really care at all. Everything in Montreal is extremely laid back anyways. We found service to be slow everywhere we went. Overall I would stay at this hotel again."
85,1463,"May 28 2007 	Poor service poor value go somewhere else for this price	We stayed for a weekend in cold, snowy February. Booked two rooms. The hotel is overpriced for the service levels - we've since been in the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and it is sooo much better. Go to another hotel - plenty of better choices within the price range, and while the location is good, so are most locations in Montreal - it is a liveable city!1) Valet parking were NOT friendly, access is difficult on busy Sherbrooke if a car or two are already &quot;dropping off&quot; guests - there was quite a mistake with the valets and it ended up on a double billing at the end of the stay. ... that would have been a pardonable mistake but...2) No coffee or cookies in the lobby, despite them being advertised on both the website and the hotel brochures. Cold light-couloured brew was sitting for hours... no amenities of that sort in-room (no coffee maker basics)3) Rooms look and feel rather drab than &quot;chic&quot;, and the dark colours only seem to mask the dirt. However, I agree that the bed/ mattress was firm and linen pleasant.4) Poor sound insulation between walls - we shared the next-door neighbours &quot;sweet valentine&quot; exploits - I must say we got jealous! Unfortunately it didn't help us get sleep...5) The restaurant wasn't open and part of the hotel was &quot;under construction&quot; - yet they still dared to charge full-price...poor.Overall I would not go back to this hotel, it is overpriced and the level of service and overall &quot;feeling&quot; isn't up to snuff for what they charge or for what they presume to be. Plenty of better choices in Montreal."
86,1463,"May 9 2007 	Cool Canadian Chic	The Godin is a very modern spin on a boutique hotel. Lots of glass, chrome and dark colours. If you don't see beauty in different shades of grey then this hotel isn't for you. It is fair to say that the rooms and the lounges could do with more light - suffice to say that the bare concrete ceiling (it was supposed to be like that) in the room didn't have a light fitting in it. Nevertheless, the hotel is well appointed and the decor is tatsteful and eventually grows on you.The lobby has free wireless internet and an expresso machine. If you time it right you get free cakes as well! Staff are friendly and if you speak kindly to the maids they will you extra chocolates when they turn your bed down!Location is good, very close to lots of restaurants and bars on Rue St Laurent. However, the metro stations are a couple of blocks away.Overall, an enjoyable experience in a classy city hotel."
87,1463,"Mar 30 2007	Decent but not the value it used to be.	I've stayed twice at the Hotel Godin, in September 2005 and October 2006. The first stay was amazing. The second stay was decent. The pluses during both stays were the perfect location; the quality of the bed, shower and amenities; and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. What made the second stay less positive was the decline in value. During the first stay, free bottled water was available in the lobby and the room, a continental breakfast was included in the room rate, and front of the line passes to restaurant/clubs owned by the Godin owners were given out to guests. By the time of the second stay majority ownership had changed and all these were no longer available. So the Hotel Godin is a decent hotel and if you like modern hotels and want to be close to nightlife and good restaurants and a reasonable walk away from the Latin Quarter, Chinatown, and the touristy old town, you'll enjoy a stay there."
88,1463,"Mar 10 2007 	Dark rooms where is the doorman?!	First impression was &quot;where is the doorman or bellman?!?!&quot;. I had lots of luggage and trying to cart it in the slushy side walk by myself. People at the front desk saw that and didn't help! I would understand if they were busy with guests but both were just standing there chatting away. The rooms were very dark. I loved the bathroom except just like the bedroom it was dark, I suggest ladies to apply make up in front of the window! Based on their website I thought they would still have Fresh products. There seemed to be a recent change in amenities to Gilcrhrist &amp; Soames, such a shame... Continental breakfast served downstairs was very good. I almost wanted to ask what bakery bakes their bread! Service was very good too. I loved the location. Close to fantastic restaurants and a couple of trendy stores. I can imagine staying at this hotel in the summer would be fantastic."
89,1463,"Jan 29 2007 	Fantastic	Hotel Godin is great. Good Location, real slick looking lobby, helpful staff, excellent breakfast, and fantastic rooms. There is no other place to stay in Montreal accept this place. Right at the foot of the shops, restraunts, bars, and clubs on St. Laurent and a short walk to St. Catherine. You won't be dissapointed"
90,1463,"Jan 1 2007 	Fantastic location great stay	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Godin over Christmas for 4 days. The hotel was great. Its location on Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was in the center of the great restaurants and bars. The decor was ultra-modern and the prices of in-room services followed that. Room service was ridiculous... $25-$35 entrees. Breakfast for ONE person cost us $25. This could be temporary, since the hotel's restaurant and bar is not yet open.Apart from that, we felt like we were staying in a hotel that was much more expensive than what we actually paid. Hotel + Flight from NYC was $500 each for 4 nights. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Ask for Jean-Pierre at the concierge.. he was extremely helpful and accomodating."
91,1463,"Nov 6 2006 	Loved it!	Hotel Godin was a great stay! Like everyone else has pretty much said, the rooms are a bit dark BUT, the rooms were clean and the furniture was chic and modern. I felt very comfortable staying. Also, the staff was absolutely friendly and helpful! They suggested places for my boyfriend and I to eat. From the manager to the bellboy(especially the bellboy), everyone was absolutely interested in making sure that my boyfriend and I had everything from reservations to directions. I can't rave enough about this place. Maybe my boyfriend and I got really lucky in meeting all the right staff but we really loved the whole staff/room/hotel itself. The location is really great too because its right on the corner of two major streets of Montreal! you are just walking distance of SO many clubs/restaurants/shops!It's a shame that this hotel has so much potential. They couldn't get their liquor license so there is this HUGE space for where the restaurant should be...along with the bar. Because of this, hotel Godin is a hidden GEM! My boyfriend and I will most definitely go back! Thank you to other trip advisors who contribute!"
92,1463,"Oct 30 2006 	Don't bother	What a let down! Hotel Godin is overrated. On the plus side, it is new, well located and clean. However, most of the rooms do not have bath; rooms are dark; when you lay down on the bed and look at the ceiling you would think that you are sleeping in the parking garage (no paint, no ceiling, just ciment!). Good luck if you want to shave or put make up in the washroom...it is so dark....The service was poor. It called itself a boutique-hotel...it is not. Don't bother. Go elsewhere."
93,1463,"Oct 18 2006	Nice Stay	After reading a few reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided to book my reservation. It basically met my expectations. Nothing great, nothing bad either. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:-Location-Price-Service-Amenities: Nice gym, toiletries, etc.-StyleCons:-Dark rooms"
94,1463,"Oct 4 2006 	location location	Situated on the corner of St Laurent and Sherbrooke, there is no better location than the Godin to begin a night on the town. The rooms and lobby are well designed, with the ambiance of a locally owned boutique hotel. The clientele is exactly what you want to see (no cheesy corporate types!). The staff are friendly and helpful. On a lesser note, I am tired of the nickel and diming the better hotels are charging for internet access. It should be free, and at the Godin, it's overpriced. In the past, the staff encouraged me to have breakfast for free, yet on my last trip, after having my breakfast, I was charged, and told that they now charge the guests (it would've been nice to know before eating a banana and a croissant for $14).  Regardless, I much prefer the Godin to the W, as it is a true Montreal establishment that seems to be waiting to flourish, as a major nightclub/hotel phenomenon. I believe it will. And as I said, the location is perfect for enjoying the nightlife."
95,1463,Aug 12 2006 	Great atmosphere - very trendy	I travel alot for work and as I love Montreal I wanted to find a hotel that would be different and Montrealer. I had heard of the Hotel Godin but now after having experienced it I will definitely go back. Everyone was very professional - the service was friendly - I loved the lounge area in the lobby and the european style breakfast. Very modern and clean. Great location as you are able to walk almost anywhere downtown Montreal. Very safe area with lots of trendy restaurants and bars. I will definitely be going back next time I am in the montreal!
96,1463,"Aug 7 2006	Hotel Godin-Best Kept Secret	We had booked a last minute trip to Montreal Aug 5-7, '06. 1/2 business 1/2 pleasure. Having heard of a 100+ room boutique hotel in the downtown area, we thought it was worth a try. What a refreshing experience. From the cool music, chic and smooth lobby, to the well dressed employees, I haven't felt more welcomed in a hotel in years. The room was a little larger than a standard size with dark purples and greys-very different. Black tiles in the bathroom with a glass shower and funky sinks. Every hallway we walked down there was a staff member that smiled.It was within walking distantce-15 minutes to Old Montreal where was a bounty of great restaruants and cafes. Up the street is Sofia's for a great bowl of Goat cheese ravioli and bottle of Vino. A little expensive...but worth it. We went the the hotel restaurant for breakfast which was bright and airy-the server had the sliding doors open to the street. My most pleasant surprise was when we came back to the room both nights and found the room turned down, ice in the buckets, curtains drawn and a treat of chocolates on the pillow. Very welcoming as our feet were sore from walking all day. Didn't find a pool as I dont think they had one. Some planned reno's attachd to the builing are apparently for a banquet hall. I'm glad we went out of our way to try it. Too often we stay at the same chains and are tired of it. Too bad about the taxi's-I've never been for whiplashed so bad coming back from the casino last night. LAstly, go for the espresso in the lobby..."
97,1463,"Jul 26 2006 	Great alternative to the ""beige box""!	If you are looking for an alternative to the &quot;beige box&quot; this is it! Modern and cool yet comfortable with fast, efficient service. Loved the fluffy duvet &amp; pillows, the simple, elegant decor, modern technology and the spa like shower. Would recommend coffee maker in the room as well as more lighting. Great location for shopping &amp; dining."
98,1463,"Jul 6 2006	Way Overrated	Uninformed reviews appear to put the Godin at the head of the pack of Montreal's trendy boutique hotel market. Clearly, those reviewers haven't experienced the Godin firsthand. Service is terrible; the concierge consistently screwed up our dinner reservations, the front desk was alerted about luggage arriving from the airport and we asked them to phone the room when it arrived, but no one ever did.On top of all of that, the Godin's supposed &quot;pluses&quot; were conspicously absent. Cool bar? Nope, not open. Restaurant? Closed. Wireless internet? Not in the rooms, and wired internet access available for a hefty $13 a night. The room keys got demagnetized on a regular basis. Not to mention very dark rooms which, even with all the lights turned on, were still dank and depressing (rather than &quot;trendy&quot;) at night, even during the day.I stayed at the St-Paul just two months prior and for the same price there is no comparison. The St-Paul had a charming staff, which were HELPFUL, not to mention a fully licensed bar and restaurant, beautiful rooms, free internet access, and character missing from the Godin.The Godin had one factor which set it apart from the other boutique hotels in a good way - its location on St-Laurent and Sherbrooke (rather than in the ubiquitous Old Port like every other boutique hotel) made the Plateau, Mile End, Downtown, Old Port and the Village accessible by easy walk. Too bad the hotel is so disappointing!"
99,1463,"Jul 5 2006	We liked it but there are some things you should know	My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Godin from June 30 to July 4. We paid about $215 a night plus $25 a night for parking.LocationIt is definitely better to be in this part of town instead of Old Montreal. Old Montreal is beautiful but it's a place for tourists and does not feel like a real, vibrant city. Godin's neighborhood, Plateau Mont Royal, is half cool and half lame. Unfortunatley Godin is closer to the lame half but is sitll closer to the good half than any hotel i know of. The bad half is Ste Laurent, the street next to the hotel which is often referred to as &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;cool.&quot; I may be a jaded New Yorker, but i found most of Ste. Laurent to be cheesy and soulless. All the restaurants were playing bad house music and were filled with tacky furniture. But don't be discouraged. The cool half of the Plateau is just a few blocks further to the corner of Duluth and Dorlet streets. This area has beautiful parks and residential architecture. The restaurants were sophisticated, authentic, and had great food. I especially recommend L'Express and Laloux. ServiceEveryone we encountered was friendly and professional. The concierge wasn't around too often but the people at the reception desk were always able to answer our questions. RoomThe room is VERY dark. It's even hard to read unless it's daylight and the shades are up. It was frustrating that there was no translucent curtains that would allow light in but not allow people to see in. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was slick but usable.Food/DrinksThe hotel is not finished yet. There is no sign of construction but large portions of the hotel are empty and unused for no apparent reason. The hotel also doesn't seem to have a liquor license or serve dinner. This wasn't a big factor for us but would be a huge turn-off for someone traveling alone who wanted to meet people in the hotel. The place was a ghost town except during the free breakfast (which was very good)."
100,1463,"Jul 5 2006	Great Room. Depressing Hotel. Bad Shower	My partner and I stayed at the Godin over the July 4th weekend. We decided to come up from New York to check out Montreal. We didn't find the city to our liking (too many depressing buildings and tacky-ness.) The people were blankly nice, but not overwhelming helpful. It seemed as though nobody had any enthusiasm for their own city. This extended to the staff at the Godin. There was no attempt made to help us out in terms of discovering the city. There was no knowledgable concierge on hand to make recommendations. And St. Laurent St.....sad little clubs and gaudy restaurants. not very hip.We bought a bottle of Vodka and holed up on our bed (which is super-comfy) and padded around the nice room. The shower DOES blow though. It's not for tall people and the water pressure is terrible. The room service menu is way overpriced for such a low-rent place. I think it was 24 bucks for a burger.The overall interior design of the hotel is college modern art museum meets new college dorm complex. there is way too much space. no intimacy. aside from a few Ligne Roset lamps in lobby, there is nothing here to shout about. the breakfast room is inversely large in proportion to the selection of food there (no meat, sad little croissants, limited fresh fruit)The exterior of the hotel is pretty joyless as well. Right across from an Esso station. Like an office building. It's not a site to behold and make you think &quot;great....we are at our hotel&quot;.We stumbled through Jazzfest one day. Such a blight. Spilling from St. Catherine to that horrible Place de la Artes. Concrete drabness. Badly dressed people. Soprano Sax....We left the hotel as early as possible and hung out at the airport all day."
101,1463,"Jun 24 2006	Lovin' Godin	Just spent two wonderful nights at the Godin this past week. This is a very cool, comfortable hotel with a location that cannot be beat at the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent.Best Things:- Super comfortable beds- Large Bathrooms with fogless mirrors- Fresh bath products- Complimentary breakfast in the bar- Cool lobby with mood lighting at nightThings to Improve:- Bar is not open yet but will be soon- No restaurant (maybe next year)The bar and restaurant situation is not a big deal considering some of Montreal's best restaurants and bars are a 2.5 minute walk from the hotel (check out Time Cafe, Madonna did when I was there) The staff was very attentive and helpful, and had lots of suggestions for restaurants and things to do. My room was super quiet with a nice mix of materials: wood, carpet and a concrete ceiling. I can't wait to go back to Montreal and when I do I will be staying at Hotel Godin."
102,1463,"Jun 16 2006 	a Wannabee Hotel	Before I arrived somebody told me it was a wannabee hotel. It was only after my arrival I understood what he meant. This hotel wants to be fancy but it isn't. It wants to be trendy but it isn't. It is build with cheap materials, has no isolation and if you look very carefully it is actually very poor. To make everything worse it is ran by people that apparently have no experience in the hotel business. It misses the class and charm of a good hotel and scores zero when it comes to service. Can you imagine a breakfast room with no coffee spoons around? Can you imagine the sprinkler of the shower mounted to low on the wall so you can not properly shower? can you imagine to wake up by people going to the bathroom in the room above (you think that a complete bathtub is falling on your head)? Can you imagine people from the reception not calling you back after you called them with a specific request? Only looking at the rates you realise why they actually &quot;want to be&quot;. Unfortunately they aren't and the next time I will stay as before at Le Germain. Probably one of the best hotels and not only in Montral..."
103,1463,"Jun 4 2006	The love is gone...	As a travel writer, who has stayed from 5-star hotels to youth hostels, I don't expect too much from my accommodations besides a comfy bed and warm shower. Until, that is, I stayed at Le Godin in Montreal, Canada. Besides the trendy lobby, chic rooms and beautiful staff (which I have seen from New York City to Bombay), there was only one very special feature which really made my stay there unforgettable. Only one thing that spoiled me beyond any other hotel I've stayed at. It was the hotel's star concierge, Anna.As I am always travelling to cities for one or two days at a time, nights spent alone eating room service is common practice. When Anna found out that this was my first trip to Montreal and that I was there on my own, she went out of her way to make a full-day itinerary for me, covering day trips to museums and shopping, to the nightlife of eateries and clubs. She explained, and truthfully, that Montreal was a city to be experienced at all hours. She even made sure to call all the places I was visiting ahead of time to let them know that I was coming and to treat her guest exceptionally well. She even passed by to see me during dinner to make sure that my day had gone well. It had, and very well in fact. As soon as I was back home, I booked another trip back to Montreal in 2 months time.Well, was I shocked to learn that upon arrival in Montreal, Anna was no longer working at Le Godin. What's more, her entire position had been eliminated. A concierge was deemed as &quot;not necessary&quot; at this chic hotel, where clients expect a high level of service (as confessed by one of the remaining staff). Long gone is the specialized attenton to each customer. Long gone is the much-needed advice and suggestions offered on the beautiful city of Montreal. Long gone are the kind words and pleasant smiles of Anna. It is safe to say that my second trip to Montreal fell far short of my first visit. This second encounter has not soured my taste for Montreal, but the same can't be true for Le Godin. Without Anna, this boutique hotel falls short on all points, especially customer service. The new management, which swept in and eliminated Anna and her position, has buried itself in quick sand. As a travel writer, whose job it is to make recommendations on where to stay in international cities, I am stating to you, as I did to my colleagues, family and friends, save yourself the trouble of bad service and foolish management and don't stay at Le Godin. The Comfort Inn would be a better bet, in my opinion. My mission, since the day I found out that Anna was no longer at this hotel, is to find her and take all my business to her new employer. Stay tuned for my next entry... I'll let you know where this jewel of a concierge is hiding."
104,1463,"May 31 2006 	Cool but things you should know.....no booze!	The Godin is designed as a cool, boutique style (read dark wood, polished concrete and fresh white linen) hotel, and it works on that level. The reception area is airy and welcoming, but we had read about the famous 'in room check in' and there was no sign of it despite the hotel not being too busy. The rooms are spacious with really comfortable beds, but no tea or coffee facilities and the wireless access didn't work in my room.Breakfast is pretty good - toast, cheese, fruit, fresh bread and pastries - but the bran muffins weren't at all tasy and they frequently ran out of coffee, juice and eggs through not topping up often enough. There's a funky looking bar and sound system, and a terrace where you can take breakfast.Now for the downside - they 'forgot' to collect my dry cleaning before the 9am deadline (despite my calling down) and as a result I had to chase to get my still dirty clothes returned before checking out the next day. No acceptable apology from housekeeping, although the guy who returned them was clearly embarrassed. My Canadian clients had arranged for a gift to be in our room on arrival, and it wasn't delivered to the room until 11.30pm at night. Having just got off a UK flight, it wasn't fun to be woken up by unsolicted room service! Finally - and importantly - they have no alcohol license! No-one in the hotel mentions it, either when booking or when you're there, but there's only a soft drink mini bar and no way of purchasing wine, beer, anything. My Canadian clients informed me that the owners couldn't get a license, and that it was a bit of a standing joke accross the city that this cooler than cool hotel was dry!All in it's a nice hotel, but service isn't quite right yet and they should really be telling people about the bar absence. You've been warned.....!"
105,1463,"May 26 2006 	Very dark and gloomy	I was bumped to the Hotel Godin for a conference I was attending at the Congress Center. It is not really close to the Palais de Congrais/Congress Center. I think you need to be a person who likes this type of hotel to enjoy it. Good points: The beds are VERY comfortable thought. The staff is nice as well.Bad points: The walls in the bedroom are dark grey to light black. Everything in the hotel is various shades of grey. I found it depressing and hard to see in the room at night. No coffee maker, no iron, no lobby store if you forget something. I dont think Id stay there again as it was to dark for my liking."
106,1463,"May 21 2006	Charming classy	It's not often we find boutique hotels that are cool without being cold, but Hotel Godin is it. We stayed in the basic room with kng size bed, which was spacious, airy, superbly designed, and wonderfuly comfortable. The included continental breakfast was great, and the espresso machine in the lobby with complimentary pound cake was a welcome sight after a long trip The staff were all utterly gracious, competent, and helpful. Add to this the perfect location, and we'll definitely be back over and over and over again."
107,1463,"Apr 29 2006	Nice Hotel	Clean very modern room. Very nice and recommended. Not a big business hotel, small with character."
108,1463,"Mar 27 2006	Fabulous.	I simply loved this hotel. It was chic, simple, stylish and perfect for a weekend getaway with the girls. I came with my best friend the other weekend and adored the room, the service (the concierge is the best thing that ever happened to us!) and the overall ambience. We partied all night at the Globe Restaurant down the street and had a great time. The next morning, the breakfast was the perfect hangover cure. It was the best I've seen at a hotel so far.For two girls who work in fashion publishing from New York, this hotel was a perfect answer for a few fabulous nights of partying in Montreal. I would think it to be Montreal's SoHo Grand or maybe the Mercer...its in a really trendy area that seemed to be close to everything that was worth seeing."
109,1463,"Mar 1 2006 	Elegant Boutique Hotel!	Our room was exceedingly stylish. Attention to details such as creative lighting, a very comfortable bed, dark warm colours for winter mixed with large mirrors and windows for light, all contributed a very balanced and comfortable -not to mention aesthetically pleasing- interior. We wish the bathroom had a bathtub and not just a (albeit beautiful) shower: it's cold in Montreal and we would have liked to immerse ourselves to thaw. We got a good deal on the hotel room online and so price versus quality was really quite astounding at the Godin: that is one reason we rate this hotel excellent and not simply above average. The service at the hotel was discreet (in a European invisible hand way) and very helpful when we asked for advice on Montreal life and where to go out. The location is excellent. We especially enjoyed two nearby restaurants: Au Pied de Cochon and L'Express. It's worth mentioning that the Godin feels a little unfinished -partly because their bar has not yet opened: it is a beautiful space. I hope it's open next time we're in Montreal -we'll be staying at the Godin."
110,1463,"Feb 21 2006	Great boutique hotel though not perfect	Wanted to stay at a boutique hotel in Montreal with my significant other - lots of choice of course, but wanted good value as well. Found Hotel Godin at $140/night for Friday and Saturday night which seemed like a steal and read great things about the history and design of the hotel and rooms.The positives:- Good amenities in the room: nice bathrobes, modern flat screen TV (24&quot;)- Decor was very modern / trendy with deep colors, but still comfortable- Privilege (standard) room was large enough and comfortableThe negatives:- Service was hit-or-miss. Half the time there was no bellman at the door and we had to wait / look for him. Also the staff did not respond to a request for additional towels and glasses, claiming that &quot;the hotel was quite busy&quot;. All in all, staff could have been friendlier, but service was not terrible- Lighting in the rooms is not great, as others have mentionedOverall, we were quite happy with the stay. It is a hotel with quite a lot of style. In fact, I would say that the rooms have a similar style to those at a W Hotel."
111,1463,"Nov 30 2005	Country Gal Loses Her Heart to Montreal	As a first-time tourist to Montreal, all I can say is thank you to Hotel Godin for making my stay so absolutely fabulous. When I had first thought about vacationing in Montreal, I was planning on staying at one of the bigger hotel chains, such as the Holiday Inn or the Sheraton. But then I saw an advertisement of Hotel Godin in a magazine, and decided to go for a more intimate experience. I am so happy I did so! The rooms are stylish, the location to restaurants and nightlife is phenomenal... But the most impressive part of my experience was the staff. After speaking with the concierge and the front-desk staff, I abandoned my pre-arranged schedule of must-see tourist sites, and listened to their suggestions instead. They were able to tell me about events and places to visit that I never would have found on my own. Friendly, knowledgeable and generous, everyone at Hotel Godin went above and beyond in providing me with the best service. I will definitely come back to Montreal in the future, and the only hotel I would ever consider staying at is the Hotel Godin."
112,1463,"Nov 21 2005	Has potential	This hotel is very beautiful and has a lot of potential, but........ The doorman &quot;forgot&quot; to bring our luggage to our room after we checked in, whenever we wanted a tea or coffee from the lounge there were no clean mugs or water (and there were certainly no nibblies either), our internet connection and the pay movie channels were not set up for us leading to 30 minute wait, lightbulbs were burnt out in one of the lamps, the mini-bar was broken and wouldn't open, no wine glasses, corkscrew, iron, or ironing board in room, hard time getting a hold of reception or valet service, and a few times the doorman just stood near the door looking at us (without opening the door)as we were entering the hotel leading to an awkward entrance LOL. It got to the point where we were never surpised when something went wrong. Seems like they took staff from their restaurants to run the hotel.That said, the room and bathroom, although dark, were very clean and nice, the breakfast was great, we loved the &quot;Fresh&quot; toilletries, the location is excellent, and the gym is nice touch. I realize that the things I am complaining about are very menial (I'm by no means a princess), but you expect a certain amount of service and attention to detail when you are staying at a hotel such as this. I would not stay there again only because I have stayed at what is considered their competition (many of them) and had better service.........and I could see myself in their bathroom mirrors!)."
113,1463,Nov 4 2005	beautiful hotel	this is an excellent hotel. striking design. comfotable rooms. central to both the Latin Quarter and Downtown.they do not have a liquor license yet which they are up front about. some articles have errounesoubly mentioned the drinks they serve.
114,1463,"Nov 4 2005	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed at Hotel Godin for four nights. We had searched on Trip Advisor before booking and were pleased that we chose this hotel.Our first impressions were very good - friendly receptionist - helpful porter - great location.Our room was very spacious, comfortable and clean and the bathroom was amazing with a large walk in shower and plenty of fluffy towels. We had one disappointment when after two peaceful evenings the neighbouring room was occupied by a couple of very noisy women - waking us up in the early hours on their return from clubbing! We did complain to reception and they moved us to another room.Breakfast was excellent with a varied choice of cereal, fruit, bread, pastries, tea, coffee and fruit juice. An endless supply of bottled water was available and if you are able to return to the hotel late afternoon, small nibbles are supplied with tea and coffee in the reception.We found the staff to be polite and helpful and would stay here on a return trip to the City. It is in an excellent location for exploring the city and the old town is only a short walk away."
115,1463,"Oct 10 2005	Fun if you're not looking for hominess!	We stayed for a night and knew we were expecting contemporary. It's pretty stark and dark in the rooms but comfortable. The bathroom was very cool with purple glass tiles and black shower. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was yummy with french pastry, fruit and cheese. The only thing I wasn't keen on was how dark things were. The lighting to the lower level bathrooms was so dark you had to run your hand on the walls so you knew where you were going. Otherwise the visit was fun."
116,1463,"Sep 27 2005	The right hotel in the right location	Three friends and I stayed at Hotel Godin for three nights. I would echo the broad theme laid out by all the other reviewers: superb location, attentive/professional service, great rooms, no restaurant/bar yet, stylish, access to trendy bar/lounge/restaurant clubs. Location: the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent turns out to be really a very central location. It is 1 - 15 minutes away from the Latin Quarter, the Village, Chinatown. While we walked to the Old Port area -- most people will probably want to take the Metro or taxi. However, the Old Port area was incredibly touristy -- the equivalent of Times Square in New York City. Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was the equivalent of Tribeca/Soho in New York City. Lots of interesting restaurants, micro-breweries, lounges, clubs and bars -- mostly attended by locals of various ages and interests. We were 5 minutes walk to Schwartz Deli -- which is Montreal's very effective response to New York's Katz's Deli. Hotel service: The four of us came from all over the U.S. at various time. The hotel staff was very careful to remember our preferences, arrival times and helped us coordinate. After we had already &quot;used&quot; our rooms (towels, etc.), we had decided to get two adjoining rooms -- the hotel staff looked into it and immediately accomodated us. While I usually find it extremely creepy staying at hotels where the staff is better looking and better dressed/groomed than the guests, Hotel Godin was the rare exception where everyone was really friendly. Great rooms: Stylish rooms with great bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable. LCD tv. Endless flow of free bottled water. Only complaint I would have was the rooms were a little dark and there was no bath tub. As others have mentioned, there was extremely nice space for a bar and restaurant, but they were not opened. I really hope they get to open them soon.Access to restaurants: Montreal has a few restaurants that turn into dance clubs as the night progresses -- a very neat and fun concept. As we were going to various bars, the bartenders mentioned a couple of places to us: Gogo Lounge (not a strip club!), Myst, Cafe Buona Notte, Globe, Time Supper Club. We went to three of these. It turned out Buona Notte, Globe and Time Supper Club were all owned by Godin. There were huge lines of very beautiful people everywhere, but to my huge surprise (being a cynical New Yorker) the doormen escorted us in at the very front right away at every place when we mentioned we were from Godin.Overall, great experience at Godin (and Montreal). We got a phenomenal price through Expedia ($165/night) but I would be willing to pay a lot more when I come back to Montreal again during Jazz fest. I only hope we can get a room then."
117,1463,"Sep 22 2005	Great location hip rooms 	A fun hotel with friendly staff in a hip area. It would be nice if there was a bar - but the extensive complimentary breakfast made up for it! The gym is small, but really all you need for vacation."
118,1463,Sep 20 2005	Very beautiful!	Wonderful hotel with modern decoration. A bit expensive but worth it.
119,1463,"Sep 18 2005	Wonderful hotel in the best location in Montreal!	I've never written one of these reviews before, but after my stay at the Hotel Godin, I felt compelled to. My husband and I just spent two nights there. We usually stay in the Loews Vogue, and have stayed in the Residence Inn downtown. The location of this hotel and the quality of service both make it better than the others. Hotel: At the Vogue, I've encountered plenty of snobbiness (maybe because my husband and I are young; I don't know). At the Hotel Godin, everyone was incredibly friendly from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out. The Privilege King is a great room; ask for a room with a tub--it's very deep and plenty of room for two. The King bed is so comfortable; the pillows are incredibly soft. There is not a lot of counter space in the bathroom (none really--you have to improvise with the little stand next to the sink). The toilet is in a separate small room from the Shower and tub, which is a good idea. Even though I think the hotel was fairly crowded, it felt like we were the only ones in the entire hotel. It was quiet (except I could hear very late-night revelers outside my 4th floor window, but I didn't care). My laptop didn't pick up a wireless signal, but we purchased it through the TV for 9.95 for 24 hours. Neither the bar nor the restaurant is currently open (as of 9/18). The free breakfast is nice--fruits, cereals, breads, assorted cheeses, croissants, etc. Parking is 24 (CAD). Location: half a block from Rue St. Laurent, with plenty of non-tourist trap restaurants (unlike those restaurants surrounding the area of Loews and the Residence Inn). Maestro SVP was a great seafood bistro; we also ate at Pizzedelic. You hear French a lot more in this area of Montreal, but everyone we encountered spoke English as well. I just arrived home, and I'm already looking into staying there in November. My husband and I had a fantastic time there. I've never encountered a nicer staff. Not even a hint of snobbery. Tip: book thru expedia, as it seems they have the best rates (a lot cheaper than my quotes from orbitz or the hotel). You will not regret staying here!"
120,1463,"Sep 17 2005	Great Location - keep reading	Lets get this straight  Overall, the hotel is lovely and modern - like a photo spread from Wallpaper. (If you dont know what Wallpaper is, you probably will not appreciate the dcor and should take particular note of the following paragraphs).The moment I walked in to the hotel, I appreciated what the owners were trying to do and I was very comfortable. However, the hotel holds itself out as being in a very select league and when you play in the big leagues.well, you know.From reading the hotel website, I had a certain picture in my mind  that expectation was not met. I was hoping for a boutique modern Schrager-esque hotel run like a Swiss watch  that did not happen.The Hotel Godin in a brief description: A modern Schrager-esque hotel run like my grandpas railroad watchWhile the spits and putters of the hotel (and my mixed metaphors) did not destroy the experience - I would say that this wine is being served before its time and the hotel needs to breathe a little before I come back.A few issues:Under-staffedUnder-soundproofed for street noiseNo bar. No liquor license.No restaurant.Don't let the website fool you - just Google &quot;liquor license and Hotel Godin&quot; and you will see that after putting $30 million in renovations, the owners of the hotel have not been permitted to obtain a liquor license - because their other properties have a history of liquor-law violations.So while you can go to the W and lounge and party in the lobby bar and eat in the hotel's restaurant - at the Godin you are stuck with empty space.For some people that would be fine - they like peace and quiet....But please note where this Hotel is located. The corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent is ground-zero for nightlife (think Rush and Division in Chicago) and if you did not know that before you stayed in the hotel - you will know the first night when the horn honking and drunken revelry sings through your windows.The positive side of location, location, location is that you can walk to an assortment of cafes, coffee houses, restaurants, bars and wander back home to the Hotel Godin with no fear of getting lost - you are truly in the middle of the action.The downside of the lively street life is that when the lights go out and before the Xanax kicks in, if you close your eyes really hard, it still sounds like you have camped-out in the hotels backyard (or you left the windows open).I am not sure if I slept for more than one uninterrupted hour at a time due to the noise.The next problem.. strike that: the next issue....the staff. Let me clarify: The staff is wonderful!! Nice, suave, polite, etc... The problem is the &quot;understaff&quot; - you see because the hotel is not fully up-and-running - the hotel is severely understaffed.As frequent Montreal travelers know - there is a flat fee from the airport for transport to the city. About $30 for a taxi and $50 for a limo (Town Car). The limo driver got lost because for some reason no taxi driver or limo driver knows about the hotel - the point is: We were dropped off on the side of the hotel and stood outside for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help us with the bags - there was no one &quot;on duty&quot;. We schlepped all of the bags inside to reception and had to lug our bags to our room. The nice reception lady (girl) was about 5' tall and weighed 100 lbs wet  Do you think I was going to ask her to carry the bags?? Even if she had offered - which she didn't - I was not going to play the colonial governor, so I lugged all of the bags myself.Later in the stay, doormen sporadically appeared, a wonderful concierge appeared and overall the experience was wonderful....Wonderful but &quot;one-off&quot; - and until they get their act completely together I am going back to the W. With all that aside however, the hotel is really ABOVE-average, but it is not excellent.... and I am afraid that with this price-point only the excellent survive."

1,1465,Oct 27 2009 	Very nice stay	This hotel is a 2-3 minute walk from the Place des Arts station. Downtown is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute metro ride. Old Montreal/Chinatown is also a 15 minute walk away. I arrived at this hotel around 12:30 PM and was promptly given a room on the top floor. Staff were always friendly and helpful with any questions I had. No free breakfast but lots of places to eat around hotel including a Cora's across the street. Also a Provigo is across the street so very convenient however there was no fridge or microwave in my room. No free pc to use but there is free wireless internet access. The charge for the pc was I think $3 for 20 minutes. You can go across the street to the 24 hour internet cafe which charged $4 for 1 hour. One thing to be aware of is a new building is supposed to go up next door but construction hadn't started yet when I stayed there.
2,1465,"Oct 12 2009 	Good value great location	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and had a great stay overall. The hotel is in a great location downtown Montreal, close to several great restaurants, shopping, bars, and parks. Even though we were right downtown, we found the hotel nice and quiet. The staff were very nice and helpful directing us around the city. The rooms are nothing special but have everything you need if you are mainly just going to be using your room for sleeping and as a base point."
3,1465,"Aug 12 2009 	Great hotel excellent location	We have now stayed at this hotel 3 times over the past 3 years and we find it very convenient in location to both downtown and McGill university. We have always had clean rooms and courteous staff. The air conditioning always worked, we always had internet accessible and it met all of our expectations. We found it easy to walk downtown or take the subway which is only a block away. The university is easily accessed. The restaurant leaves something to be desired, but just a 10 minute walk leads you to some of the best restaurants in Montreal."
4,1465,"Jul 25 2009 	Nice place to stay	We were there five nights, Saturday through Wednesday. The room had a refrigerator, adequate clothes storage, a sofa, and free wireless Internet service. The staff was quite helpful and courteous, and did everything they could to help us; we needed their assistance numerous times.Our room was clean, comfortable, and always well-made-up every day. We had a corner room, with an extra hallway, which ensured it was quiet, even when the hallway was noisy (there was a boisterous group of athletes in the hotel the first couple of nights).We especially liked the location, with a drugstore and grocery store, as well as several other useful businesses across the street, a two-block walk to the Metro, and a major bus line. It's a short walk to Rue Sherbrooke, Rue St.-Laurent, Rue St.-Denis, and Rue Ste.-Catherine.The only dislikes were relatively minor for us: the room keys usually didn't work on the first try; the television didn't show closed captioning; and the wireless internet was slow when a number of guests were using it.If we ever return to Montreal, we will strongly consider coming back to the Downtown Quality Hotel."
5,1465,"Jul 20 2009 	No attention to detail No Parking Bums sit outside and beg	Just returned from a visit to Montreal and (unfortunately) stayed at this hotel. We had stayed here a few years ago because I had &quot;free&quot; nights, but was unhappy then due to the hard beds and lack of parking (despite the advertising!)...anyway, decided to give them another chance due to the &quot;Sweet Deals&quot; promotion by Montreal-Tourisme - stay 2 nights, get the third free, continental breakfast, and other gifts and promotions for the Laugh Festival, held nearby. Once again, there was no on-site parking available - had to park down the street at a non-secure outdoor lot where the local bums congregated at night. Was informed that there was NO continental breakfast offered - later corrected and given vouchers for a continental breakfast at Cora's(choice of a bagel, cold cereal, or oatmeal) , across the street; however no gifts or promotions for booking as promised (and no effort to rectify after showing the ad to a manager!); a pair of panties left hanging on the bathroom door from a previous guest; dirty bed linens, and an air conditioner that didn't work (but was fixed). The small room refrigerator needed to be defrosted, but worked OK for the items purchased at the Provigo supermarket located across the street (where they charge you 5 cents per bag!) Late night returning would find one or two of the local bums sitting on the bench outside the hotel, (as well as throughout the general neighborhood) asking for handouts! The general location is OK for tourists, near a Metro station, and you can walk (a long walk!) to the Old Port and to the nightime activities on Crescent St. However, for the price charged ($191CAD) for the king-suite (a rather small room) there are other, superior choices in Montreal, with this hotel to be bypased by me in the future, no matter how many &quot;free&quot; nights I can get!"
6,1465,"Apr 13 2009 	Surprisingly Pleasant	Four of us were in Montreal for one night. We needed two rooms, each with two beds as we wanted the comfort and privacy of not sharing beds. The hotel had to be close to McGill and we were on a budget. This hotel met all our needs. I was unsure of what to expect because it is a smaller hotel. It was wonderful. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, comfortable and elegant. It was like staying at larger, luxury hotels, except the rooms were a bit smaller, though still a good size. The hotel was well maintained, the beds were comfortable, the furnishing and linen fresh. No run down feel here. We'll book here next time in Montreal whether we're on a budget or not."
7,1465,"Feb 12 2009	Nice hotel	It is a very nice hotel in a great location. We were with a group and all rooms were nice and updated. One room the t/v didn't work and we phoned down and they said it would be fixed, but it never was. It didn't matter much because we were only there for 1 night. Overall great hotel in nice area."
8,1465,"Oct 23 2008 	Great deal great location	I was skeptical about this hotel before arriving from some of the bad online reviews - but even the much more expensive hotels in the city also have some bad reviews!The room (1 queen, pull out small sofabed) was a little small, but not cramped. Bed was hard, and pillows marshmallowy, but not bad.TV was very small in a cabinet that also was the clothes chest and &quot;closet&quot;. The door concealing the TV would swing closed when you walked by it - minor annoyance.The bathroom was clean and modern with decent water pressure in the shower.Elevators were always fast and desk clerks pleasant.Great location - half a block from Sherbrooke Ave where all the higher priced hotels are. 2 blocks from the Metro entrance. Half a block from a 24 hour Second Cup coffee shop. 4 blocks from McGill.$15 a night for secure parking is a good deal - most hotels are charging $25 and many of the stand-alone lots are not secure."
9,1465,"Oct 17 2008 	Great hotel convenient access to the rest of Montreal	Let me start by saying my wife and I had three free nights coming to me, so the rooms were free - I only had to pay for parking. While the hotel parking was $15/night, I saw other parking lots throughout the city charging the same 24-hour rate, so I wasn't too disappointed. I've stayed in other cities of this size or larger that charge much more per night.I really can't say anything bad about the hotel. The lobby wasn't huge or glamorous, but I'm not spending any time there. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and at my request even provided me with some hints about what to see, where to go and even a few key French phrases. Everything was very clean as well.The room was simple but clean and met our needs. The pillows could have been a little more firm. The heat worked fine when needed. The TV was fine. Ice machine on our floor.The big perk this hotel offers is convenient access to the Metro (5-minute walk) and numerous eateries and convenient stores in the area. I found the grocery store across the street convenient but a bit expensive. I found another grocery store on St. Laurent (10-minute walk) that was less expensive. I'd have no problems recommending this hotel or staying here again."
10,1465,"Sep 25 2008	Not Bad Not Great	I stayed at the Quality Hotel September 20-22.The best part about this hotel is the location; you're right in the heart of downtown Montreal, only a few blocks' walk from a variety of shops, restaurants, bars and night clubs.The downsides? Some of the rooms are very outdated (friends of ours had better luck in other rooms). For example, our room had a very old TV that had the alarm clock built-in! The mini-bar is $10 per day, and our fridge was really old. The bedding also left a little to be desired - very firm mattress, average sheets/pillows, and a comforter that had the color and texture of a burlap sack.The front desk attendants also warned us to watch our luggage, bags, etc. everywhere we went in the hotel outside of our room. They said that unattended bags are always getting stolen, especially from the lobby. However, I'm sure this isn't unique to this particular hotel; it probably happens anywhere in downtown hotels.All in all, if you're looking for a decently-priced hotel with basic amenities but access to all that downtown Montreal has to offer, this is the hotel for you. If you want a hotel experience that's anything above ordinary, I suggest you look elsewhere."
11,1465,"Sep 2 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	We were pleasantly surprised. Great location, clean room, except for funky smell when we first came in, but I believe it was attributed to the maid just cleaning our room before we got there and cleaning tools may have been the culprit becasue the smell eventually dissapeared (like wet mop or used wet towel smell).It was just confined to the bathroom, and like i said, went away after a while, so we didn't complain. If you're simple people, or have a family, this is the place to be. I'll summarize and keep it short with my pro's and cons below:Pros: 1) location, location, location! short walk to subway, st. catherine street, st. laurent st, mont royal parc, old montreal, etc - perfect location! (across the street from a supermarket and tons of restaurants nearby) and close to subway too!2) friendly and informative staff 3) Parking, high $15 fee, but worth it with the in and out privelages 4) Clean and overall inviting feeling of hotel.Cons: 1) parking lot got full, and if you left, you might not get your spot back. But we left the car parked anyway, so it didn't bother us. 2) Funky &quot;wet smell&quot; in bathroom that eventually went away. Overall, a great value and cool place if you're looking to save doe on hotels, and use that saved doe for the night clubs or retaurants!"
12,1465,"Aug 8 2008 	Decent hotel bad experience	We stayed at the hotel one weekend in July. It's in a good location, walking distance from Vieux Montreal and Rue Sainte-Catherine. The room size was good and clean.Unfortunately, they decided to paint our floor without telling us beforehand. We get off the elevator on our floor, to find a worker spray painting the hall. He freaked out and shoved us off the floor. We couldn't get into our room, and had inhaled toxic fumes!The front lobby told us that they left a message at our room, about changing rooms. We checked - it was left close to 11:30 am the same day! The hotel staff had to get all of our stuff. It was not a good scene.We had to wait until the general manager was in Monday - we were going to be credited for one night's stay. But it took me several emails and phone calls over 2 weeks to finally get my credit card deducted.It's too bad because the hotel was fine otherwise. But the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
13,1465,"Jun 11 2008 	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in	We staying at this hotel during Grand Prix weekend 3 adults and 1 infant. For over $1500 for 3 nights we were incredibly disappointed. The only thing that was good about this place is that they let us check in at 11 am because of the baby. After that it was all downhill. We were told the hotel had Wi-Fi access, and it did not, when we went to get a cable it did not work. We called down to the front desk and they informed us that the 8th floor did not have internet!On the second day (Saturday) we left the hotel at 9 am to head to the race track. When we arrived back at the hotel at 3 pm we found our door left open! On top of that our room was not made. Nor did any one come to make it. We called down to make a complaint and they told us that someone would be up to check our door lock. They told us that the results were inconclusive and that it must have been us who left the door open. Sunday We left at 9am again I arrived back at 2:30 with the baby, again the room was not made. When the maid came by I was feeding the baby on the couch and all she did was put a dirty towel back up on the rack. Throw some towels in the washroom and change a garbage, plus she left the door open again! Which I did not notice until my brother came back because I was on the couch the whole time and could not see the door! When my brother called to the front desk they said there was nothing they could do and that he would have to wait to see the manager the next morning. Every time we asked for something they told us they didn't have it. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and the food was absolutely horrific. However our waitress was very very kind and gave great service. We want a refund for our stay because they have a 100% Satisfaction guarantee that if there is a problem that is not solved they will issue a refund. When we mentioned this, they said nothing. Overall it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had I will never be back to this hotel!"
14,1465,"May 19 2008 	Okay experience; receptionist unfriendly	Stayed at the hotel for a few days, it is a good location, pretty close to Downtown Montreal. The rooms are okay but smaller than other hotels. Room was well furnished, exterior of the building was okay as well. Garage was a bit dirty.Upon checkout, the receptionist was not very friendly, and probably dealt with us differently than she should have because -we were non-French. When we left, she muttered something in French that was possibly an insult. I would not want to visit this hotel again if it is the same receptionist. When we first walked in, our first impression of the hotel was that it was very small, and it actually is. there's hardly a concierge area, and hardly even a lounge. A restaurant shares the first floor with the hotel, and there are no amenities.Overall I would say it was an average stay for us at this hotel, wasn't that great but okay for us to live in the hotel."
15,1465,Mar 13 2008 	Hotel Stay	We were two adults and two teenagers that arrived at the Hotel on a sunday and planned to stay till tuesday but changed our mind after one night. Ask for the connection to internet and was told that they didn't have any left. Television picture was very snowy and every time you shut it off....it had to be unblocked by the front staff. We ask questions about the area and the clerk couldn't answer us. Parking at 15.00 a night is a bit expensive. The restaurant attached to the hotel is great and the service was exceptional with good food.
16,1465,"Feb 12 2008	Great place!	I visited this place as a solo traveller as I got a great rate from Expedia. For its location and price, you can't go wrong. The room was comfortable and very clean, although the room could have been a little warmer, given it was the depth of winter.Lovely, friendly staff and a supermarket across the street, made this an enjoyable stay."
17,1465,"Jan 23 2008 	great experience would do it all over again	We are from Victoria BC and visited Montreal for the first time in January 2008, my son, myself and 2 friends. We were there for the habs game and everything was perfect. Front counter staff was very helpful and everything you need is very close to the hotel. Being first time visitors to Montreal, we were glad we could experience the night life without taxing all over the place. Beautiful view of the city line aswell. Also very close to Bell Centre. Paid corporated rate so it wasn't too expensive, two double beds and a couch. Would we go again, YES and stay at the same place. Thanks for a great time. go habs go!!!"
18,1465,"Oct 17 2007 	Perfectly Acceptable!!	I got a very good rate on Hotwire for a five night stay over the long Coumbus Day/Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is located on a decent street near McGill. Walking distance to most everything and very close to a Metro for everything else. Very nice supermarket right across the street. You really cannot beat the convenience or the price for a basic, clean hotel experience.Room was clean and well maintained. Nicely organized, although no closet at all. Free ethernet Internet service. My only issues were with lack of follow-up at the Front Desk when my lost luggage arrived and a lack of organization or logic with housekeeping that kept my room from being made up for my first three days at the hotel. The latter was somewhat caused by my schedule but the housekeeper did not follow up and clean my room when I was actually away from the hotel as I had asked. It was this general lack of communication among hotel staff members that caused the only disappointments during my stay."
19,1465,"Oct 10 2007 	Standard Safe Clean and Good Location	This is an average standard chains hotel, very clean, safe and located in down town. The ladies in the receptionist desk were polite and helpfull. Nothing to brag about this one, a bit pricey for what it is...."
20,1465,"Sep 29 2007 	Nice hotel	The room was clean, the bed was good, the tv was 29&quot; flat, well located, staff sometimes gently but sometimes not. There is a subway station near and a market in front of the hotel. We stood there for 4 days. we had a little problem with the door lock - it didn't open but it was solved quickly."
21,1465,"Sep 4 2007 	Pricey for its class	This hotel is located on the outskirts of hotel row off sherbrooke boulevardPROS: Location is across street from supermarket  walking to Old Montreal is about 20 minutes  Metro stop is about 5 min. walk  good continental breakfast if your package includes  parking in facilities(extra cost)  4 pillows per bed was helpfulCONS: Very pricey for quality of hotel  beds were uncomfortable  furniture is from the 1980s  room had musky odor (when told of problem, the fix was to spray the room with a scent)  Carpets were worn and quite dirty  AC didn't work so well  only 2 people operated front desk when we were there (we were a bit concerned since upon arrival, two homeless persons were sitting in front of the hotel staring at us)"
22,1465,Jul 5 2007 	Good location - high price	I inquired about the price and the man at the front desk quoted me a price. I asked if there was parking. He said 'no' but recommended a lot. I left to check the parking. When I came back the price had gone up. The hotel was OK otherwise. The location is good.Park on the street if you have a car. The parking instructions are in french. Have somebody translate what the parking rules are. Everybody speaks english.
23,1465,"Jun 9 2007 	Fantastic Value in the heart of the action!	Boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel on our way through to Atlantic Canada. Clean, comfortable rooms at a great price. Wonderful location in the heart of downtown Montreal."
24,1465,"Apr 24 2007	Great hotel	We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. We were somewhat uncertain, having read the other reviews on the site. We arrived early and were immediately shown to our room. The people at the desk could not have been friendlier or more helpful throughout our stay. The room was clean and, along with the bathroom was a nice size. The location is ideal; there is a 24/7 restaurant in the lobby, a grocery store across the street, a small mall up the street, it is near the downtown shopping, and there is a lovely pedestrian area filled with restaurants (avenue Prince Arthur) in a short walking distance. We would definitely stay here again."
25,1465,"Apr 15 2007 	Great Location! Great Staff!	I felt that this hotel was wonderful!As two couples of 24 year olds, all first timers to Montreal, we we're not too sure what to expect. After fist finding our way to another Quality Inn and being scared for our lives by the outside view, we were happy to realize that we were at the wrong Quality. After finding our way to the hotel, everything from there on was perfect. As Choice Privilege members, we did inquire about our complimentary upgrade. They had upgraded rooms available but we would not be able to have close rooms. An employee escorted us to view the rooms to decide if we wanted to upgrade and be apart, or keep the original rooms and be connecting. The upgrade rooms were a tiny bit larger, but did not offer much else except a mini fridge, so we chose to stay in our lower grade rooms. The hotel is RIGHT across the street from a grocery store that is open late, where you can purchase some alcohol, snacks, breakfast foods, etc, if you want to save on some money. We did dine in the adjoining restaurant in the hotel. The food was good, but the waitress appeared fairly absent minded.. forgetting plenty of our requests. Our room also had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the street which was nice to watch the hustle and bustle (and people watch the shoppers in the grocery store).The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main streets for shopping, and there are a multitude of restaurants once you step outside.There is a daily fee for secured parking in the underground parking lot.The front desk staff were very helpful, from the moment we inquired about viewing both room types before deciding whether to upgrade, right up until we checked out.One of the girls at the front desk (I really wish I could remember her name) was great. As we didn't know much about Montreal, we wanted to experience a bit of the nightlife but weren't sure were to head. She let us know what clubs would be busy on what evenings, and even called a friend of hers that was dj'ing at one of the clubs to get us placed on the guestlist and some complimentary drinks.On our last evening, after a heavy night of drinking we did not end up checking out to nearly 1:30 p.m, and no one called our room to kick us out! :)Unfortunately, I cannot say if the price was worth our stay as we had a Quality Inn Employee discount (which means we had a very cheap rate), but I am pretty confident that it would be worth the full price (even if the hotel was terrible, I would pay it for the location only!)The next time I return to Montreal, I will definitely be staying at this hotel!"
26,1465,Jan 3 2007	terrible experience don't go there	I had a terrible experience there. These people promise you one thing but do something else. They simply lie. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place.
27,1465,"Oct 23 2006 	Good price Great Location	We booked the Quality Hotel Downtown for a girls trip to Montreal. The price was extremely frugal ($45 USD on Priceline.com). Although with the parking ($15/day) and the charge of $10/day for a non-smoking room, drove the costs up a bit. Priceline had originally booked us into a smoking queen room but we needed two doubles non-smoking. I had called ahead to the hotel twice to request that but was told that I would have to take my chances at check-in. Luckily, we did get the room we wanted.We loved the hotel for it's convenient location...it's within walking distance to St. Catherine and only one block away from St. Laurent.The rooms were clean and the beds were hard and comfortable. Pillows were a bit lacking so if you're picky about those, I suggest bringing your own.It's nothing fancy but it was perfect for us."
28,1465,"Aug 22 2006 	Excellent value for money!	We didn't have any idea what to expect with this hotel &amp; we were pleasantly surprised. We had a 2 night stay &amp; found this hotel to be awesome. Great location, very friendly front desk staff. Rooms clean &amp; good size. Supermarket across the road. Metro station 2 blocks away. Very happy to stay here again."
29,1465,"Jul 3 2006	OK hotel	We stayed two nights - Sunday &amp; Monday - as part of a touring holiday.Checkin was a little slow as we had a trainee, but very polite and clear. We parked the car in the car park (under the hotel) and left it until we checked out.The room was OK - outlook onto the graffitti on the next building. Reasonably clean.We found the location a little off-putting - not the beggars that another reviewer commented on - they seem to be in any big city, but depending on which way we went the area changed drastically. Going east seemed a shabby, run-down area with &quot;adult&quot; shops &amp; entertainment. West was definitely up-market.We walked south to the old-town area - under 15 minutes and also had a similar walk back from Mont Royal.We ate the second morning in Werby's the lobby restauarant where the staff were deluged by a school party &amp; still coped quickly &amp; in a friendly manner, apologising for the delay, which we had barely noticed.Overall we would say the hotel was OK for the money, but we wouldn't enthuse."
30,1465,"Oct 12 2005	Great Experience!!!	I stayed at the QH Downtown from October 7-11, 2005. To be honest, I really expected the worst based on some of the reviews below. However, I was absolutely surprised and pleased with my stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future.1) The hotel is located one block away from Sherbrooke, one of the main streets in Downtown Montreal. It's also a 10 minute walk from St. Laurent (&quot;The Main&quot;), one of the most ultra-hip and exciting streets in the city. It sits on the edge of downtown but is closer to The Plateau, the artistic district of Montreal. (Great inexpensive restaurants and bars in the area, including some restaurants where you can bring your own wine!) It is also less than a 5 minute walk from Jeanne Mance (ever seen photos of the iron staircases in Montreal? Chances are they were taken on Jeanne Mance street.). 2) The hotel is directly across the street from Provigo, a well-stocked and clean grocery store (check out their pastry section!). It was WONDERFUL (and inexpensive) to zip across the street and pick up provisions for the weekend. 3) The only problem I encountered was that the movie channels would not work when I arrived. Rachelle at the front desk went above and beyond to try to get them to work again Friday evening and continued to follow up with me throughout the weekend to get them functional. 4) The restaurant was closed while I was there, but there is a local restaurant (Alto - pick up a menu in the lobby) who will deliver as late as 5:00 a.m.!!! Good food, quick delivery. I highly recommend their pizza. 5) I found the front desk staff to be accommodating, warm, and very helpful. They went above and beyond to ensure I had a good stay. All in all, it was a very good experience. Granted, this isn't a four star hotel, but you get a great value for the price."
31,1465,"Sep 22 2005 	It's not bad	It is fine if you just want a base from which to explore the city. It is nowhere as scary as the &quot;Never Again&quot; post would indicate. I got spooked by that post and ended up booking another hotel for the first three days of my stay. Yes, that other hotel (2.5*) is head and shoulders above the 2* Quality Downtown, but if you happened to get this hotel from Priceline, don't worry and enjoy your stay as long as your aim is to explore the city instead of worrying about the service level of your hotel.The neighborhood is a mix of downtown businesses and student housing. On Sherbrooke, which is only 1/2 a block away, it's all businesses and posh hotels. On Ave du Parc, it's a mixture of convenient stores, restaurants, outdoor cafes, and a supermarket. The hotel is also within walking distance of the Metro and St. Laurent where a lot of Montreal nightlife takes place. The point is if McGill students managed to live through 4 years of their education living in this neighborhood, you'll be OK for a few days."
32,1465,"Aug 24 2005	Quality is Adequate	Me and a few friends just returned from a weekend stint at this hotel. As said before this hotel is a 3 star. You get what you pay for. It provides you with the basics. A Room with A.C., adequate beds, trademark flat hotel pillows, and maid service. It is a great hotel because of its location. Close to Supermarket, Liquor Store, and the club scene and night life is all within walking distance. As said before last year I stayed at the Delta nearby on President Kennedy and that is a cut above but that is a 4 star and well you pay more. It's around $15 or so per day for parking in the garage. We just parked it when we arrived and took it out when we left. Close by to everything. We were on a floor with an ice machine. If you are in need for ice like we were it does the job but if you are looking for a large amount of ice in a short amount of time it may do the job but not real quick. Maid on the last day since we didnt ask for maid service sort of yelled/informed us about how &quot;NOT TO OPEN THE WATER&quot; she was saying not to open the bottle of water in the room that is on the table and just replace it with tap water and how she would know. Found that okay a little weird cause who is going to drink a medium size bottle of water that is $3.50? All in all no real complaints. When we requested more towels we got them. Front Desk when going in and out were friendly. If you plan on staying in the hotel for a while during the day when your not out then the hotel doesnt really have time consuming things. It is simply put ADEQUATE for people that just need a place to stay that will give you a place to sleep (in smoking and non-smoking) and any of the other basics. If you lookin for more its going to cost you more."
33,1465,"Aug 3 2005	Locationlocationlocation	I had a good deal in hotwire,it just us$45/night(tax not included) we booked the hotel for 5 nights,what can ask for this price in the downtown.The room is fine,the front desk is quite helpful.but the most important thing is the location,you can walk to metro for less than 5 min(but I can't imagine in the winter),the bus stop just the corner(check for the time ,30min in non-rush hour)if you want to the old montreal/chinatown, either bus or walk is fine ,it a straight road.Easy to access anywhere like shopping,sightseeing...There's supermarket across the street,very convenient,not only the supermarket,a bakery,couples of resturant,Cara is the place we went twice,try the breakfast, the crepe filled with lot of fruit,dip with nutella,very great.I saw some beggars beg for money along the streets,I experienced a beggar came to me for the money when I walked from the metro to hotel.And one night we saw a man slept at the front door of the hotel,few people looking at him,the staff of hotel came out and ask something ,then she returned to the hotel,it seems this happen before(a woman walking along and said he just faking always)So i advised girls to be watched out when you have to go out at night.One more thing,you have to pay $10/day for the high speed internet,really expensive,and when we called the service desk ask about the service detail,she gave us wrong information,the service should be from noon to noon,but the one one the phone said its from midnight to midnight,so be careful."
34,1465,"Dec 29 2004	Never again!	Firstly I think the reviews below are for the Quality Inn Downtown at 1214 Crescent St and NOT where I stayed which is Quality Hotel Downtown at 3440 av du Parc - even though they are part of the same hotel chain with similar names they are different.The hotel furnishing and fittings were a bit run down and not up to scratch. For example loose strands of thread on the sofa, a dodgy coffee maker, and in the bathroom a section of the wall that had been patched with filla but never painted / papered. There was a perma air freshener smell that hotels have, this one I think was apple blossom, but it was so awful and corrosive that it actually made my throat burn when in small places like the lift.The location was OK but not great, it is a number of blocks to Rue St Catherine, and I suggest you check on maps before booking if you want to be near certain things such as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Vieux (Old) Montreal. I ended up doing a lot of walking around the city just to get to somewhere, which in sub-zero temperatures is not always fun. There was a super market across the road, although I found a smaller but nicer one at the Galeries du Parc a few minutes away. There is also a good 24 hour internet caf across the street.My first morning there I was woken up at 7am by a work crew who were there to totally redecorate the communal parts of my floor. There was no attempt to be quiet. I had shouting, ladders clanging, singing, humming, loud conversations and electric sanding all just outside my door. There was no excuse for this. Their business is being a hotel and at the very least they should have mentioned it to me, but they could have put me on another floor or got the crew to start work at a more sociable hour for guests.When I compare this to what I got in Toronto and Ottawa for the same money there is no way I can consider this a good deal. I was wary about booking into any hotel with Quality in the name, but based on the other reviews (which I now know to be for a different hotel) I thought I would give it a go. Never again will I risk going to this hotel, there are plenty of other good hotels at the same price.PS I enjoyed Montreal, and hope to return soon for another vacation"
35,1465,Jun 3 2004	Good location good price.	My friends and I spent a few nights in this hotel and were pleasantly surprised. I guess we had low expectations but everything turned out great. The parking is in a secure garage and the food in the restaurant downstairs was great. We got a really good deal on the rooms from expedia so we weren't sure what to expect for the price. We were in walking distance to a lot of places and there's a grocery store right across the street. I'd probably stay there again if I ever go back to Montreal again. This is a perfect hotel if you plan on sightseeing Montreal and go places.
36,1465,"Jun 2 2004	bang for the buck it has lots of value	Great location, just 1 block off of the center of St Catherine street. Close to the local subway which I found so easy to navigate. Private Garage asures safe parking. Great resturaunt called Mango's adjacent to the hotel located on the main floor. ( they serve a great breakfast) and keep a well stocked bar. The Front Desk was an excellent help, always happy to make dinner reservations for us and never being off when recamending a place to eat or visit. The rooms were clean &amp; quaint, the bathroom is a bit small but definetly sufficent, the tub was deep enough for me to soak my 6 foot 240 pound frame which is nice after a day off treking around the city. Right accross the street is a full service grocery store(great for the budget concious) or if you just need something you forgot to pack. Considering I paid less then $300 for a 4 night stay I would recamend this hotel and may even stay there again. It would have been nice to have a few more amenities (like a pool) but hey I was there to see the city not lounge around a hotel."
37,1465,"Oct 20 2003	Cresent Street NIGHTLIFE!! NIGHTLIFE!!	The Quality Inn Downtown on Crescent Street 1 block south of St Catherines has been recently refurbished and is clean and safe. No it's not the Ritz but for $65-$90.00 USD depending on the season also consider the fact that within a 6 block radius of the Quality there is some of the best nightlife on this continent...!!!!!!!!!Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, Disco, Jazz, Rock, Irish, sophisticated to grunge, and when the bars close at 3 (If you have been there for a while they close the doors at 3 and let you stay till 4 usually drinking for free by now if you had been taking care of your bartender) now you only have a two short blocks to stumble home to your hotelWhen checking in ask for Jerry (one of the managers) introduce your self to him and he will take excellent care of you!!

1,1466, coffee and tea. It is located next to a snack bar type area. We did try out the free internet on a computer set-up in the lobby
2,1466, when I arrived this afternoon
3,1466, If you go to this place next year in the beginning of May
4,1466, but now all of sudden there was a sudden urgency for us to leave the room. This was also very unprofessional. After a few minutes of arguing the clerk did allow for the late checkout. This is all without mentionning the poor state of the room: - the tub would not drain properly - several towels during the week were dirty with blood stains or yellow stains - the toilet was unstable - the bed was uncomfortable - the air conditionning only worked intermittently - the curtains were dirty and stained	
5,1466, but when we returned to the hotel and my wife rested in the room she got a knock on the door at about 4:00pm by the maid who told her that she would like to clean the room now
6,1466, however also did not expect a slimehole.	
7,1466, we decide to stay the night. They charge us $145 the night and they say they are a 3 stars hotel
1,1468,Aug 23 2009 	Good location period.	Negative: The water leaks from the ceiling when it rains. the walls are thin so you need ear plugs. Positive: Great locatioin. Easy access to metro station. Wide choice of good restaurants around.
2,1468,"Jul 7 2009 	NIce location that's as good as it gets!	The hotel itself was in a great location, very close to all the main attractions in Montreal. It was fairly clean but a lot of the fixtures in the bedroom and bathroom could do with updating. We opted to use the hotel carpark as on street parking can be very expensive, and we assumed that our car would be safe. On our second morning there we were woken by a phone call from reception telling us that the car had been broken into. The entire back window was smashed in and there were dents in the passanger side door. We spoke to the receptionist about this and he didnt care and told us that we should expect it as we were staying in downtown Montreal! Also, we later realised that 2 mins walk from the hotel, there was a secure carpark where we could have parked our car in for an extra $3 a night! The secure carpark also has designated spaces for guests staying at the hotel. We asked the hotel staff why they never told us about the carpark, but they were unable to give us an acceptable reply. Overall, if you need somewhere cheap to stay in the centre of Montreal, then this place is ideal. If you have a car make be sure to use the secure carpark complete with cctv and security guards."
3,1468,"Jul 4 2009 	Smelly	We got here and noted that the halls and the room were rank . The hotel staff wasn't too friendly, but being from New England that did not bother me. The rooms were decent-sized and appeared clean except for that smell. The hotel was definitely not worth the low price we paid. Also, the walls are very thin and there was a very obnoxious group of American college kids there to party- why they decided to party in that place is beyond me. At any rate, it was noisy and smelly, and tough to get a good night's sleep. The location is good, except that it is right next to a strip club. But there are other hotels in the area and I can't imagine they wouldn't be better than this one! The reason we booked at this hotel was the location, and we figured we would not spend much time in the hotel but rather seeing the city. This was true, but I would have preferred a place at least with a neutral odor!"
4,1468,"Jan 12 2009 	DO NOT BOOK HERE!! Horrible experience will never return	The main reason we chose this particular hotel is we wanted to get the most bang for our buck. BIG BIG mistake. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 pm on a Monday and went to check in. Was notified at that time, although guaranteed parking at the hotel, that we would be parking a block away in the public underground parking in the library for 10$ a day.Once we brought all our luggage into our room, which smelled of musky, stale smoke (we had to spray perfume, open a window and turn on a fan in order to get rid of the smell), we went to park our car and walked back to the hotel. As we were walking to our room, the front desk clerk (and owner, which we later found out) rudely informed us that we should respect the other patrons of the hotel and not be loud or we'd be kicked out. We found it extremely disrespectful considering the only reason he said this was because we were three young girls (20-22).We got to our hotel room to find that we only had 2 towels so we went down to ask for one extra as there were three of us, and he reluctantly gave us an extra towel. Every time we would leave the hotel, whether it was early in the morning for sightseeing and shopping, or later at night for dinner and dancing, the front desk would always ask us which room we were staying in, which we found to be a little odd. We didnt think much of it.On our third day at the hotel (new years eve), we arrived at the hotel after sightseeing to the police at the hotel. We later found out that over 1000$ worth of items and money had been stolen from a room on the same floor as us. The hotel does not provide safes and does not use swipe cards for their rooms. We are provided with one key and the extras are all with the hotel staff. The owners denied having any involvement in the robbery, and refused to let the police search the housekeeping or owners vehicles or property for the stolen items... a little fishy in my opinion.The hotel staff, aside from one individual who worked the overnight shifts, are crooked and give horrible customer service. Not once did we feel welcome. We will never be back to this hotel and I hope you will chose another place to stay during your visit as well. Their staff are not trustworthy and completely ruined the one groups (who's property was stolen) new years and trip, along with ours.The fact that they asked what room we were in when we LEFT our rooms, random phone calls/hang ups late morning and early evening to see if we were in our rooms, etc... it all added up. DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL WHEN IN MONTREAL!! It may seem like a good deal at the time, however, I'd STRONGLY advise against it. Whether this incident was a one time occurance, I would hate to see this happen again to another group of travellers."
5,1468,Oct 6 2008 	Not worth the money	Excellent location. Better not to write about the rest
6,1468,"May 19 2008 	An OK hotel	I booked this hotel mainly for the price. We wanted to spend a weekend in Montreal, but without breaking our budged: I believe the price I paid was $76 plus taxes. I have to say  if you value your comfort and you want a big room with a big bathroom, this is NOT the place for you. This hotel must have the smallest rooms I have ever been in, though it was clean. It looks more like a hostel. I personally didnt care so much for the furniture, or TV, or for any of the other little things, as I was there just to sleep, not to spend my day. It is a very modest looking place though!! The breakfast was little but OK, though I could see how this is not enough for a guy. Also, the eating area was pretty poor looking  yet, I would not hold this against it. The pluses: the hotel is located close to many clubs and bars, and for young people this would be an ideal location. I didnt care much for most of those clubs, but the hotel is in walking distance (maybe a 20 min walk) from the more upscale clubs and restaurants. So if you dont want the hassle of finding a parking place in downtown and just ride the subway, returning to the hotel late in the night wont be a problem. Also, I would list the price as a plus. The staff was helpful, and we had no issues.The minuses: because it was close to so many bars, it turned out to be a very noisy location too. I mean, extremely noisy, because I am pretty tolerant myself. The parking could be an issue in the winter. We parked a block away, in the garage at Cegep Du Vieux Montreal which was I believe $15/night. There are cheaper options, but these are not covered parking lots, which may be an issue in the winter. And obviously, if you are all for comfort you will be a bit disappointed about this place. For instance we had to ask for towels because there weren't enough.Overall, this is a good place for young people traveling on a budget. You get what you pay for!"
7,1468,"Mar 6 2008	My Filthy Experiene With Unfriedly Service	This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. When we first arrived the person at the front desk demanded we pay for our 3 nights in advance,which I reluctantly agreed to,(that was a mistake!)When we entered our room there was stains all over the carpet it smelled and there was very poor lighting from 2 small lamps on the attached piece of plywood hanging from the wall. We figured we could endure, after all it was only 3 nights. when we got up the next morning we seen how bad this place really was with natural daylight. We figured that things may get better when they cleaned the room,mistake #2. When we got back from our sightseeing day our hotel room had not been cleaned, so I went down to the front desk to complain And was made to feel that it was my problem. Bear in mind that this was a weekend of the Presidents Cup and the $59 nights were now $129 nights. After the second night I had enough and went down to check out, at this time I was told that the hotel required 48 hours notice but they would be nice and only charge me for 1 night. I made my reservations over the phone and was not informed of any cancellation whatsoever . Overall,this was the worst travel experience I ever had. Did I mention this hotel is right next door to a strip club(sort of sleazy,no? )"
8,1468,"Nov 25 2007 	Perfect !	I stayed 1 night at Hotel Quartier Latin in a 2 double beds room in November. We were 4 University students going to Montreal to attend a Conference. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone, especially young people who like night life, because, we have to say it, the hotel can't be in a better location. You are in the middle of everything, and St-Denis Street is all about hanging out with friends, visiting bars, and boutiques of all kinds. The room was perfect, very clean, a good size, a little small but perfect, TV, the washroom is very clean, no problem there, we also had a cute dormer window. The receptionists are also very very helpful, since we didn't know the city, they gave us a plan and helped us a lot. I have know negative to tell about our stay there. Maybe, one little thing is that we had let the window opened during the night and at 3h30 in the morning, we were waken up by people who left bars. But it didn't last long. Perfect perfect! Moreover, the building has recently been renovated. I recommand this hotel to everbody!!!!!! The fees are also so low!!!!"
9,1468,"Nov 13 2007	Perfect Location Nice Place	I found this hotel through Orbitz, and we liked it alot. It is in an old building so the rooms have that kind of old Europe size and character. Nice and clean, we enjoyed our 2 night stay. The rate was excellent, and we were centrally located to downtown so dining and tourist fun was all within walking distance. Short drive out to Olympic area. The only negative is parking. Parking isn't included and they only have a few spaces. Parking in nearby lots and on the street is manageable but inconvenient. I slept a few minutes late and got a parking ticket. There is a go-go bar nearby but the neighborhood is safe and friendly with nice shops and excellent restaurants."
10,1468,"Nov 12 2007 	We enjoyed our stay	I have visited Montreal three times this year. During our last visit, we stayed here and we found it to be quite reasonable for the price. I dont remember exactly how much we paid for our two rooms, but for the price, what else could you ask for? For young adults, the frills dont seem to be of as much more importance than having a bed to sleep in and a bathroom to use. We stayed for two nights. I dont thnk that the rooms were small at all. We had a window with a &quot;sort-of&quot; ledge i guess that you could sit on and look out on St. Denis. We never ate breakfast here, we always walked accross the street to the cafe. Its a great location, if youre there to have a good time and experience montreals nightlife. Shopping is great, no matter how much you walk. Honestly, i wouldnt want to experience it in any other way. We are planning to visit again in November. We have made reservations to stay here, i hope i dont experience anything like the rest of you have.Also, the other two times i have visited montreal, i stayed at econo and some other SMALLLLLL hotel in old montreal. I would recommend this hotel tremendously over the other two! Much cleaner, better location. I guess its a matter of opinion."
11,1468,"Sep 23 2007 	Horrible Hotel Experience!	My Fiance and I stayed in this hotel for a week in June. The location was perfect, right in the centre of everything. However, on leaving the hotel it was very obvious that my fiance had several items of his clothes missing. I have searched everywhere and the clothes were GONE!! When I contacted the hotel 3 days after checking out, they told me that the room still hadn't been cleaned, and said they would contact me if they found anything... I am still waiting for that return call."
12,1468,"Jul 20 2007 	Not luxury but great location	The room was dark and looked out on the air shaft. This actually was a bonus because we were staying when Montreal was having a street festival. Since we had an interior room, it cut out the noise from the street. The room did have dim lights and and could use some painting, but it was clean, the bathroom was clean and the door was secure. We also were able to pay for off-street parking. It's a good value if you are looking for cost and security and are not concerned with the frills. It also has a great location. Directly on Rue St. Denis, it is near a subway station and has many interesting restaurants within walking distance."
13,1468,"Jan 7 2007 	Moldy Misty Humid And No A/C	No air conditioning, hot humid days were with us in Summer 2006, and rooms were musty, hot and felt wet, moist, &amp; humid. My room door was open when I got there, propped open by a garbage can, presumably to get misty-ness out of the room before guests arrive. Rooms are tiny, beds are tiny - Hotel is right beside a strip joint. Rooms do not accomodate 2 people, bed is too small. Did I mention no AC? Lobby door of hotel is wide open to let air in. Not accessible, steep stairs. Staff aren't professional, it's some guy in early 20s, for about 20$ more I got a room at the Sheraton on Hotwire, and left the room at Quartier Latin, it was garbage it was not worth it."
14,1468,"Aug 30 2006 	Bad Hotel	The only great thing I can say about this hotel is the location. The price they charge for our stay (5 nights) was expensive. The rooms were unclean, the patio had lots of dirty bottles in addition to dirty windows. The towels well worn and our room was relatively small with old and well used dresser and night table. The TV was located above on a ledge whose shelf was very unclean. Our sheets were not changed at all during the entire week we stayed at this hotel. The staff unfriendly. This hotel did not accomodate for disabled with no elevator at all in the building. One had to pack your suitcase (s) to the entrance then to your hotel room. Never bothered with the continental breakfast. Would not recommend this hotel for anyone to stay in. Lastly, they charged my credit card for unknown cost in which I disputed and disallowed payment despite the fact, my hotel room was paid in cash for our 5 night stay."
15,1468,"Jul 19 2006	College Dorms Have More Charm	First, the good news: This hotel is inexpensive and in a very good location. Now, the bad news: This is a four story building without a working elevator. Hence, I had to schlep our luggage up four flights of stairs. They told me they have no elevator, but I found it the next morning with tape over the buttons. It was probably not working and they didn't feel like fixing it. We also had a problem with the airconditioning in our room, which by the way was the size of a walk-in closet. The hallways were ice cold. It took three phone calls the night we checked in to get someone to turn on the air. Each time we returned to our room, the air conditioning was off, yet the manager insisted it was working. I think they turn it off during the day when guests are out to save money. Then there was the continental breakfast, which consisted of 1 muffin or croissant, 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of O.J. I think they would be better off doing away with the free breakfast so they could save enough money to fix the elevator. Parking in the rear was adequate. The room was clean, but the towels were old and battered. Overall, if you need a place to sleep for a few nights and service is not your top priority, then I highly recommend this hotel."
16,1468,"May 23 2006	Can't go wrong either way....	After reading a couple of bad reviews of this place, my buddies and I thought that staying at this place would be a terrible idea--we were totally wrong. True, that this isn't exactly your Ritz Carlton, but remember that you get what you pay for. Don't expect a five-star hotel for $80 a night. It's basically your no frills hotel.Would this be a good hotel to bring the family? Maybe not. Is it a good place for young people to stay to save a couple bucks so they can party harder in Montreal? Absoutely.For a couple of young guys in our 20's, we had a memorable time in this hotel. Being on St. Denis, it's close to many popular restaurants, clubs, and bars. Interestingly enough, the hotel is right beside L'Axe strip club. That may be a good thing for some of you boys out there. It's also close to the St. Catherine scene (if you know what i'm talking about). And for those who like to party crazy until the sun comes up, Aria is just right down the street--the hotel is in a perfect location to stumble in for a late morning snooze. As well, the hotel is within reasonable walking distance to the popular St. Laurent club and bar scene.The hotel is crammed with many young money conscious people. So if you're looking for a couple of guys or gals to party with, this could be the place.There were a few negatives about this place:- First, the parking situation at the hotel was less than ideal. I did not trust parking my car behind the back alley of the hotel. Parking was very cramp and would only hold about 8-10 cars max. The parking was also very incovenient. You basically had to walk up to Ontario St. and then make your way down St. Denis to the hotel. - The rooms in the hotel are very small; however with some creative rearranging of the furniture, our standard one bed hotel room was able to house 3 guys and 2 air matresses.- Third, our hotel room had a really funky smell to it. The smell was so strong that I was able to notice the noxious odors while I passed out after a night of heavy drinking and partying.- Finally, the wake up call system was non-existent. We put in a wake up call for Sunday, May 21, 2006 at 11:00am and to this date we're still waiting for it; they never called. As well, there are no alarm clocks in the room, but thankfully cell phones have alarm clock features.The Latin Quarter definitely has some character to it. If you're looking to have a good time in Montreal and only need a hotel room to sleep, get intimate, and house your personal belongings, then this is the place for you. Montreal is a fantastic place with all its history, culture, nightlife, and most importantly, its dark-haried French beauties. It's a top-notch place to unwind and have a great time. When in Montreal, there's no need to be uptight. It's a great city and when you're having this much fun with all the things to do here, the hotel should be the last thing on your mind. Yes, I may have noted more negatives than positives, but I think this hotel rocks! I definitely would come back and stay at the Latin Quarter again; it's a great bang for your buck."
17,1468,"Apr 24 2006	Perfect Budget Hotel -- If you're not a crybaby.	I am utterly shocked at all the bad reviews about this hotel. Don't believe them!!! I'm 23 years old and have travelled extensively through Europe. If you are a young, budget traveller and have ever stayed in a hostel or pension, this place will make you very happy. It is rediculously cheap too. The location is amazing, especially if you are going to be going to nightclubs. We walked everywhere. I personally was extremely pleased. The staff was very helpful and spoke English. The towels were thin and scraggly but who cares, you are getting a budget hotel because you have no money, if you require plush towels then pay to stay somewhere nice, it doesn't take a genious to figure that out. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean. Since everyone is so hair obsessed on this site, here's what I have to say: There were 2 brown eyelashes on my pillow. I plucked them off the pillow and ate them because who cares about a couple of hairs?!!! You won't die. You won't even get sick. You won't get a disease. Brush them off. The sheets were obviously clean because they smelled like a fresh spring day. The room was BIGGER than expected. I was so inspired I hung up my clothes in the closet and put my socks in the drawers. I never do that. There was a TV. There was a hair dryer. There was soap. That is all you need. My girlfriend who is deathly afraid of bugs, hairs and stains and who refuses to stay in hostels was totally fine with this place. Not a complaint at all from her and that says alot.If you are an conservative adult who is used to staying in big chain hotels and never roughed it in your life, or you are the kind of person who demands an entirely new burger at a restaurant because they accidently put tomatoes on it and even if you take them off &quot;there's still a little bit of juice on it&quot;, or you used to tell the teacher when people cheated when you were in high school, or you correct people's grammar during ordinary conversation, or you home school your children... then don't stay here. You are obviously very uptight and picky. Go to the Holiday Inn where you can get all that complaining out of your system, snidely acting like a big shot when you tell the manager you are going to &quot;contact the regional offices about this.&quot; Hotel Quartier Latin is $60 Canadian for a room, are you nuts, what do you expect??!? Obviously this place isn't worth a 5. I mean its a 2 star hotel. But really, I was generally impressed by this place for the price. We got a double bed room for $74 Canadian. 2 couples sharing the room, we $20 each a night for our stay and loved every minute of it.PS- Budget minded, relaxed adults don't think that this is a &quot;party hotel.&quot; It was actually extremely quiet as well!!PPS- If you are under 25 years old and have a problem with this place, it's time to learn to &quot;chill out&quot; a little bit.COOL TRAVEL TIP:In this hotel, there is no stereo in the rooms... But the TV has auxillary inputs in the front. So, if you bring your iPod and the cable you use to connect it to a stereo (headphone jack to red and white plugs), you can plug that into the front of the TV and use the TV's speakers as a stereo!! Awesome!!"
18,1468,"Apr 11 2006	Disgusting Room	I was looking for a clean inexspensive room for a four day stay. I came across the Hotel Quartier Latin. I saw the pictures and thought well I am there for Montreal not the room. Upon arrival I found that the street was completely under constrution and that I could not drive up to the hotel. I had been in contact with the management just days before to confirm our reservations. The managment never once let us know that the street was completely torn apart. We tried several ways to get to the Hotel and finally just parked the car and walked. Once we got to the hotel there was only the cleaning staff and they only spoke french. I speak a some french and it was difficult to comunicate but we did understand each other. I was to go behind the hotel in a alley and find the rear entrance to the hotel and that is where I was to park. I didn't feel to good about leaving my car there but I had paid cash for parking. When we got to the room it was as big as a closet. I stripped the bed right away and found numberous hairs. Long black hairs. I both beds. The floor had not been vacuumed in days. It was digusting. Long hair and other stuff on the floor in the bathroom. I did go to the front desk and stated that I did not want the room. The young lady that was at the desk did not speak english but we were able to communicate that the manager would be there in just minutes. He arrived shortly and I explained that we were not happy with the room. He gave us a new room. It was bigger but the floor was disgustin. Stains everywhere. The floor had not been vacuumed in days. Again hair in the shower, long black hair. Hair on the floor. It was obviouse that the room had not been cleaned since the last person was there. We did decide to stay only because we were on a budget and also we felt that we would have a hard time to find another room since it was a weekend. The second day we asked the management to clean the room. Management with a stern and staight face tells us that the room will be cleaned that afternoon. We stated to him that the room had already been cleaned because the beds were made up but the floor was still dirty and that we had proof that the floor was not vacuumed and that there was long black hair in the bath room. He refused to see for him self and that he just continued to say the same thing over and over again that the room would be cleaned by the afternoon. Well it never did. We were there for four days and the room was never vacuumed or cleaned. It was the dirtiest room I have ever stayed in and i would never recommend the hotel to anyone. It was the one and only time I will ever stay there. It was just disgusting . As for the breakfast I never saw it, not even a hint of it. No service, no clean room, and the management could care less. Also the towels were the worst. Very linty and thin and scratchy. Just a bad experience from the get go."
19,1468,"Oct 3 2005	Great for the Price	After reading all the awful reviews i was nervous to stay at this hotel. The price was too good to be ignored though and my boyfriend and i kept the reservation. The hotel is in the center of the downtown montreal excitement. I would say this hotel is probably better for a younger crowd. This was all we saw for guests and it seemed apt. The walls are thin but except for a couple loud guys in the room next to us the last morning it was not a problem. The price we paid was near hostel prices and the accomodations were much more private with a full bath. The Creperie next door was wonderful as well, though slow service. We ate there both mornings. Staying away from the more touristy stuff we saw a lot of live jazz and blues for free. the artists were all friendly and interactive. Great stay over all. Better for people looking for a cheap place to stay instead of a romantic or a quite one."
20,1468,"Sep 26 2005	The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed	I selected this hotel because it was situated in downtown with most of the famous attractions within walking distance. Therefore the location was ideal. I and my husband stayed 2 nights. Our experience with the hotel during the 2 day stay is far from satisfying. First, the hotel staff is not friendly at all. They need to be taught how to smile! They did speak English which was very useful for us because we didnt speak French. But the staff needs to be trained on Personal Relations&quot; skills. We found them very unfriendly and depressing. Although the hotel advertises them as &quot;a friendly atmosphere with outstanding service&quot;, they are far from it.The rooms were small but manageable for a few nights sleep. I found the room and the bathroom to be surprisingly cleaner than expected. The free-continental b'fast cannot be called a continental b'fast at all. It is either one muffin or one croissant. Not both! The bfast was served by one of the staff. Why cant they allow the guests to serve themselves? On both days that we went to get bfast, the person who served the tea and croissant spilled the tea on my tray. I found them to be very clumsy and careless. How can this happen on both days??? Anyway, he did not offer to change my wet tray or the croissant. He just apologized and said he is new and offered an additional napkin!For parking, they charge $10 a day. If you park your car there, never, never hand your keys to the front desk. I was unlucky enough to hand them the keys so they car move the car within the car park. When I got in to the car the second day I found somebody has nipped my loose coins (kept to pay tolls) and a bag full of snacks away from the car and the hotel staff is clueless about it and wasnt very helpful when approached. We have stayed at many other hotels in the past and this hotel is by far the worst."
21,1468,"Sep 1 2005	What is everyone complaining about? It was great!	I guess there is no pleasing some people. From the moment my fiance and I arrived, we had a great experience.First of all, St. Denis proved to be such a cultural melting pool, with different ethnic cuisines everywhere you looked, and it literally begins at the base of the hotel steps. The maps and information located in the lobby proved to be indispensable, as well as the service from the front desk. Checkout time was a full 8 hours before our return flight home, but they offered to store our luggage while we spent another full, fantastic day wandering the streets downtown. Upon our return to the hotel, they had a taxi waiting for us! Couldn't have been more helpful. The Berri-Uqam metro station is a 2 minute walk away, and you will find 3 different major routes to access, that take you downtown, to close to Mount Royal, and following a short bus ride after the train, over to La Ronde and the FANTASTIC Casino Montreal (more fantastic due to the fact we left with more money than we walked in with!)As for the actual rooms, pretty small, but what more do you need from a room in Montreal than a bed, a TV, and a shower. Throw in a fridge to chill some wine, or a few beers, and fresh towels everyday, and who really cares about &quot;a smudge or two on the wall&quot;. A hair in the shower or sink? TURN THE WATER ON AND RINSE IT AWAY!!All in all, for $77 Canadian a night, we couldn't have imagined anything more perfect, and we plan on returning next year."
22,1468,"Aug 5 2005	Excellent Value Budget Hotel	If you are looking for a good value budget hotel right in the middle of Montreal's St-Denis street Nightlife you can't be better served. For a little under 60 Canadian Dollars I got a clean budget hotel in the center of town. I was actually looking on foot for something closer to where I usually go out at night than the Holiday-inn I had stayed in the year before was and for 1/3 the price I couldn't be happier. I don't spend much time in my room besides for sleeping, taking a shower and perhaps catching the news on the TV so in my case it did fine."
23,1468,"Aug 5 2005	Inexplicably bad service dirty rooms questionable honesty	My husband and I had a fine stay at the Hotel Quartier Latin earlier this year on the recommendation of a friend. Admittedly, the room was not as clean as it should have been -- there was hair in the shower and on the bathroom floor, and I'm still not sure what the smudge was on the toilet roll dispenser but I'd rather not think about it. But we were having such a good time we decided to let this slide, and booked again for July.What a mistake.I phoned in June and made a three-night reservation for late July. I received a confirmation number over the phone and assumed all was fine. When we arrived, everything again was fine, and I filled out a (completely blank) check-in card with my address, license plate info, etc. All seemed well and we settled into our very small but adequate room for two uneventful nights. There was a refrigerator in the room, great for my husband's medication, and the room was reasonably clean.On the morning of our third night, however, the problems began. The day clerk told us upon returning from brunch that he'd expected us to be out at noon. I explained that he was mistaken and we were reserved for three nights, and he said that was wrong and we would have to leave the hotel. I dug out my confirmation number and personal notes indicating the correct dates I had requested. The clerk, who had no real evidence to the contrary, attempted to convince me I had agreed at check-in that we were staying only two nights and that I had written it on the check-in card. This card was blank when I filled it in, and after the fact he had written in the dates to turn on and turn off the phone -- not real evidence at all. He then told me outright that I must be mistaken about the reservation because he would have tried to charge me $174 for the Saturday and not $89 as he had the previous two nights! Apparently there is no system for writing down reservations at the hotel with accurate information that he could show me, despite the fact that I had a confirmation number handy.The clerk attempted to call, or pretended to call, the hotel manager twice to discuss the situation and eventually said that he'd handle it himself since the manager &quot;probably wouldn't be as nice&quot; as he would. (?!?) His &quot;nice&quot; solution was to have us move rooms (why??????) and charge us not $89, $89 and $174, but rather $109, $109 and $109 for the three nights. Since I was reserved for $89, $89, and $89, I was put off to say the least. But since my husband is ill and we hadn't the time to reschedule anywhere else on a very busy night (with Gay Pride right behind the hotel -- hmm, do you think they were hoping we'd leave so they could get a better price?) we agreed to let the hotel charge us an extra $60 *just to continue staying there when we were already reserved*!Then we were not allowed to stay in our room since it was &quot;rented&quot; already, and were moved to a larger, much dirtier room! This room had no refrigerator, had black scuff marks on the wall next to one bed, hairs ALL OVER the sheets of both beds, and the bedside lamp was broken. It was an inexplicable and inexcusable &quot;solution&quot; to what was in the best case a mistake on their end, and the room was definitely not worth $109 no matter how busy a day it was. The clerk also tried to get me to pay him in total up front numerous times, despite having my credit card on file and my insistence that I would pay my balance in cash at check-out. Perhaps this was because he knew the next day's clerk was exceedingly bad at math, even with a calculator, as another reviewer mentioned. This actually worked in our favour as he failed to overcharge me *quite* as much as the other clerk had intended. I also complained at check-out about the dirty sheets and the clerk seemed confused and embarrassed, and when I mentioned that the lamp was broken, he just said, &quot;I don't know anything about the lamp.&quot;Add us to the list of &quot;never agains&quot;!"
24,1468,"Jul 9 2005	I should've taken pictures of the icky	If I had known I could post pictures to this site I would've taken photos of:1) The supposedly &quot;clean&quot; sheets which were covered in human hairs (well, by covered, I counted 18 different hairs). 2) The brownish/greenish/yellowish slimy mildew on the lovely, forest-photoed shower curtain.3) The weird stains on the carpet4) My boyfriend's face covered in white pills of cloth from the translucent towels. 5) The tacky picture that was fastened to the wall in an incredibly crooked position.6) The look on the staffer's face when I asked for new sheets (not nice).7) The cardboard bed.8) The yellow stains on the pillows.9) The bag of Fritos left behind from the last occupant.Overall, I don't expect much from a one-star hotel...but to me one-star is like a Motel-6. All i ask for are clean sheets, clean shower and a halfway decent mattress. Not here!First, there is no parking so be warned that you're going to have to park a block or so away which is about 40$ for 2 days. So it'll be worth spending an extra 40$ for a better hotel with parking.Second, expect to wait 25 minutes for someone to come to the desk to give you your key. We even tried calling the hotel from the front phone... the other phone just rang and rang and rang... Third, When dragging your luggage in, don't expect the staff to open the door for you. Instead, just let them watch you struggle.Fourth, When you ask for clean sheets, don't expect concern or even sheets right away. I got the inquisition even after I showed the guy all the hairs. He kept pointing to the creases telling me that was proof that they were clean. Fifth, you can't cancel a reservation completely. If you do, your cancellation fee is one night. You also have to give 48 hours notice. We wanted to cancel our 2nd night and were allowed the option of paying and giving up the room...even though they were sold out and could've sold it."
25,1468,"Jun 30 2005	Good deal for the price	Ok, this is a budget hotel, so everything feels kinda cheap, but for the price I felt it I got good value for money.We stayed there 4 nights, my wife and I had a double room (one double bed) and my sister stayed in a single room.The hotel does provide breakfast: coffee or tea, orange juice and either a croissant or a muffin (both from costco). Breakfast won't win any awards but for a budget hotel its nice to get something to start your day of site seeing not on an empty stomach. The rooms were of fine size, included a small table with two chairs, a small closet and dresser and a bathroom. There was enough floor space to open our suitcases and still walk around and use the table. There was no in-room coffee maker, but the TV worked fine. The hotel is centrally air conditioned but you can't control the temperature from your room, when we were there they tended to keep it a little on the cool side, which I liked though my sister did not. Location: The hotel is in lively rue St Denis which is just wonderful. It really comes alive at night (the street, not the hotel) and is full of great restaurants. Even late at night there are lots of people on the street (not scary at all) all going to and from the local eateries. During our four nights there we ate at a different restaurant every night, all were great and none were more than 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Note however, that the hotel is not in downtown, it's about 15-20 minutes walk from there. This is a short distance that I don't think will be an issue to a tourist who expects to spend the whole day walking from site to site. In any event, the subway station is only 4 minutes walk from the hotel, so it's not a big deal anyway.There is no parking in the hotel and the street is always packed. There is no elevator.Finally, do bear in mind that this is a budget hotel, so don't expect the level of decor or the quality of the furnishings to reach that of the more expensive chain hotels. If you keep in mind what you paid and use the money you save to enjoy eating out at one of the many fine restaurants on rue St Denis I think you'll be satisfied."
26,1468,"Jun 23 2005	The worst experience of my life!	This place is a dump! No parking, small rooms, dirty carpets, poor service from hotel staff, bad continental breakfast, etc. I visit Montreal quite frequently (3-4 times a year), and there are many other hotels that offer a better value in the downtown area. Don't even bother with this one!"
27,1468,"Jun 6 2005	Didn't give us our reservations!	This hotel looked great on the internet, from the outside, and in the lobby. However, when we arrived, we were told that &quot;there was water damage&quot; in our room and would not be able to stay there. However, they arranged for us to stay at the Hotel Europeene. Another bad choice. They &quot;forget&quot; reservations and try to pawn you off on a worse place."
28,1468,"Apr 5 2005	It was great!	We stayed there last summer in July 2004, during the Just for Laughs comedy festival. The hotel was right in the middle of the festival, which made getting there a bit confusing, but once we were settled it was great to be in the middle of everything. The room was small yet clean, and we had no problems at all with our stay there. I would definately reccommend it!"
29,1468,"Oct 7 2004	Cheap hotel in a central location if you don't mind a dirty room	My boyfriend an I stayed at this hotel this past weekend. The location's great for the price, but beware, rooms are not kept clean. We found hair in the bathtub, the sink and in our sheets. Another thing to beware of is that the heat and air conditioning is cotrolled at the front desk. We had to constantly call and ask to have the air conditioning put on. Very disapointed, would not return."
30,1468,"Aug 9 2004	Good Hotel for the Price	For the price, this hotel is a very good buy. It is not a five star hotel, and does not claim to be. There is no elevator but you can get some assistance with taking your luggage up if you wish. The staff was most cheerful and courteous. We never came in or went out without someone greeting us. The cleaning staff was efficient. The contenintal breakfast was served with a smile and the croissants were warm and the muffins fresh. Children were treated very kindly. Rooms are small, but beds are comfortable and clean. (Who cares what you see when you look out the window.) We went for the Montreal Jazz Festival and were just a short walk from the main stage. For the money, you cannot find anything more satisfactory. And frankly, we did not see any ants as was mentioned in another review."
31,1468,"Jul 26 2004	Fantastic Location and Decent Value But the Staff is Inconsistent	I stayed here for two nights from 24-25 July 2004, in a single room, #410, on the top floor for C$69+tax. Although my floor was technically the 4th floor, the 2nd floor was actually street level and 1st floor the basement, so I only had to haul my luggage up 2 flights of stairs. I found my room adequately clean, basically furnished and ok-sized, given that this is a budget, European-style hotel (i.e. small rooms and few frills). At least I could move around the room without having to worry about banging my arm or feet against something. My room was at the back of the hotel with a view of the back alley and some parking lots beyond, but I did manage to get a glimpse of the fireworks on Saturday night when the International Fireworks Competition was active. The TV with cable channels was quite well sized for the room, probably 21-inch. The rationed breakfast was available in the breakfast room during the short time frame of 8-10am, and I never bothered to eat there because of the wealth of cafes and breakfast places immediately outside the hotel. Parking is available in a parking lot 1-2 minutes away by foot, but the price varies from free to C$10, depending on how busy the hotel is and who you speak to. Basically the hotel maintains a couple of monthly passes at the lot which they then give to guests. I stayed during a busy weekend (much of the Latin Quarter was pedestrianised for the Francofolies festival) and paid C$7 per day for the parking. The staff can be friendly, but the guy who did my bill was lousy with math (even with a calculator), so check your bill carefully. The biggest selling point of the hotel is the location - close to the UQAM subway station and the Central Station for trains, and right in the middle of the Latin Quarter on rue St-Denis. One will not starve or thirst here."
32,1468,"Feb 23 2004	Basic but in a great location	This is a basic hotel, but clean, cheap, and in a great location.It's surrounded by lively restaurants - there's a great vegetarian buffet across the road, and Italian, Thai, pizza, Chinese etc just a few doors away. There is a university in the area, so there are lots of people out and about till quite late and it feels quite safe. It's toward the fringes of the restaurant area, so the rooms are quiet.It's very easily walkable to Old Montreal and, if you like walking a little further, to many other great areas. Although there's no parking onsite, it's only one block away from a major subway station. The subway will take you around town and to all major tourist attractions, and also to the shuttle that goes to the airport.The rooms are small, but adequate, and have a small refrigerator. The views are of the surrounding streets etc, but if you're going there for the location and price, they really don't matter! The tvs only have basic channels, so plan to see Montreal while you are there!Breakfast is simple, but nice, with croissants, muffins, various cereals, juice and coffee, and they will try to give you as much as you can carry!CONS: There are no laundry facilities, however we were told that there was one nearby if we needed it. There was also no iron available, so bring non-wrinkle fabrics, but they do provide drawers and hangers. If you like thick toilet paper and towels, bring your own, but they will happily provide more if you need them. Next door is a strip club, but it has pleasant security guys, you can't see in, and the rest of the area is nice. It never bothered us, however if you are taking your family and don't want to explain what it is ....In conclusion, this is a great budget hotel (we paid approx CA$70), in a lively and convenient location. We recommend it to other budget travellers, but don't expect luxury."
33,1468,"Oct 14 2003	Very frustrating stay	We researched hotels (but unfortunately not the previous and very accurate review that someone else already left) and found this hotel in the heart of the city. We paid $120 a night for what we were told was a very nice, large room. The room was smaller than any hotel room I'd ever seen. The carpets were gross, there was NO parking (and I had been guaranteed parking when I called as I knew we were arriving at midnight on a Friday). After 7 hours of driving and just wanting to get settled, I arrived and was told I had to drive around crowded city streets and try to find an open lot with space. I never saw any sort of breakfast.We ended up cancelling the rest of the nights and went to the Holiday Inn. It was the same price for a very nice exective room in a clean hotel with concierge, an indoor pool, gym, sauna, parking and city views. I can't believe the Quartier Latin was charging as much."
34,1468,"May 27 2003	Worst Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In! Beware!	I went to this hotel because Orbitz showed that it was 2 star, close to Catherine St., city view, and parking available. What A Lie! It was close to Catherine St, however, there was NO parking, in fact we had to park in a garage two blocks away and make two trips back and forth to our car in the parking garage, the cost of parking was expensive. Our room was on the fourth floor (no elevevator) and the room was overlooking the &quot;city&quot; which was really just a dumpster out back. It gets worse... I left a bag of cookies on the nightstand and went out for a few hours, and when I came back there was a huge ant infestation in the room, all over my clothes, in my bed, and all over the cookies. I told the person at the front desk, and at first he suggested we spray the ants with something to kill them, after enough arguing, he agrees to move us to a new hotel, two blocks away... making all our belongings 4 blocks away from our car. WHAT A PAIN IN THE ***!!! Not to mantion the room is the size of a broom closet! Oh yeah, the continental breakfast is a frickin muffin and a croissant that they must have bought down the street... and out front the sign reads &quot;bead and breakfast.&quot; Dont be taken for a fool! BEWARE!!!"
35,1468,"May 3 2003	A good cheap stay!	We took a chance on this cheap hotel ($64 CA a night) and were pleasantly surprised.

This is a pure business hotel with decent breakfast and good rooms to stay. The building is very old. However the rooms are well maintained and there is a pool and GYM at the top floor of the building. There are no restaurants inside the hotel but a 5 minute walk from the hotel gives u lots of options to eat out. A very nice and good Value for Money hotel for business travellers.

I was pleasantly surprised by this Residence Inn for its cleaniness, good location, and friendly staff.What I liked:+ Full breakfree+ Helpful, friendly bilingual staff + Good location - close to downtown Montreal business districtWhat I disliked:- parking"
3,1471,"Oct 21 2009 	Friendly helpful staff. Good breakfast and good location.	Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Hotel lobby was very clean and inviting. We stayed here because we needed the separate bedroom and kitchenette for a family (parents and toddler). Hotel offered a crib free of charge, but we had our own. Our rate included free breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was very good. Offered was eggs, waffles, pancake, bacon, sausage, variety of breads and bagels, cereals, fruit, yogurts, coffee, tea and juices. Nice location on a quiet residential street near Dawson College. Two blocks away is Atwater Metro station. If you have a car, there is a nice outdoor lot two blocks from the hotel on Rue Sherbrooke. The rate is 7$ CAD per day. You pay by leaving exact change in an envelope in a mail slot. Lot is very safe and spaces are always available. No attendant, come and go as you please. Also two blocks away is Rue Sainte-Catherine. There you will find all sorts of restaurants; easily walk-able. Also, where Atwater Metro station is, there is a shopping mall that offers retail stores, a supermarket, and even a discount store similar to a Wal-Mart."

5,1471,"Jul 10 2009 	Not the best Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights with my husband who is in Montreal on business. Here what I wish I had known before being stuck there.The pool is very small, the photos on the web site make it seem much bigger. The &quot;sauna&quot; is a closet sized room in the individual bathrooms. The pool and fitness room closes relatively early (as do most places in Montreal). i asked if I could sit on the Patio, apparently it is more commonly referred to as a terrace, but no I could not sit outside in the sunshine, this was reserved for special use by the hotel. Several times the elevator got stuck on our floor, the doors would open, close, open, close. When we told the front desk he just said the elevators were old and sometimes you had to jump up and down a little to get it to work...c'est la vie!! Unbelievably I actually tried this, it didn't work. The balconies off the rooms seem like an after thought in the construction of the building, slabs of concrete, jutting out and pitched slightly at an angle downward, I assume to let the water run off from the cooler, which seems to be a swamp cooler, in a place with 80% humidity??? It was very, very noisy. The internet works well enough, but it's not wireless, like wireless internet is some newfangled technology in Canada. There was no table to eat at in our room, which was smaller than the suites. My husband's employer PRE-PAIDED for this room, but they tried to check him out prematurely twice. They also charged $200 to the credit card he gave (for things we might charge to the room) 5 DAYS AFTER WE CHECKED IN!! The explanation given by the front desk was they had to &quot;make sure the card worked&quot;, so they arbitrarily charge $200, 5 days after we check in, without informing us they are going to do this. Front desk guy defended this logic saying &quot;all hotels do this&quot; and that &quot;What if we put a hole in the wall&quot;...Ummm, not any I've stayed in. And finally, the parking in expensive, $17.00 a night.OK, here are the positives, for me, anyway. The beds were comfortable and the pillows down. The maid would do our dirty dishes for us. The room was clean. There is a laundry downstairs, $1.50 Canadian to wash and dry. There is a pretty big free breakfast. It's close to the metro (Atwater) and Starbuck.Here's my advice, if you're over 22, stay in old Montreal. This is a college neighborhood, a little weird, and not a lot for a tourist to do."
6,1471,"Jun 28 2009 	Well run hotel	I'm staying here for a long period, for business travel. The rooms are large, reasonably well fit out, and with a simple kitchen, and balcony. The staff are helpful, there is a good breakfast included, and the rooms are clean. There's a basic gym and pool on the top floor.. with a nice view of the mountain.An extra lift would be appreciated... 2 lifts for 20 floors leaves you waiting quite often."
7,1471,"May 11 2009 	Nice people hard beds.	If you don't mind sleeping on a brick, the place is nice. Another drawback is no hot tub, (which you will need by the end of the long walks you will be taking). Good breakfast with a lot of choices."
8,1471,"Sep 29 2008 	Not up to par at all	Stayed for a weekend at this hotel. I usually check reviews for any hotel that I am planning to stay at and this was no exception. This hotel has very decent reviews here and other places. I was very disappointed however and I am not a picky traveler, just want to get my moneys worth.I was surprised at how small and uncomfortable the rooms were and how old/dated the rooms/things in the room were. It was nice to have a kitchen but everything was old. The bed was small and uncomfortable, the sheets old and torn in some places, same with the towels. You dont expect this at a Marriot.The room was clean but old and uncomfortable. This hotel is advertised as 3-4stars but it is no way even close. It was like staying at a decent motel. However the price of $150.00 per night is insane for this place. It is not worth half that price. I stayed at 4Seasons last year for the same price in a much better hotel in a better location.Location is ok but nothing to write home about, you are better off staying on Sherbrooke between University and St. Laurent. There was always street parking available nearby so that is a plus. it was also nice to have a balcony, but it was not very useful since they dont even have any chairs or anything out there and you cant even smoke cigarettes on the balcony. I am not a smoker but it seemed like a strange rule for an outdoor balconyOverall it is a decent motel experience but really bad for the value. For 150 a night, I expect way better rooms."
9,1471,Sep 2 2008 	Worst Hotel Ever...Ever	I personally prefer to stay at the Residence Inn (Business or Leisure). This was the worst hotel I have stayed at so far. Our stay started with the horrible parking experience. There were about 10 parking spots per floor in the underground parking. I had to wait there for about half an hour to find an empty spot. Then there was the elevator wait. I stood by the elevator for 15 min every time for it to arrive(I was on the 7th floor and started using the stairs in and out after experiencing the same problem about 2 times). Then there was the room. The fridge was at least 20 years old with a loud squeaking noise. Old carpet with a nasty smell. The balcony was filthy with algae on the floor from the water leaking out of the air conditioner. The front doors squeaked. The thermostat did not work. There was no exhaust in the washroom. The sofa bed was the most uncomfortable nights sleep ever. And they charge $1 for every local call.Upon complaining about the above the response from the front desk was &quot;We are working to make things better&quot;. They did not offer any fixing or regrets.Never again will I stay here. I travel quite a lot to Montral. I would suggest the four points hotel (Same price much better service with the valet parking).
10,1471,"Sep 2 2008 	Location OK Service Great Lots of kids	I booked this hotel with Marriott Reward Points, so I cannot comment on prices and value. This was a last minute trip as I re-routed to avoid Hurricane Gustav and did little or no advance planning on he trip which required a higher level of staff assistance than I would normally ask for.Getting there: The hotel is located in a residential area of Montreal about 2 miles west of downtown. If you have two or more people, its probably not a bad idea to get a cab directly to the property. The flat rate of C$38 is competitive with the C$30 fare for two people on the L'Aerobus shuttle service from the airport. If you do take the bus, you will get dropped off at the main bus terminal. From there you can go downstairs to the Berri/UQAM metro station and ride to Atwater. Come out of the station on the Rue Maisonneuve side and walk a half block north on Rue Atwater to Lincoln. The hotel is a block down past a couple of old apartment complexes.Check in: Slow. The hotel had a couple of groups checking in at that time and the check-in desk has room only for two agents to handle the load. They did the best that they could.Room: Small. When I was promised a double room, they weren't joking. Its a double bed rather than a queen which is a good bit smaller than I am used to. Appliances in the kitchen look really old, but are functional. There is a small den area with a desk and a large balcony. Internet is free in the room, but as is the case with Marriotts I stay at, it is not wireless. But when its free, I will take what I can get. The toilet did not flush when I arrived. But it did get fixed almost immediately after I notified the front desk.Staff service: Really great. As I said, I was in a bot of a pinch and did virtually no advance planning. The staff was able to help me out with opening and closing times, directions and recommendations. This was pretty key since Labor Day is a holiday in Canada at the same time as in the US. Everything is closed on Labor Day. Overall, very friendly and cheerful folks and I am glad they were there.Breakfast: Big fan of the free Residence Inn breakfast. But this is a family hotel if every I stayed at one. Breakfast was overrun with kids and the atmosphere was more Romper Room than hotel. I suppose that makes it &quot;family friendly&quot;. But it also means that I also lost my breakfast plate a couple of times dodging the kiddies running around. Still it was a generally good selection of breakfast foods.Overall impressions of the hotel were OK. The biggest problem here is not something that will surprise the staff if they read this. Its the elevators. If you are above the 10th floor and want to go downstairs, plan ahead. If the elevator is not headed in the direction you want, get on. Ride it up and then back down. At least you are on, which is more than I can say to some of the poor souls who found a full elevator when it arrived at their floor.This really isn't a pheonomenal location for exploring Old Montreal but its OK. Atwater requires a change of train to get to the Orange Line and it can be a bit of a walk at the end of the day when you are beat to get back to the metro and then back to the hotel. Still, you are only two stops away from Peel Station which is where a lot of the action is on Ste Catherine Street. Given the choice, I would have tried to get a room downtown or in Old Montreal. I think the prices are generally competitive with the 3-star set downtown."
11,1471,"Aug 28 2008 	Reasonable rates and very comfortable	This hotel is a little out of the way - but close to the metro station.It was very reasonably priced and includes a fully equipped kitchen and a little balcony.The staff are really friendly and helpful - even to an English speaker like me.Very reasonable and comfortable,"

We got a special deal so the rate was very competitive, particularly because it includes a full hot buffet breakfast every day. The breakfast is not brunch at the Ritz Carlton, but it was always a nice start to our day. Our room was a suite with a fully equipped kitchen as well as a balcony offering a panorama of the city. It was clean and in very good condition. The hotel has a nice rooftop indoor pool which we used a couple of times. The parking garage with in/out privileges was another nice feature. The only complaint I share with others is the elevator situation in the hotel; there are only two and at peak times you may wait for up to five minutes to get one. I travel frequently and in general I am a big fan of Marriott, they are very customer focused and their product is very consistent, The Westmont is no exception."
13,1471,"Aug 17 2008 	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights recently. The room was neat and clean - we had a bedroom, living room, balcony and kitchen stocked with everything you'd need if you wanted to stay in and cook. The breakfast was wonderful - hot and cold food, lots of variety and nicely laid out. The staff were very friendly and helpful - the front desk recommended several nearby restaurants - we tried two and they were great. It's located in a very pleasant neighbourhood. The metro is only two blocks away, and from there you can get anywhere in Montreal quickly and efficiently. Old Montreal and China town are ten minutes away by Metro, and the botanical gardens about twenty minutes away. Overall - a great place to stay."
14,1471,"Aug 2 2008	Great Service!	This is a great hotel with excellent service. Right near Attwater subway and huge shopping centres, its close enough to the city and restaurants. The service is fantastic and we enjoyed a great apartment with kitchenette and spacious surroundings. We would recommend this hotel for its functional rooms, great staff, good breakfasts and position."
15,1471,"Jul 21 2008 	Residence Inn Montreal Westmount not up to par	I generally prefer staying at the Residence Inn chain. I don't know if the standards for the properties is lower in Canada versus the United States but this place was expensive for what it offered. First, while the room had a kitchen(outdated!) there was no dining table nor chairs nor a sofa and coffee table (as I have experienced at other Residence Inns). Secondly, the bed was hard as a rock and the carpeting was so thin, there was no doubt you were walking on a concrete slab floor. Thirdly, while the public spaces were newly decorated, the rest of the space felt like an old apartment building that had been converted into a hotel. If you like Residence Inns, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you are looking for a nice hotel, I would shop around because this wasn't even a nice hotel."
16,1471,"Jul 12 2008 	Good hotel but OLD and not close to anything	The hotel was good, but the elevator was not working for a while, and there is only one computer downstairs to use for internet.Room was clean and nice... but you can tell the hotel is OLD.When I flush the toilet the sink does not have cold water until the toilet fills up.And this hotel is not close to the good stuff in Montreal, so look for other hotels if you want to be close to all the big events in Montreal.I paid $149, would only stay here again for $120 tops."
17,1471,"Jul 9 2008 	Just OK - family with young children	This hotel has a lovely lobby and a wonderful breakfast. The staff were very nice.The room we were in was in bad need of renovation, though. It smelled of smoke (gross!!!) even though it was supposedly non-smoking. The rooms were redecorated maybe in the 80s, so things look a bit tired and old there. Also the toilet kept clogging. All the thresholds of the doors we saw had these huge bump-like lips, making them difficult to traverse with a stroller (and I'll bet a wheelchair too). Wheelchair accessible door button did not work from outside the hotel, either."
18,1471,"Jan 21 2008	Good apartment style hotel	I've stayed in this hotel multiple times for business and it is a nice apartment style hotel. There have been times when the room that I was given had problems with hot water. I mentioned this and was told to keep the water running for awhile. Othertimes there weren't any problems with the hot water. The reception desk will call you about 30 minutes after you check in to verify that everything is okay. This is the only hotel that I've stayed at which does this. The gym is okay (1 treadmill, 1 stairmaster, free weights). Being an apartment style hotel, it has a full size fridge (with freezer), a stove, utensils, pots, microwave, dish washer, etc. which I find to be very useful. They sometimes have free early evening snacks depending on the day (schedule posted on fridge). The free breakfast buffet is very good. The parking is indoor (pay $) and underneath the hotel (accessible from hotel without exiting). The parking allows for multiple ins/outs and you pay per day/stay. The hotel is located in a quiet 1 way side street at the outer edge of downtown (near westmount). It is considered to be downtown for all intensive purposes. The hotel is completely non-smoking. The free internet is wired."
19,1471,"Aug 8 2007 	Very Good Value	I recently stayed at the Residence Inn in Westmount for two nights on business. I am from Montreal originally and know the area well. The location is very good, being close enough to downtown without being &quot;too&quot; close. It is on a quiet sidestreet and although the building looks fairly ordinary (cement highrise) the interiors are spotless. Check in was fast and efficient, and the rate of $129 / night was more than reasonable considering what other downtown hotels charge. Their underground parking is for small cars only (they warn you about this), and there is plenty of street parking nearby which is free from 8 pm to 9 am. I would save the $$$ and park on the street.The rooms are very well kept, with full kitchenettes (a microwave, a range and a fridge). The only minor issue was with the noise level of the AC, which could be better. But it was not something that kept me awake. The hot breakfast (included) is outstanding and far superior to the usual boring fare. Very good quality buffet-style food, with yogourts, breads, cereals, etc. Top notch.This is not a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel, but is an excellent value. I will certainly stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone."
20,1471,"Jul 26 2007 	Great room and view	Our family stayed here during our recent summer vacation. We arrived quite late (22:00ish) and the girl at the front desk gave us a reception that we thought we were in Paris :-( However, the next morning, the continental breakfast is something else; the waffle is so good I can sit there and eat them all day. The room are comfortable but for those who are afraid of height, get the room on the lower floor. Otherwise, the view from our room is marvelous (we are on the 18th floor) ! Don't expect the american standard of Residence Inn (ie. soap, tissue, ... ) there's none whatsoever. One precaution: imo, the room may not be sound proof ( I can hear my children running in the room from the elevator). The swimming is small but if your room does not have the view, come up to the PH floor and have a great tan !"
21,1471,"Jan 12 2007 	Wonderful Property	Stayed at this property Jan 5-9, 2007. The location is a little ways out from the &quot;tourist&quot; areas, but it was not a bad walk to Rue St Catherine or Blvd Maisonneuve were one could find plenty of restaurants and shops. The metro (which gets you to many sites in the city) was only 2 blocks from the hotel. The neighborhood is not beautiful but encountered no problems, hotel exterior is blah but the lobby/public areas are very comfortable. Checkin/out was very quick and efficient, the hotel personel were very friendly - greeted everyone in English &amp; French and then in the guests language on subsiquent meetings. The room was basic - but all I need is a good bed and a bathroom. The room had those plus a balcony and a fully equiped kichen. Our room was next to the elevator but the bathroom blocked any noise from it &quot;entering&quot; the rest of the room. It was nice to have the option of the buffet breakfast - the menu was scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, waffles, a variety of cereals, fruit, yogurt, and breads/pastries. Very good selection. The pool was on the top floor and very nice (on a clear day probably had a great view). Will definately stay at this property on future visits to Montreal."
22,1471,Oct 29 2006 	Wonderful stay	when i arrived at the hotel in Montral i was greeted by the housekeeping staff on strike... apon checking in the hotel and arriving in the room i open the curtains and to my shock there was dirt on the outside of the window (there were doing renovations on the balcony) breakfast was good the staff was not very helpful at all sent me in the wrong area twice when i received the proper directions the front desk manager i was quite pleasant and gave me the directions for the area I was looking for. I will say this staff over all was exactly was I expected in a Marriott property.
23,1471,"Jul 24 2006 	Not bad but not really a hotel	I have to say first that the Residence Inn was once a medium sized apartment building that has been converted into a hotel. So, keep that in mind. First, the hotel is very clean; rooms, foyer, etc. I never saw any problems whatsoever, and I like rooms clean! My friend stayed there 3 years ago, and I stayed there (with same friend) in July 2006. I'm not too sure about the $175 cdn per night, think it could be more like $120?The lobby is just like in the pictures. As mentioned by others, there are only 2 elevators, so you may have to wait a little bit, but not terrible. The free breakfast wasn't bad. My friend mentioned that is was a continental breakfast, but there was cereal, yogurt, small pancakes, sausage patties, scrambled eggs, bread, bagels, juice, tea and coffee. You could eat here no problem, but the pancakes were a little dry and flat :( They also have free hors-d'oeuvres about 4 nights during the week. One night they had chicken nuggets, salad, mini quiche, bread rolls, juice, and coffee/tea. So, having said that, I will say that if you are used to big name hotels that have the nice buffet set out, looking all pretty, you will not find it at the Residence. It is much more casual fare, something you may throw together for yourself and your kids if your were at home, but still laid out okay. The room in which they serve the food is small, and can be a bit noisy. There are a number of tables out in the lobby area, which are more quiet, and cooler. We had a room on the 14th floor, which was clean and bright. The furniture was clean, did not appear well used at all, and was comfortable. I slept in the king size bed in the bedroom, and my friend slept on the pull out couch. You have to make up the bed in the pull out, so be prepared for that--bed stuff is in the hall closet. I read stuff about the A/C being loud, but you know, that is with a lot of hotels, but not the big name ones. It wasn't extremely loud, but it reminded me of when my family and friends have stayed in motels with window A/C, so it is about that noise level, but it didn't bother us. There was plenty of space to put away clothing, etc. There is large closet in bedroom, along with drawers in chest. Also chest of drawers in living room in front of pull out couch. The kitchen is great, having all utensils, plates, pots, etc for you. Great size fridge, but microwave probably should be replaced. Stove was older, but very clean. There is a balcony for each hotel room, but, it is a standard apartment balcony, with no chairs or anything, and there is some water which is just from the air conditioner unit. Also, people may go out there to smoke, and our balcony had not been cleaned of cigarette butts. I didn't really care, because I would never use the balcony anway, but the &quot;dirtiness&quot; of it could turn people off.Now to the comments about the general area. Yes, this area of Montreal is not like being directly downtown. You walk down the end of the street, and you see graffiti, and some people don't take care of their gardens. It almost seems dirty looking sometimes. There are a lot of panhandlers/beggars, whatever you want to call them. I think Montreal needs to do a clean sweep of these people. That was one thing that turned me off, and may turn off a lot of tourists that are not used to that. You will have to walk by them (most of them are sitting) but be prepared for some of them to come right up to you. Again, just make a point of walking away. Most of these people were on the main streets, and also in downtown Montreal. This is a Montreal problem, cause they are everywhere.I will say that I never felt unsafe. I think the area might make you feel that way, just because it doesn't look great, etc, but my friend and I walked at night a few times, but there were also other people out, and we were okay. If you are someone who really likes the large name hotel experience (room service, large foyers, restaurant, lots of elevators, immaculate rooms, etc, etc), then do NOT go to this hotel. Go to one of the hotels in direct downtown Montreal. If you can handle the idea that for your stay, it would be like living in an apartment building, but with free food, and front desk help, then you could probably handle staying here. You have to remember, this is a RESIDENTIAL area, not the pristine streets of a metropolitan city. If you want shops, be really close to old Montreal, etc, then go to the downtown hotels. Have I made you understand what type of hotel this is? Like I said, it would be like living in an apartment in a residential area of Montreal. No fancy shwancy stuff. It is quiet, there are no problems there. Again, I want to prepare you that Montreal is not always clean looking, the graffiti, etc may turn you off as you start walking down to the main street, and which you may see at their Metro (train station), but other than that, Montreal is a busy, interesting place, with MANY places to eat. If you want some interesting nightlife, go to Crescent street. Montrealers love their patios, and this street is full of them, and is THE partying place at night, mostly Friday and Saturday. For a great breakfast, go to Burgers&amp;Benedicts (at the Pepsi Forum, just a couple blocks down). I had the 2 eggs with meat plate for $6.00, and it came on a big plate. Lots of bacon and grilled potatoes, etc. Very good food. Have a great time if you go, and make sure you visit old Montreal, it is fascinating with the architecture, cobbled streets, etc."
24,1471,"Jul 12 2006	Quiet but inconvenient location	I should first say that I don't travel much and have only stayed at a few hotels in the past. The reviews I read didn't seem too bad, and since this hotel is run by Marriott I decided to give it a try. I was going away for just the weekend so I wanted a nice, comfortable place to stay. My room was indeed comfortable, clean, and quiet and also spacious. I booked a one bedroom queen suite and there was a separate bedroom, living area including a dining table and desk, and kitchen. More than enough for just one person. This hotel is ideal for families and others who plan to stay in Montreal for over a week. I was so busy, I didn't even have time to use the kitchen, which was one of the main reason's I chose this hotel. If you are only going to stay in Montreal chose another hotel. Residence is on the very edge of downtown, and I was very disappointed to be so far from the action because I had hoped to walk to most places, but the only way to get to any attractions is by taking the Metro or a cab. Stay somewhere more centrally located. But I will say that there is a Metro station close by and the front desk staff are very friendly. Also, the room I stayed in, room 1703, though the balcony was closed for repairs, I had a great view of the mountain, so be sure to ask for a room on that side of the building."
25,1471,"Jul 10 2006	Somewhat Disappointed....	We stayed at the Residence Inn this past weekend and I can't say it was a miseralble time but I have stayed in much better hotels. This was a last minute trip and this hotel was right for the price and it had a small kitchen where we could make our own breakfast. The staff was super nice and friendly. My only problems with this hotel was that the parking garage was horrible. Too small and cramped and very expensive for what you have to go through to park. But better than getting a ticket for the residential area parking.I was really upset to see that on top of the 34+ dollars I was charged for the parking, I also had to pay for local calls!! I had no clue that calling a restaurant around the corner would cost me nearly $1.50. And we called several. Nice surprise when ready to check out! Overall the hotel was very clean and neat. I brought my own pots to cook in and the cleaning lady did not put them into the dishwasher, uuuuurrrrggggghhhh! But all of the other dishes that were in the sink were put in. Was also ticked that the hotel advertises that each room has a private balcony. You cannot go onto the balconies as there is construction going on. If you need someplace to stay on a whim, for not too much money, then this is your best bet but I am sure there are much better hotels in the area. Note: This hotel is really close to a university and thus the neighborhood is in not such a good condition. Seemed somewhat safe though."
26,1471,"Jun 26 2006	As bad as they say	We stayed there for a few days for a wedding. It is a good location near the old Forum. The hotel has lots of problems. The construction is one - first the garage is a mess. Bad to begin with, add the braces and it is awful.Union is on strike - hope you like a choice of contruction noise or union chants. The temporary housekeeping is not great. They left tthe door open on my parents room.We had a hotel room. Should have stayed in Old Montreal at the Springhill suites - and had a nice room.We had a cubby kitcken. That was fine. But no place to eat - we had a desk chair (and desk) and another chair but no table to eat at. Also, only 2 dresser drawers. When I asked they said that this type room did not have these things and it is a Residence Inn so no place to put suite cases. KInd of worse of all worlds. We stayed in Syracuse at the Courtyard and in Toronto in a Courtyard and they where much better. Marriott should get rid of this blemish on their reputation. I would never stay there again."
27,1471,"Mar 12 2006 	Not as bad as some describe (for me at least)	I can't say I was much impressed with this hotel. On the other hand I have little to complain about either.Something that will help you understand the previous reviews: this property used to be an apartment building. That explains why there are only 2 small elevators.The room I had used to be an apartment, so it had a large bedroom, a living room, and a kitchen. The price included a breakfast but it was pretty basic. I went the first 2 monrnigs and skipped it for the rest of my stay -- it's just not worth it.To be sure there are better hotels in Montreal, but this one is not all that bad."
28,1471,"Nov 16 2005	Disappointed Stay	I am a Silver Member and travel a lot during the year, i have stayed in different Marriott in Canada and USA, this is the worst one. Residence Inn Downtown (the one close to Peel metro station) is a lot better. We have reserved 2 rooms more than a month in advance and have requested close to each other , but when checked in the staff said the 2 rooms would be at different floors. Only after i repeated my request that they said there were 2 rooms next to each other, how come they did not arrange that in the first place! Then the breakfast room was crowded and there was a kitchen lady who was very rude. As the room was crowded, so we took food upstair but she questioned us in a very impolite manner. This ruin the start of the day. The a/c was very noisy and the lighting in living room was not sufficient. Have to wait the elevator for a long time, sometimes i have to use stair even i was at 8 floor. At check-out day no invoice was at our door at 7am, (but we have asked the front desk that we would got one at 5am on day of departure). There were errors on the invoice and the staff did not know how to fix it and asked us to wait til next shift to ask the day time staff. Would never stayed in this hotel in future."
29,1471,"Aug 27 2005	Don't stay at this hotel...very dissapointing for a Mariott	As a silver elite Mariott Rewards member I stay at Residence Inn properties very often. This one is not deserving of the Mariott name and is certainly nowehere near the standard of your typical Residence Inn. Quite frankly, it was a dump. I must say however that the front desk staff was very friendly but that is the only positive comment I can make. Here were the problems: noisy a/c, tiny room, insufficent elevators (waited 20 mins to get to our room), no ice machines except for the top floor and the ice tray in our freezer was empty, crumbling outside deck without any chairs, uncomfortable bed and linens, poor quality towels (2 of them were stained). I would never stay at this property again. If the Mariott folks ever review it themselves I'm confident they would dump this place. I still trust the Mariott name, but certainly not like I did before staying at this hotel. Do yourself a favour and stay elsewhere in beautiful Montreal."
30,1471,"Jul 28 2005	worst Residence Inn I have stayed at	I read some complimentary reviews but maybe those folks don't travel much or have kids and just want a place to crash and eat take -out pizza.Depends on what you are looking for, but I have stayed at some very good Residence Inns in the southern part of the US and outside Toronto. This was not one of them. The front desk was very nice and helpful-that I agree with. However, the room left a lot to be desired. Noisy A/C, shabby carpet and uncomfortable bed. Balcony outside looked like it was ready to crumble (no chairs even if we'd wanted to sit out). Think this was a reconverted apt bldg. My husband called it a &quot;dump&quot;.The elevator situation is horrible-constant waiting for 2 tiny elevators. Breakfast was a fiasco. They'd run out of lots of items and I got down there when they still had 45 min to serve. Very noisy and crowded. I grabbed 2 boxes of cereal and milk and took to our room. We ended up stopping for coffee and a muffin.And yes the area is kind of seedy-lots of students living in big old homes converted to apts. with probably cheap rent. We did walk back from central downtown at night and didn't have any problems though. There are quite a few depanneurs (little groceries) in the area. We were supposed to stay for 5 nts and checked out after 1 night ."
31,1471,"Jul 13 2005	Residence Inn comfortable but overpriced	For $198 CSD/night, we got a standard suite (queen bed, sitting area, kitchen) and a view of the water, plus breakfast in the morning. The bed was comfy and everything was functional but overall the room and bathroom appeared quite used...would have suggested a price closer to $120/night for the level of amenity.Good walking distance from St Catherines and tons of noodle houses (it's a student area)."
32,1471,"Jul 9 2005	Wonderful place!	Our family traveled from Florida to Montreal for a week (end of June - early July) and stayed at the Marriott Westmount. As a family of four, we travel on a budget, not luxury, so perhaps someone used to the Ritz would not be impressed - but we were! As other reviewers have mentioned, the included breakfast was wonderful, but somewhat crowded. The manager herself was helping to move things along by tending the waffle makers on Saturday morning. In the suite, our kitchen was fully equipped to make and serve dinner for four - something we have rarely found in places claiming to be 'suites' with kitchens - and the housekeeping services include washing the dishes! There is also a free grocery shopping service. We didn't use it, since we wanted to see what was available in the local grocery for ourselves, but on a long-term stay it would have been nice. We were in Canada during a heat wave - 90 degrees and humid - and our a/c kept up just fine.We thought the place was very clean, our housekeeping staff was great, and we had plenty of room when the sofabed was folded. The rooms and lobby really look just like the photos on the website, so there were no 'surprises.' For families like us, who do loads of laundry even on vacation, the laundry room was sparkling clean and pleasantly decorated, and the clothes were actually fully dry at the end of a cycle! Buy your detergent, etc at the grocery though - even if you only use half of it, it is cheaper than the $2 a load in the dispensers.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. They had great advice about everything from where to get a pizza on Sunday night to the best viewing place for the Canada Day fireworks. Two things keep this from being an 'excellent' rating: the elevators and the location. There are only two small elevators in the building, which the staff and guests grumble about equally. Since we were on the 16th floor, stairs were not an option, and there was usually a very long wait. The location is not bad for getting around - we could walk or catch the Metro to anywhere we wanted - but it is not in one of the nicer neighborhoods. There were a lot of graffiti, weedy yards, and trash around that we did not see in some of the other more central neighborhoods. There were panhandlers and drunks on the streets in the evening - no trouble, but I wouldn't want to be walking alone. I guess people used to living in large cities wouldn't notice so much, but it was uncomfortable for us. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it and return there. It was a great value and very comfortable for family travel."
33,1471,"Jul 3 2005	DISAPPOINTED - SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE	$200 CAD for this suite hotel was a rip-off! I guess I can see why someone would consider this nce if they have never stayed in a suite hotel before or have had a bad experience in the past. I would only spend $100 CAD here. I have been a part of Tripadvisor for a while now but this is the first time I felt that I needed to speak out about this hotel so others are not mislead like I was.The picture gallery of all the picures I've found on the internet showed this hotel being really nice. Good thing about this hotel: nice lobby, free breakfast, free high speed internet if you have your own laptop. The parking is tight with columns dividing every space so you must be careful driving your car in. Good thing about parking is that there are elevators in the parking lot that goes straight up to your floor ONLY ON PARKING LEVELS 2 AND 5. The living room space is only the size of the sofabd. The linen is old, pillow case are washed but pilows are NOT and they smell. We open the balcony and there is water leaking from who knows where. If you have young children, becareful because there are spaces in the balcony---the walls of the balcony are not attached to each other. The washrooms are too tight for a suite and for the hallway, everyone can hear what you say in your suite! I've read on the internet that Old Montreal is about 30 mins walkign distance but the front desk says dont' walk it, take the subway because it is too far. So overall this hotel is not worth your money, go elsewhere ."
34,1471,"Jun 3 2005	It's not bad...	My husband and I traveled with a friend to Montreal and needed to find a suite with two separate rooms (hard to find in Montreal). So we found what we needed in this hotel. Two rooms, a shared bathroom, and a common area. The location was ok, near a Metro stop, convenience store, etc. The lobby was nice and modern. The staff was very helpful and the breakfasts were plentiful considering they were free. But the rooms themselves were bland and lifeless, the bare minimum, and not like what you would find at a Residence Inn in the states. So if you need the suites, go for it. But if you are traveling alone or with one other person, you might want to try to find something with more character."
35,1471,"Apr 19 2005	Decent Hotel Hospitable Good price	The four of us (two adults, two young children) stayed here for two nights in April 2005. In whole, it was an enjoyable experience. The hotel is very well located (right near the old Montreal forum and the Atwater metro, although about two Metro stops away from the major business and shopping attractions downtown) and we were able to find parking on the residential street where the hotel was situated. Be warned, however, that if you have an SUV or minivan and cannot find parking on the street, the hotel will direct you to a public parking lot about a block away as the hotel garage cannot accommodate any vehicle taller than 5 feet 6 inches. The lobby and breakfast area were trendier and more European by far than the Marriott Residences that we have stayed in the U.S. The breakfast was very good, with many healthy choices (and unhealthy ones too).The Penthouse pool was a little small, and the gym consisted of a number of treadmills and a few free weights. There is an excellent view from the penthouse floor where the gym and pool are located. The staff was very friendly and very hospitable. The price for the hotel was about $130.00 (Canadian) per night before tax, which included one master bedroom, a living room with a pull out couch, and full kitchen applicances. The hotel provided a nice crib for our under two year old with clean sheets, all put together for us, at no cost. The down side to this hotel is that the interior of the rooms seemed a little dingy, as do the floors where hotel rooms are located. The carpets look like they can use an upgrade and/or a good cleaning. However, the rooms themselves are kept clean, as are the sheets, towels, kitchen etc. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, however, to those looking for a romantic weekend away or for a sophisticated hotel experience, this is not the hotel you are looking for."
36,1471,"Feb 14 2005	Nice but not great	I have stayed here a few times. I was impressed by how fresh and hip the lobby and hallways were when I arrived, only to be somewaht underwhelmed by the rooms, which were previously apartments. The rooms were clean and fresh but were rather old and had undergone a &quot;soft&quot; renovation rather than a &quot;hard&quot; renovation prior to conversion into a hotel.  Parking under the hotel is handy, but limited overhead clearance is tough if you drive anything but a car. And, be sure to unload your bags on the street level, as it's a labyrinth of stairs getting the bags from the garage into the elevator.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and the breakfast above average."
37,1471,"Oct 14 2004	Nice not spectacular.	As other reviewers have said, nice but not spectacular. I spent one night here and it wasnot a bad choice. Rooms &amp; kitchens modern &amp;adequate if a little cramped. The 20th floor fitnesscenter &amp; pool were crisp ,clean &amp; enjoyable, as there is a great view from the outside terrase.The hotel is on a quiet, semi-residential street.Good access to Concordia, McGill &amp; la salleUNiversities. Lots of good takeout (or sitdown) restaruants. Plenty of small grocers (&quot;depanneurs&quot;) to fill your refrigerator. Double check if your room will havethe balcony promised. Staff is pretty friendly &amp;helpfull. Pretty good choice if you arestaying more than a few days &amp; are willing to walk a few blocks."
38,1471,"Sep 17 2004	Solid but dull.	Stayed here for 4 nights (Aug 04) and it is a solid suite based hotel. Upsides were 1) walkable to center of Montreal 2) balcony 3) friendly staff 4) breakfast was included 5) clean and presentable Downsides 1) no character whatsoever (realise it doesnt claim to have any) 2) no washer in room (was one in basement) and dated white goods 3) lift was incredibly slow and small (got the stairs more often that not) 3) breakfast was over subscribed as the opening times were too short 4) were next to the lift which while slow could be heard. Wouldnt stay here again, not because there is anything wrong with the hotel just because there is no reason to and Im sure your money could be better spent elsewhere."
39,1471,"May 11 2004	An excellent hotel	I stayed at the Residence in early May. It is a great hotel. The lobby, and public areas are very clean and appealing. The rooms are excellent, as well as the bathrooms. Even a kitchenette, if one desires to cook up something. An excellent buffet breakfast is included. The staff very nice and helpful. A huge shopping mall two blocks away, as well as a 22 screen movie complex, and a Metro stop. Could not have been a better place to stay for the price as far as I am concerned. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."
40,1471,"Mar 30 2004	thanks to Front desk staff	I just returned from a long stay in Montreal at Residence Inn Westmount. I did love the free grocery service provided with efficiency by the Front desk. I wish I could have the same at home. Room nicely decorated and comfortable. Not to mention the Lobby, very european. Breakfast is big and delicious. I do commend it."
41,1471,"Jan 6 2004	Nice Area But A Bit Removed	I spent three nights at the Residence Inn Marriott Mont Westmount (Jan 1-3). The hotel is situated on a nice quiet street (Lincoln) just below Sherbrooke. The room was okay but like many Montreal hotels is in need of renovations. I normally stay in the Latin Quartier or around Crescent St so being all the way down in the Atwater area was a bit inconvenient. The pluses are the AMC Forum is nearby so you can see great movies in a colossal theater and the Atwater Metro is right across from the Forum. The room had a great kitchen but the sleeping area needed sprucing up as did the bathroom but it was all clean. Also each room has a balcony. But the best part is the breakfast which is served daily and is included with your room rate. There were waffles, eggs, fruit, muffins, and numerous other items. Very economical. This hotel also charges a dollar for each outgoing call even local so that was a bit disconcerting but since I had made quite a few to friends, etc. Please note that all rooms that end in 6 or 7 are located right next to the elevator shaft so the constant droning can make you nuts. I was lucky that they had another room available on a lower floor which was much quieter. All in all not a bad place with a great staff and adequate rooms."

45,1471,Jun 4 2008 	Gut nicht mehr und nicht weniger!
1,1474,Nov 26 2009 	Basically said we were liers	Stayed here for 3 nights. They were building a new parking lot and i could hear them all hours of the night on the 14th floor. Also room was not clean second night as maid forgot to clean. Did get a discount at chek out after day manager basically called us liers. Spoke with GM manager :) Breakfast is like 10.00 or more!
2,1474,"Nov 10 2009 	Quiet comfortable rooms and the Hotel staff and management were helpful and kind with the loss of my iPod.	Stayed here for business travel - Friendly, helpful staff at front desk and restaurant. It was easy to get a good night's sleep because the bed/pillows are very comfortable and the rooms are quiet. Nice and clean with good location to freeways and subway station right next door. Decent pool and gym area for fitness.I am grateful for the helpful, honest and kind attitude of the hotel staff and management on how they handled my missing iPod. I reported it missing the day before I checked out and I concluded it must have happened during room cleaning, either taken or accidentally thrown out. The front desk management and, later, the hotel manager contacted me for more information and investigated the situation. They were understanding and empathetic about my loss and kind and generous in trying to recover and replace it. They said this was the first time for any kind of loss at this hotel."
3,1474,"Aug 19 2009 	Not what we expected!!!	My Mom and I just got back from a wonderful holiday driving to Prince Edward Island and back and I wanted to post some information about a few of the hotels we stayed in.This was a real disappointment! We were referred by the Quebec Tourism (which is a great free service!!!), this hotel is rated as a 4 star and their review said &quot;within minutes of the Casino&quot;. Well let me tell you...a very roundabout confusing trip, a very lucky turn and 15 minutes later we found it, but this hotel SHOULD offer a shuttle service between themselves and the Casino! If I had known how hard it was to get to this hotel and the distance from the Casino I would have chosen another hotel. It took me 3 tries to find the right turn off, the right side road and the right driveway...and that was using a GPS unit!!! You can't be an inexperienced driver to manoeuvre your way around Montreal!I can say that it was clean, the people were friendly, the beds were comfortable (the best I slept in the whole trip!), and that is where it stops! There was no fridge, a TV (but you cannot plug a portable DVD player / or game system into), and private bathroom, but very outdated, no breakfast (but there is a McDonald's around the corner)."
4,1474,"Aug 9 2009 	great hotel and location	updated and clean rooms, great pool and gym, friendly service, subway at doorstep takes you anywhere in Montreal. would stay there again."
5,1474,"Jul 28 2009 	OK experience with some negatives but it was cheap	$84 for a night through Travelocity. The hotel seemed OK from the website and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try for an overnight stay in Montreal. The front desk experience was OK, although I was sure that the Travelocity reservation mentioned a complementary continental breakfast but the front desk person said that they didn't have one. The room itself was quite worn and my wife said that the carpet was dirty. The ice machine down the hall had its front hanging on by its hinges and the dispenser was held together by what looked like caulking (probably some sort of adhesive but it certainly wasn't done with care). The pool was OK and a decent size but shallow. When leaving in the morning, they had the entrance to the front of the hotel blocked off to cars for some unknown reason so I had to circle around and re-enter through the pay parking lot (but I didn't have to pay; it was just a pain). If I had paid $120, I would have been very unhappy. At $84, I was OK. If I could have given it a 2.5 rating instead of 3, I would have. Would I recommend it to a friend, though? Not likely, although if they were very frugal, I might."
6,1474,"Jun 30 2009 	Beware construction nearby.	Very disapointed, even though I didn't have high expectations, given the price point. Stayed there for 3 nights at the end of June 2009, with the family. While the location seemed convenient, being right next to the subway station and the free parking. But there is extensive construction going on nearby, which starts at 8am even on Saturdays. So if you've had some late nights out, don't plan on sleeping in too much. It woke us up even though we were on the 12th floor and had the AC working. From the looks of it the construction might take quite awhile. The service was good though, they gave us a room with 1king-bed by mistake, when we called they were able to change our room for a 2queen-beds right away. Also the hotel looked shabby from the outside, rooms and sheets smelled musty even though they we're clean. Probably from the lack of ventilation fan in the bathroom. Won't be staying there on next visit."
7,1474,"May 27 2009 	Disappointed	My husband and I were really disappointed with this hotel. When we were driving up to it we thought our GPS had lead us astray. It's not near anything of interest. We found the rooms to be a little shabby (there were floor tiles duct taped together in the lobby and an unfixed hole in the ceiling of our bathroom). Yes, the free parking was nice, and the Metro station couldn't be any closer, but we found the Metro to be somewhat of an inconvenience. The places we wanted to go to all required a transfer, which meant waiting for two separate trains and having to navigate through Montreal's huge Metro stations (they're like mini airports, seriously). Plus, for the two of us to ride the Metro to the city and back twice probably would have cost us the same as if we'd paid for parking somewhere in the city, and we would have wasted a lot less time."
8,1474,"May 27 2009 	good location	Chose this hotel due to location next to a metro station.Hotel was clean and tidy, reception was always very helpful, no safe deposit boxes in rooms, but more than happy to sort one out at reception. Swimming pool and gym both very quiet, small but functional.Best tip, get yourself to Reubens for a fantastic lunch (deli sarnies etc) fabulous value for money.Ate in the hotel first night due to long flight, pizza and beer were ok, but probably twice the price of outside, but that's not unusual in hotels.All in all a good hotel for our purposes."
9,1474,"Feb 27 2009 	Very nice accomodations next to a metro station	We were very pleased with our room on the 9th floor. It was winter, and the convenience of the Metro station right next door was a prime reason we stayed there. Leave the front door and enter the Metro station, and the city is only minutes away. Free parking is a major plus."
10,1474,"Dec 30 2008 	pleasant location	Near an amusement park.Not in the the center city of Montreal but a simple metro to Montreal.Enjoy the breakfast at Tim Horton's in the metro station.They speak english here.I had a double, it was good."
11,1474,"Dec 9 2008 	no so good  too far from the city	I didnt like this hotel at all , it was far from the city . our room wasnt clean and was smelly . stay away!!"
12,1474,"Oct 14 2008 	Terrific place to stay	Everything about the Sandman was wonderful-clean, spacious rooms. Staff extremely helpful and reception desk English-speaking. Location next to metro station very convenient. (We never drove our car for the 3 days were were there.) We would recommend this hotel to anyone-great value for the money."
13,1474,"Sep 30 2008	Nice modern hote excellent rooms not the best location	This is a modern hotel, with good facilities- swiming pool, quality restuarant, and bar. Restaurant has above average price, service not great, but set meal worth trying. The rooms are above average size, clean and comfortable. The only let down is the location, it is a few subway stops out of the centre. We were with a tour group and got back from sight seeing very late most nights, which meant we either had to eat in the restuarant or get on the subway to find food, as there is only fast food available nearby. But if location is not an issue for you, then I would recommend this for the price."
14,1474,Sep 22 2008 	Sandman was great!	We went to Montreal for my boyfriends birthday and had a great experience at the Sandman. It's a beautiful hotel that is clean and convenient. A little less expensive than right in the city which was great! It was convenient having the subway right next door.
15,1474,"Sep 3 2008 	Great Value	We stayed in a Queen room (2 queens, tv, bathroom, no fridge) for $87 a night ($100 with tax) off of a web deal on expedia.The front desk was very helpful, and kind, printing out directions to anywhere we needed to go, and routing us through the subway system. It's a toss up - we stayed there b/c it was cheap, had free parking, and was rated high on tripadvisor (meaning it was clean, service was good, and there weren't any glaring objections to it. It even has a pool and gym). It was outside of the city though.To tell you the truth, many attractions were easier to get to by car, so it's not such a big deal in terms of getting to places, and with that you have the subway nextdoor. But you're not in the heart of the city at all, if that's important to you (please see the price we paid above to determine if it's important to you).The place was a steal for the price, for what it offered. It's a good hotel, yeah a little old, and not so so pretty on the outside, but absolutely fine on the inside and the amenitites were fine (as opposed to glamorous).Stay here if you're looking for comfort on a budget, and you don't mind being 15 min. from the city, and taking a subway (or as I call it, a language barrier)."
16,1474,"Aug 26 2008 	Good value	We found the Sandman to be a good value. The averaged-sized rooms are clean, but nothing to get excited about - just two beds, a standard bathroom, a fridge, and a desk. The pool was quite nice, and the exercise room was sufficient to get in a weightlifting and aerobic workout. The front desk and dining room staffs were very pleasant. The Sandman is somewhat in the middle of nowhere, but a subway entrance is right next door, making it easy to get into Montreal."
17,1474,Aug 12 2008 	Great hotel!	Stayed here with a large tour group. We were here the night of Canada day so we caught a train(right next door) to town to watch the celebrations and back again. The room was nice and clean and very big.Staff were friendly and it is easy to get around!
18,1474,"Jul 14 2008 	Great budget hotel for families	This was our 2nd stay and again it was good. The first time we found the level of the noise coming from the highway too high, so this time we requested a room on the metro side. Unfortunately, it was still noisy. We could hear other guests coming in and out of their room and the beep of the elevator.Overall, it is nice, a little old, but clean. I recommend it to families you want to visit Montral. The pool is CROWDED but nice."
19,1474,Jul 10 2008 	Good Hotel	Had an good stay when we visited Montreal in the long weekend. Very close to downtown and La Ronde.Washrooms did not have fan in there which make them stink all the time. The worst thing was that they have placed the coffee maker in the washroom.
20,1474,"Jul 9 2008 	Good value reasonable location	We asked for the CAA rate and stayed for $105 a night, a good rate for this hotel in July. This hotel is outside Montreal, but the metro station is immediately below the hotel which makes it an attractive place to stay outside the more expensive Montreal core area. The one factor to consider is the closing time for the metro and whether you will need to stay downtown Montreal past that time.Driving to the hotel location was relatively easy, as it is close to the Jacques-Cartier BridgeThe standard hotel room was clean, everything was in working order. We did not have any problem with our stay other than one burned out lamp. The ice machine on our floor was out of order, but everything else we encountered was fine. Average to above average hotel."
21,1474,"Jun 14 2008 	Sandman was superb!	Having read the reviews we decided on Sandman for our 4 night stay to visit Canadian Grand Prix. While these reviews accurately described the absolute comfort and cleanliness of the rooms and quality and variety of the meals, we were most pleasantly surprised with the nearness to the Metro Station for mainly access to all of Montreal by Metro but also quality of shops within the Metro station, especially the grocery shop where we could have quite happily bought 1st class food items from chill cabinet and lovely beers and wines from shelves and chillers. We spoke to other holidaymakers staying in downtown Montreal who were having problems with noise etc...we had none of this, plus we had views of the island and river, an excellent location which we could honestly recommend to everyone!"
22,1474,"May 27 2008 	Excellent overall value	We just spent a week's vacation in Montreal and were really glad we chose the Sandman. It's right across the street from the Longueuil Metro station, putting you only 2 stops away from the center of town. If you stay out after the Metro shuts down, the hotel is right over the river from Montreal, so the cab ride prices were reasonable.  The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and fluent in English. The room was clean and comfortable, but the beds may be a bit hard for some. When the bathroom light went out, maintenance was there within 15 min to fix it. The indoor pool was clean but shallow. There is a small fitness area with weight machines, 2 treadmills and 1 stationary bike.Overall, we were very pleased and will stay there again."
23,1474,"May 26 2008 	Excellent Hotel good value and close to Metro.	Excellent Hotel. Everything we wanted. Very clean, tidy, nice Bar, Restaurant area (had a nice breakfast buffet), good indoor Swimming Pool, Carpark (free) and well situated for the Tube to Montreal's city centre. We booked our room on the Internet, a few weeks earlier, with no problems. We flew in from England (UK) to Boston and drove over the USA/Canada border to Montreal. As we drove into Longueuil we had problems finding this Hotel. Perhaps we were getting tired after such a long journey or the map from The Sandman's Web Page was lacking detail, a bit of both I suspect, as we got lost a number of times in the surrounding Hotel's area. So if you're a lousy driver like us, get plenty of Maps of the area printed off first. This is just a minor moan/detail and hope it does not detract from the splendid Hotel. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly and helpful Reception Staff. The one Lady even helped me make an international phone call home to England using their public phones in the reception area. I failed miserably with all the Codes and Language barrier, but she took the time to sort out this problem and my connection was made. I've stayed at other Hotels and asked for similar help and they will not get involved....so, well done that lady! The Sandman Hotel was a good choice and would use (and recommend) this Hotel again on our next visit to Montreal."
24,1474,"Apr 10 2008 	Unbeatable Value!	Excellent location directly next door to Metro station. A quick 10-minute train ride to downtown. Free parking for hotel guests and accessibility to transit across the street made for easy travels all over Montreal downtown.Apart from the location, this hotel has AMAZING value! It might not be downtown, but it is quick and easy and almost half the price! We paid $100 CAD a night and similar 3.5 star hotels downtown were charging upwards of $160. Indoor pool and hot tub were great and breakfast buffet (although very busy) offers a great selection and price. Front desk staff helpful and courteous. Will return anytime!!"
25,1474,"Mar 9 2008 	Nice 3 star	We had a one-night stay, en-route to the States. The Staff at Reception are most helpful &amp; friendly. The hotel is clean. Rooms &amp; bathrooms adequate. Beds comfortable. Nice &amp; quiet on the Sunday night that we stayed. The pool &amp; sauna we had to ourselves on Monday morning. Location is excellent proximity to major highways. We would definitely consider Sandman Longueuil for a stop-over again. Excellent value for the money...we had booked on-line with Sandman's own web-page for $85 prepaid a couple of weeks in advance. Parking was free."
26,1474,"Jan 20 2008 	Nice hotel	I stayed three nights in Sandman-Longueuil. The rooms are nice and clean, there was a telephone and an RJ-45 plug for internet access in my room. The heater / air conditioner is a little bit too loud and starts and stops automatically. It is hard to adjust temperature, it does not maintain a set temperature very well, but otherwise the location is good and the price is very reasonable. Staff is friendly, corridors are clean, not too many people and it was pretty quiet. The best part about this hotel is that it is within 3 minutes walking distance to &quot;Longueuil&quot; Metro station. There isn't too many dining places within walking distance, though. There is free parking outside, which is nice, but no lunch was included in price. The bathroom is pretty clean, water is hot. It takes about 20 minutes to reach Downtown Montreal from this hotel, so I can say, it is conveniently located, even though it is on the other side of the river. It is pretty safe there, I believe, doors are good and are opened by magnetic swipe-cards. I definitely recommend this hotel, although it is not extremely romantic...."
27,1474,"Dec 31 2007 	Great Place to Stay!	I go to Montreal quite a bit with friends for long weekends. I have stayed in many hotels down town and have stayed a the Sandman 3-4 times. Overall, I think the sandman is the best value and place to stay. Many of the hotels right in the city are double the price and not as clean. The Sandman is very clean is is located right outside of a metro stop. We usually take the Metro into town for a night out and then get a taxi back to the hotel. The taxi usually costs about $20 canadian dollars. Even when I stay right in the city I end up taking a taxi at night so it is not that big of a deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Montreal!"
28,1474,"Dec 19 2007 	You Have to Consider this Hotel for your Montreal stay	This October, as the leaves are changing color in beautiful Montreal and Quebec, I stayed at this hotel for the second time...and I will keep coming back. (This was my 7th time in Montreal).The most compelling reason to stay here is the exceptional location that, while not in the Montreal city limits, is IMMEDIATELY across the important Jacques Cartier Bridge so Montreal is 5 minutes away by car or, if you want to use the Metro, the terminus on the &quot;South Shore&quot; is across the parking lot from the hotel and it will also have you at the main &quot;Berri-UQAM&quot; stop in 5 minutes.There are other reasons as well. This used to be a Radisson property so the standards are high in terms of creature comforts. Because it is in Longueuil, on the &quot;South Shore,&quot; the prices are much more competitive. The rooms are super comfortable with a sitting area adjacent to the floor-to-ceiling windows. From my sofa, I was able to sit, read the paper and look at the Jacques Cartier Bridge with Montreal's skyline behind it. The staff has real &quot;joie de vivre,&quot; that Quebecois exuberance that was so incredibly pleasant, exemplified by each staff member and in both visits. They were extremely enthusiastic about helping me and making sure I was satisfied with my requests or questions.Other bonuses: a free of charge business area and free parking for guests (try finding that in Centre-Ville Montreal !)...I did not partake in the food offerings as there was no breakfast included, but at $ 105 CDN, I can't complain given that I received 4-star accommodations. Also, the gym and pool always seemed so lonely that I chose not to use them and go to places in the area that were better attended.This hotel might be overlooked because it doesn't come up under Montreal or is under a special heading. I am a good sleuth and found it by seeing the Radisson sign (when it was a Radisson) next to the Metro Terminus complex as I was crossing the Jacques Cartier Bridge in my rental car several years back. I'm glad I took notice. I recommend it."
29,1474,"Oct 1 2007 	Sandman was great	I loved our stay at the Sandman. We would definitely stay again. Very friendly and helpful staff. Just mention that you would like internet and they give you a cable modem free of charge.The metro was very convenient and made everything very close. It was a little tricky getting from the airport to the metro. If you take a cab it will be expensive, the bus will work but make sure you get directions from someone, we used the info phone in the airport to get directions. Here is a very good write up on how to use the bus to get to the metro:[--]"
30,1474,Aug 21 2007	good value	excellent location - right next to metro station. very clean room. and we had a great view of Montreal from 17th floor room.
31,1474,"Aug 9 2007	Not impressed at all	Had an OK stay when we visited Montreal in the long weekend. Beddings were quite old. Washrooms did not have fan in there which make them stink all the time. The worst thing was that they have placed the coffee maker in the washroom. I will never stay in this hotel again. They say its 4 star but according to my experience, it barely makes upto 2 star. Had MUCH pleasant stay ay Novotel Aeroport."
32,1474,"Jul 13 2007	All you could ask for	Clean, average sized room. Clean pool and workout room. Internet access worked but was a bit weak. Very friendly and helpful staff. Book through Expedia and it will be cheaper than going through the hotel."
33,1474,"Jun 20 2007 	Above Average	Every year we stay at this hotel. I just found out about tripadvisor not all that long ago, so I decided to post a review this year. If you are going to Canada for Grand Prix weekend this hotel is excellent. The metro station is right outside of this hotel which makes it very conveinent. The staff is wonderful. They are always smiling and always helpful. The pool is a decent size and there is a nice sitting area outside of the pool. Grand Prix weekend the breakfast buffet is included in the cost and the food is GREAT! My fiance just loves it. It is one of his favorite parts of our stay there. The rooms are a decent size. They have king beds, sofas, beautiful views, nice tv's, ironing boards, hair dryers, closets, and even a mini fridge. We love this place."
34,1474,"Mar 22 2007 	It is a roof-over-your-head....	I will start with a good point... The hotel is nowhere near downtown, but it is directly beside the Metro. The Metro is very easy to use thank goodness, because a taxi ride from downtown to the hotel is approximately $20 CAD.The beds and bedding are not the finest, our tap in the washroom would not turn off unless you wriggled it and turned it upside down... The air conditioner near the window, when on, would blow at your head when sitting at the desk... helpful if you have forgotten your hairdryer...I was sharing 2 connecting rooms with my family (total of 7 of us), and there were no fans in the washrooms... yes, I can't believe there were no fans to whisk away the humidity of the shower, and other things which I will not write about... (i thought fans in washrooms were some sort of standard? maybe I am wrong) but I ended up fanning the room using our door to the hallway...The lighting in the washrooms made me look like a zombie, and there were many many problems with getting the in-room internet to work properly... some of my friends on the 8th floor couln't get theirs to work at all and had to use the business lounge near the lobby... And as for the elevators... They were so PAINFULLY slow that I ended up getting frustrated each and every time, and I just took the stairs instead, high-heeled-shoes or no...The ONLY redeeming quality were the 2 or 3 young and friendly staff. One young gentleman took it upon himself to seek out the only corkscrew in the whole hotel, which I think was kept in a safe somewhere... and he finally did find it, and helped me to open my bottle of wine that I could drown my miseries in...To me, this hotel was a roof-over-my-head, and lived up to it's 3-star rating. When returning to Montreal I will try a downtown location and hope for the best..."
35,1474,"Oct 17 2006 	Excellant Choice	This Hotel was excellent. From the minute we walked in the door, the bi-linguel staff could not help us enough. This is the first Hotel we have stayed in on this trip that has not had free internet in the room, but I would say that this is the best hotel we have stayed in so far, half way thru our 21 day tour. The room was well presented and clean, the desk staff were very helpful when asked the routine &quot;tourist&quot; questions, the restaurant staff were very pleasant and the food was excellent. The hotel is located accross the road from a subway station making the location very convenient as you can be in the centre of town in a few minutes. The internet is available in a business centre where you can use their computer or connect your own. Public phones are available in the foyer if you wish to avoid the $1.00 surcharge for all phone calls made from the room. The only bad point is the road noise that you can hear from the freeway and we were on the 16th level, but it certainly was not loud enough to bother us at night. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
36,1474,Oct 12 2006 	good buy	We stayed there for two nights and it was nice especially the the price we got online. Location is good you might take metro to go almost everywhere in town. The metro station is just across the road and actually the hotel parking lot is the metro parking!
37,1474,"Oct 11 2006 	Superb Sandman	Some bad reviews state &quot; i did not know they spoke french?&quot; Like me you should know montreal is populated mostly by french canadians, whom are very friendly and courteous. The Sandman Longueuil is a fantastic hotel, the room was spacious and modern. we was on the 12th Floor overlooking the st lawrence river &amp; olympic tower in Montreal. The only criticism I have about our room is that they did not provide us with any spoons to stir coffee/tea - all we had was plastic sticks ! The Hotel was literally next door to the metro station which was only 1 stop away from Montreal centre, now that's convienient ! I Parking is free at the Hotel and easy to get to from any direction on the interstate. I would definately stay here again."
38,1474,"Oct 11 2006 	Average Hotel but Good Price	Got a great price from Expedia for a three night stay however visitors should be aware that this is primarily a business hotel and also used by large coach parties.The Sandman is classed as a four star according to the name plate outside however I would definately put this as a three star for rooms and facilites which are bog standard Novotel style rooms which need updating. The staff however were cheerful and helpful.If I visited Montreal again I would definately pay a little extra to stay in the Old Town as the suburb of Longueuil, where the hotel is situated, is on the end of a branch line of the Metro so you have to travel to a hub station before going anywhere within the main city - saying that the Metro was clean and efficient."
39,1474,"Oct 5 2006 	Great stay at the Sandman	After a horrible day of driving and the realization that the attraction we had just driven six hours to visit [the nearby La Ronde amusement park] was CLOSED due to poor weather, we checked into the Sandman ready for some drying off and sleeping.The hotel has a great location, as has been pointed out in previous reviews. A METRO subway station is right outside, leading to downtown Montreal. Parking is free, as well, so the cost to get downtown is minimal. The proximity to La Ronde can't be beat, it's less than a five minute drive from La Ronde and Parc Jean Drapeau.We paid under $90 Canadian per night in late August, easily the cheapest three-star location that I came across in my searches. Location to restaurants leaves a bit to be desired [a large strip of restaurants is about a ten minute drive away], however the hotel does feature an in-house restaurant and bar, which we did not dine at. Prices are very high, however.Room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly. I'd definately recommend this location to anyone."
40,1474,"Oct 4 2006 	very helpful staff	Our first time to Montreal, and the staff couldn't have been more helful. Booked our tours, explained the metro, and gave excellent recommendations for good, reasonable restaurants. The Metro is right beside the hotel and very convenient. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel's restaurant.Had a very good dinner there late on a Saturday night.The hotel is maintained well. Only complaint; they could stock more English language papers in the lobby. Would use this hotel again."
41,1474,"Aug 30 2006 	Best value after all	My wife and I stayed there two nights in mid August, during a road trip USA-Canada-USA. I reserved my room in July through the hotel's website and catched a special offer at 99 CDN per night plus taxes. As far as I can remember, the offer also included the breakfast, however the confirmation e-mail just mentioned &quot;hot deal&quot; in the conditions. When we arrived at the hotel, we were assigned a spacious and clean double-bed room as expected, but we were told that the breakfast was excluded from the rate. When I tried to check back the website, some days after, the offer was no longer present on the website.Despite this inconvenience and the need fot some external renovations, I must award this hotel with the best price/quality ratio of all hotels we visited during our trip to Boston, Ottawa, Toronto, Niagara Falls, Geneva and New York.We were able to keep our car in the (complimentary) parking lot during all our stay and move with the subway, which is literally on the other side of the road and offers connections to the city centre and the &quot;Plateau&quot; neighborhood. We just used the car to visit Mont Royal and the Olympic Stadium.I would definitely recommend this hotel, unless you want to stay to a location very close to the city centre."
42,1474,Aug 27 2006 	not impressed	First of all be awere that Montreal is a mostly French spoken city.The Hotel we stayed at charged us $18CA for internett access. We stayed at 3 other Sandmans and it was free. Room does not have a fridge and is in need of a revamp. Bathroom was tiny could not close the door and use the toilet. The train station near by only had stairs and carrying cases made it very difficult
43,1474,"Aug 27 2006 	Great hotel	Stayed for 3 nights with 2 teenagers. Metro right next door (2 stops to Old Montreal). Comfortable, clean good sized rooms with great views - excellent price through expedia. Lovely, good sized pool and gym area. Very friendly, helpful staff. Free carpark. Great base to see Montreal."
44,1474,"Aug 22 2006 	A Solid and Affordable Hotel	My wife and I both agree that the Sandman is a great hotel for anyone who wants a decent hotel at a decent price, nearby Montreal.The staff was friendly. The hotel stuck by our reservation with no surprises. They bumped us up to a king sized room on arrival, instead of two queens. This gave us a comfy couch, coffe table, and plush chair to enjoy the view out the window. Our room was spotless. The bathroom was extremely clean with much room.It only takes you thirty seconds to walk from the hotel to the metro. In the metro building are some stores, fast food restaurants, and a small grocery story.Our only dissapointment was the breakfast buffet. Though it included pancakes, bacon, breads, cereal, and fruit - it seemed rather bland and not worth the money. If you can wait, go elsewhere for breakfast. Be warned, there are not many choices within the hotel vicinity to dine. Part of enjoying Montreal is choosing where you are going to eat. Hop on the metro, and within 15 minutes you can start your adventure."
45,1474,"Aug 19 2006	Good hotel GREAT VIEW - good value for money	Your standard room, King with a fold out couch. GREAT VIEW of Montreal. 100ft from the metro. Used metro and left car in lot. Parking was free. My son enjoyed the pool and exercise room. Very handy, McD's in the train station, and a grocery shop with sandwiches and the like. Stayed 2 nights, would use again."
46,1474,"Aug 8 2006	Great place for the money	This hotel was comfortable - just steps from the subway - easy to get in and out of the city. Taxi costs about $40 to the airport from the Sandman. Staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 16th floor with a view of Montreal. They have a pool and fitness room. They have free internet access available, a place to eat, also close to McCafe for those requiring that type of thing. All in all, I'd stay there again."

2,1485,"Aug 12 2009 	Great Location Clean Rooms Good Value	I stayed at the YWCA Hotel Montreal. (They run a hostel too). It's got a great location for visiting Downtown Montreal, and even Vieux Montreal, if you don't mind the walk (almost 30 min, but lots of sights). You can walk to a variety of different restaurants at night. The rooms are clean and basic, and service is good. There is a restaurant in the lobby (breakfast is not included). The rates are fantastic for a big city--and the proceeds support YWCA programs, so that is a nice bonus. It's a quiet hotel and they have lots of tourist information and can help with anything you ask. The restaurant for breakfast is okay. Oh, if you stay out past 11, they lock the doors and you have to ring a bell to get in, FYI. Great stay on a budget, in the heart of the city."
3,1485,"Sep 27 2008 	Good value	We stayed in this hotel in Montreal for one night. We had one of the cheap rooms with shared bathroom. The room was clean with a TV and air conditioning. It was comfortable but not attractive. We were happy with the room for the price. The one real problem is with the bathroom and shower facilities. There's no problem with this as far as the ladies are concerned, but for men things are much more grim. The men's bathroom is dark and dirty, and you should be prepared to wait for your turn almost every time you visit. The shower room is a little better, but it too gets messy quickly. Here's my top tip: if you get fed up with waiting for the bathroom (and, eventually, you will), there's another one on the ground floor. It's the only additional one I could find. Or even better: pay a little more and go for a room with a private bathroom! Or even better than that: forget about staying in a hotel and book into one of the many good B&amp;Bs in Montreal for the same price!"
4,1485,"May 10 2007	Exceeds my expectation	I stayed a couple of days in Hilton, Quebec City for business prior to traveling to Montreal. This was a side trip and I didn't want to spend too much money, so I booked the Y hotel with not much expectation since I paid about $60 per night only. It turned out to be a pleasant experience. The facility is old and cannot be compared to Hilton but the room is almost as spacious as the 4 star hotel I stayed previously. The kitchen facility is a great bonus even though I didn't really use it. My guest visitors were also very impressed when they came to visit me."
5,1485,"Jan 13 2007	Great budget hotel	I stayed at the Montreal Y hotel when I went to a conference in Monteal in June of 2006. I highly recommend this place to travellers who look for an inexpensive and decent place to stay. (I showed my student ID to the cashier, and got 10% off!) In general, the area is pretty safe. The location is central, close to tons of restaurants, bars, and shops. There's a metro stop a few blocks away. The room that I stayed had a private bath. It looks like that the hotel is recently rennovated. Everything looks new! Both the room and the bathroom were very cean and comfortable. (The room was very quie?.) There's a TV set in the room. Also an ice machine down the hall way. There are a microwave, pots, and pans in their kitchen (there's a supermarket just blocks away), where you could prepare your meals. The kitchen is clean and has lots of sun light. (Also free use of the YMCA gym)The only downside is that there's no wireless internet access inside the hotel."
1,1486,Nov 13 2009 	Great Location	I stayed here 3 nights on a personal visit. I booked it through Expedia. I paid AU$545.05 including taxes for the 3 nights. The location was exactly where I wanted to be which is the main reason I chose it. The entrance is a bit odd. From the street you go though doors and down half a flight of stairs. What you see from the street is a hair dressing salon. The entrance to the hotel lobby is to the right of the salon. The lobby is incrediably tacky
2,1486,"Oct 18 2009 	Don't even waist your money	ya the rooms are small I went with my husband and son the beds were comfortable but the service ahhh no ... you know what don't even waist your time at the time of check in we requested a queen size bed they didn't have it available we made the reservation a few days ago, so they gave us another room at no extra charge, but they wanted a $20 deposit incase you rent a movie... anyway yes the bathroom is small and they had running hot water, but when it was time to check out the receptionist said ya you get your $20.00 back they put it back in your account so my husband called the credit card company to see if they put back the money ... the receptionist lied so my husband went back and had to complain the receptionist gave us the run-around so on top of that they gave us the money back in cash... and the parking lot was across the street from the hotel ... so if i were you don't bother going to this hotel i hope you make the smart decision"
3,1486,"Sep 15 2009 	Location location location	Best Western Europa is located in the heart of downtown Montreal, close to lots of shopping, restaurants and of course the Bell Centre. If you are planning to get out and keep busy seeing the sights, this hotel is great. If you want a large luxurious room to spend a bunch of time in, you might want to choose another hotel.&gt;Rooms are very, very small. Not only the actual room but the bathroom is tiny as well. Relatively clean, although while we were getting ready to check out we found an old black banana peel. Elevators are also small. No issue with noise, we found the rooms to be quiet. &gt;Staff is polite, helpful when asked.&gt;Restaurant in lobby, Chez Cora serves breakfast and was good, but long lineups on weekends. As noted above, lots of restaurants within walking distance to choose from as well.For us, the price was reasonable and the location was superb. We don't spend a whole lot of time in the room on trips, so we would consider staying here again next time we visit. Metro station is also close by, so getting elsewhere in the city (Old Montreal, ect.) is very simple."
4,1486,"Sep 5 2009 	Tiny rooms tinier washrooms horrible service	I am not sure why this hotel has good reviews.Small smelly rooms. Tinier washroom. Horrible service.We checked into the hotel because I have stayed at other Best Western hotels and this is nothing like them. Compared to this Best Western, the other Best Western hotels were luxury hotels!!I am writing this review from the hotel room.Our room was so small only one of us could move in the little space between our bed and the TV.The washroom was so tiny that you would have to sit on the edge of the pot so that your knees don't bang against the wall.The exhaust in the washroom gave both of us a terrible headache. The washroom did not have sufficient toiletries for 2 people so I called the front desk. It took me more than 1 hour to have 1 extra towel, soap and shampoo sent up to the room. Basically - a very disappointing experience. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone."
5,1486,"Aug 27 2009 	Clean hotel good value	My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Ups: Clean, comfortable hotel. Good location, and close to both the green and orange subway lines. Great value!Downs: The location is convenient but we ended up trekking to other neighborhoods most of the time. The service is disappointing - staff was either unfriendly or inexperienced. Our single King room was right by the elevator and I heard all the people walking by. Maid service came at an alarming 830AM, waking us up way too early.Even with all the downsides, the hotel is a great value."
6,1486,"Aug 19 2009 	Great Location 	It's very true - the rooms are TINY. But they are clean, the shower has lots of hot water and it's 1/2 the rate of any other hotel downtown! So if you are enjoying Montreal and just in the room to sleep, you won't mind the small rooms.The location alone is fantastic right next to shops on St. Catharines St and a couple blocks away from the pubs on Crescent. Also only a 15min walk from old Montreal."
7,1486,"Jul 27 2009 	Good Location Run Down Hotel	We stayed at the Best Western Europa hotel on Drummond Street July 21-24, 2009. The hotel was in a great location right in the centre of everything. It was within walking distance to the Metro station, shopping and tourist attractions. The staff at the hotel went to great lengths to assist us in whatever we needed.My problem was with the room. We stayed in 412 and let me tell you, this room was very basic. The carpet is worn out and looks dirty. The air conditioner was really loud and every time the compresser went on and off it banged. This went on through the entire night. The bathroom has to win an award for the worst layout I have ever seen. The toilet is so close to the door, that when you are sitting, your knees are actually touching the bathroom door.The hotel restaurant has closed and a Cora's has opened up next door with a very limited menu. We went up to have a look at the spa area which opened up to replace the roof top pool. The floor were all cracking and there were actually holes in the walls. In my opinion this hotel is in serious need for some rennovations. The front lobby looks great but the rest of the hotel needs some work."
8,1486,"Jul 14 2009 	Nice but small ""Comfort Level"" rooms great location	Room was small but in great shape, price was great, awesome location, Cora restaurant in hotel only serves breakfast food. Would stay again for one overnight."
9,1486,"Jun 1 2009 	Nice Hotel - Fantastic Location	Came to Montreal for the weekend to visit some friends and booked into the Best Western Europa last minute. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived and the hotel has a nice up scale feel.The room was incredibly small and I could not imagine sharing it with another person but it was very clean and the bed was comfortable - I really didn't need any more than that. Plus it included free wireless internet which really came in handy. The restaurant in the lobby served a great breakfast but it's the location that makes this hotel a real winner.Just steps from St. Catherine Street, it is right in the middle of the shopping district during the day and the club district for nightly entertainment. There are fantastic restaurants of all kinds every where and many attractions and museums all with in walking distance. As well Old Montreal is only about a 15-20 min walk away. And considering the price I paid for the room, the Europa is a terrific deal! It was a great choice for me and I'll definitly stay here again next time I'm in town!"
10,1486,May 19 2009 	Good place to stay although nothing amazing	good location and relative good service. The room are in line with what we can expect from this chain.
11,1486,"Apr 30 2009 	OK	Good location, decent room. The staff were just okay. We booked a 3person room through AAA, however they gave us problems when we checked in. I didn't like how we were treated, which was too bad because I liked the bartender. He gave us more inside information than the staff and he certainly had more smiles! Parking was a bit off-site, but it is a city!"
12,1486,Feb 17 2009 	Small Room	Pretty clean hotel booked it to save some money after wish I had spent a little more. Was basically a bed in this tiny room hard to walk around the bed. One receptionist was great the other very rude (because I was anglo) If money is and issue then this is an okay option close to Bell Centre! Go Habs Go!
13,1486,"Feb 11 2009	Bad breakfast	Nice hotel and location, but the breakfast...If they call a very small glass of orange juice, a slice of bread and a glass of coffee breakfast..."
14,1486,"Dec 4 2008 	I was disappointed	We got a good deal so we booked this hotel. When we arrived, we found out that the pool was closed for repair and that the higher floors were also closed for repairs due to the fact that the hotel was not busy. The room we were first given was tiny and one of the lamps had no bulb in it. The worst part was the location. It faced a court yard where if people were outside they would literally be able to look right into the room. After complaining, we were offered another room which was only slightly better. We finally decided to pay a little more for a king-sized room. This room was much larger and the bed was great, although the room could have been decorated a little nicer. We were two people but were only supplied with one bar of soap so we asked at the front desk for more soap. We went out and were told that it would be brought up to our room. This never happened. We had to request it a second time. We discovered late at night that the shower drain was not working properly which meant that the bathtub would fill up rapidly while taking a shower. When we mentioned this to the front desk at checkout the next morning, requesting some compensation for the lack of good facilities, we were told that we should have called for someone to come up and fix the shower or ask to be moved to another room. Given that it was late by the time we took our showers and that we had already moved rooms, we were too tired to do that. The person at the front desk was not very friendly and did not offer any kind of apology or compensation."
15,1486,Nov 4 2008 	okay- good location	hotel was in good location right in the main part of city .lobby was very weird and abit off putting - large weird statue in fountain ?? odd very odd !!room was fine nice and comfy and big enough just standard 3 star hotel room .. staff were not that friendly .. cheap good breakfast downstairs .. we got very cheap price i would not pay too much for this.. wasn't bad just try something else .. unless you get it very cheap ..
16,1486,"Oct 15 2008 	Great Location	We really enjoyed our stay here at the Best Western Europa. It was centrally located and very close to the VIA station for you train riders.If you like the 'clubbing' area, and brand name shops; then this place is for you. If you like the Europe feel and want to venture over to Old Montreal its about a 15-20min walk. There is also Saint Laurent, and that is about a 10-15min walk away. Really great places. Really nice hotel. Also very affordable for the location.Thanks!"
17,1486,"Oct 3 2008 	Great Location For Nightlife	This hotel is on the corner of Rue Drummond and St. Catherine Ouest, only 3 blocks from Rue Crescent where there are great restaurants and bars including Grumpy's, The Hard Rock, and Saturday's. The staff is very friendly at the front desk. There's an ATM right in the lobby for &quot;re-fueling&quot; stops. Parking is right across the street, but I have experienced vandalism in the lot, so you might want to look for alternative parking. The rooms are fairly small with a definite &quot;European&quot; feel right down to the narrow hallways. But everything was very clean.There's a &quot;pool&quot; on one of the higher floors but I found it very small. Fortunately I think I'm the only one who knows it's there, as I've never seen anyone else in it.I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveller who wants a home base for the &quot;St. Catherine's Scene&quot;."
18,1486,"Sep 4 2008 	Hardly worth the cheaper rate	Why so bad...Bathroom in lobby contained several non-flushing toilets filled with feces. Lobby was decorated strangely, looked like the inside of a swimming pool. Hotel room so tiny that a bed and dresser wouldn't fit in it. Dresser drawers could only be opened half-way and one had to squeeze around furniture items.Understaffed at front desk (takes half an hour to speak with anyone at front desk) This is typical of all Best Westerns. Also we overheard staff being argumentative/disrespectful with customers.Did not get a wink of sleep since ice machine was loud, used all night long and could be clearly heard outside thin hotel room door.Pair of leather boots we accidentally left in hotel room had mysteriously vanished when we tried to collect them 3 days later. (Hotel staff member gains new pair of boots?)Why did we choose it?Because we got a good rate for it from Booking.com ($99.00 CAD ). Best Western is smart enough to know that they wouldn't get customers otherwise.Worth it? Probably not."
19,1486,"Sep 1 2008 	Great Hotel at a Terrific Location	I have stayed at this hotel three times over the past 10 years, and each time I have come back primarily because of this hotel's terrific location. All rooms I have had were quite decent, only one of them was on the small side. Service has overall been good, only once I came across an uncooperative front desk person. Overall, though, I would definitely come back to this hotel."
20,1486,"Aug 12 2008 	Just dandy	I booked the Europa as part of a reasonably priced airfare + hotel package. Based on prior reviews I wasn't expecting much from the Europa. The place isn't fancy and the lobby area looks a little dated, but that's a really about the only flaw I found, a ver minor one at that. I was surprised to get a spotlessly clean, spacious, modern room. It looked like it had just been remodeled and refurnished the day before. Everything in the room worked perfectly, including the air conditioning and the free wireless internet (both of those are always a hit-or-miss propositions). I didn't have many occasions to request assistance from the staff but the few times I did everything was chop-chop (that's a good thing). Also, the location was perfect for my needs. I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing basic but comfortable accommodations in downtown Montreal."
21,1486,"Jul 5 2008 	Small rooms	We had a four night stay at this hotel recently. The room that we were checked into was very small, with little room in which to store luggage. The corridors are also narrow, adding to the claustrophobic feeling. The location is handy, with the metro and many shopping areas just a short stroll away. Unfortunately for us, there were inconsiderate guests staying and we were woken at 3am. I would not recommend the hotel for long stays."
22,1486,"Jun 29 2008 	Great Location Good Price	I made a last minute decision to visit Montreal and had a difficult time finding an affordable hotel that was in a great location with great reviews. I found it at Best Western. You can walk to Crescent St. where all the bars and clubs are at, plus it's a block away from Rue St. Catherine. If you want to visit St. Laurent Blvd. or Old Montreal, take a cab or the Metro. The staff was friendly and helpful, the place was clean and my room was quiet. The room is smaller than your standard American hotel, but if you're in Montreal, you shouldn't be spending much time in your room. I would definitely recommend this place."
23,1486,"Jun 27 2008 	It is a good hotel in a great location!	It is a good hotel in a great location! Steps to shopping, museums and attractions.Try Spa Orange, located at the 6th floor. It is a must foe every spa traveler; an full service spa with great amenities and many services. We tried sabai stone massageasia couple, and it was paradise."
24,1486,"Jun 26 2008 	You get what you pay for at this hotel	My room seemed to be a closet converted into a room. Very small. For instance when sitting on the toilet my knees were mushed into the bathtub. I am not sure if all rooms are the same but I found this amusing.The hotel is a great location - very close to the Bell Centre and St Catherine's street. It is very close to the Metro as well. It is also next door to a fire station so at points in the night you will hear sirens. Because of the close proximity to St Catherine's Street the hotel got pretty noisy on Friday night when some people enjoying the nightlife came back to their room.I would say this could be a great affordable hotel for some, and a below average hotel for others - it all depends on if you are in Montreal to go out and adventure or not."
25,1486,"May 29 2008 	loved this hotel	I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel , I was there during the easter weekend, the staff was great, the rooms were extremely clean, it was closed to my meetings. i will visit again with my family."
26,1486,"May 1 2008 	Great Location	I booked 3 rooms in this hotel for a family trip to Montreal. We stayed there 2 nights and overall I'm happy with the decision to choose this hotel. The hotel structure is old but in good condition and present great value for the money.The best thing about this hotel is the location. If you plan to spend time in downtown Montreal there is no better place. You are just off rue Sainte-Catherine (St. Catherine Street) - Montreal 5th Ave. and all major shopping and entertainment attractions.The rooms we stayed at were clean and tidy. Check-in and check-out was quick and staff was friendly upon requests for extra towels.The hotel has an adjacent restaurant, where we had breakfast, we didn't use the hotel Bar and Restaurant, as I'm sure the options around were much better.On the downside I have to mention that the mattress and pillow were not very comfortable in all rooms (226, 227, 229 - all double beds rooms) and the drainage of the bath was very slow. TVs are small and picture in some channels was grainy, no special kids channels, only in the morning.I would certainly recommend this hotel for the budgeted traveller who can compromise some in-room pleasure for the great location and cost."
27,1486,Mar 20 2008 	Great Location	This hotel is in a perfect location if you are planning on hitting up shopping on St. Catherine Street and the Bars/Clubs on Cresent. My room (204) had two double beds and was rather large. My friends were in 206 and it was slightly smaller but still a decent size. My room was at the end of a hallway so not too noisy. The service at the front desk was friendly and helpful.
28,1486,"Feb 28 2008 	Good hotel great location	The hotel is located about 15 minutes (in taxi) from the airport. The staff was great, the hotel rooms were a good size for 2 people. Very clean rooms, nice views. We went to see our Atlanta Thrashers play the Canadians at Centre Bell and it was a block from the hotel which was perfect. The hotel lobby was decorated very nice also. Great choice!"
29,1486,Dec 19 2007 	Great location....	The hotel had a great location. We parked the car when we arrived and walked around to the places we needed to go. We parked in a lot across the street for $20 per day. St. Catherine Street is the next street up and there was a lot of places to shop and eat. We were a little taken back by the size of our king size room. The area that the bed was in was very small. We considered asking to upgrade to a larger room. The bathroom was large and the mirror was big enough for two people to use at the same time. The restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch had very poor service. Our waitress basically disappeared and we had to ask another waitress for our check. The food that we chose was not good (awful crepes). We used the hotel website and prepaid online so it was only 99.00 plus taxes so for that price it was reasonable. We are going to Montreal again in March and I have already booked a different hotel.
30,1486,"Nov 29 2007	Bettern than the typical Best Western in the US	ROOM:We had a queen bedroom at the end of the hallwayand the room was super small!!I've never stayed at the such a small hotel room before.But it was quite clean and furnitures were good. Definately not the cheap kind. I loved the beddings as well. Mattress was firm andsheets were clean.The room did have a coffee maker and condiments, and 2 mugs. They prodvided a free wireless internet service, but you need to get the access code from the front desk.Bathroom was clean and nice.LOCATION:Awesome location! It's in the middle of the downtown shopping area and the Metro(subway) is only 2-3 blocks away.There also is a hair salon and and Cora restaurant for breakfast &amp; dinner on the lobby. We had a breakfast at the Cora, and it was very satisfying. I highly recommend!!They do have a fitness center along with their new Spa facility.PARKING:There is a public, paid parking lot across from the hotel andit was $20 for 24hours. It's an outdoor parking, but it was safe enough.GETTING AROUND:After getting some informations from the front desk(they are very helpful), we immediately went out to take the Metro to get to the Old City. Metro was $2.75 per person, one way. We had to transfer to another train after 3 stops, but it was very easy to transfer once you follow the signs. I think it took us less than 20min to get to the old city area by Metro. It was a good experience.SHOPPING:When I asked the front desk staff the hours for the undergroundshopping, he said 9am-9pm. But I guess that was only during the weekdays?? We were there on saturday and all the shops were closed by 6pm. That was very disappointing."
31,1486,"Nov 5 2007 	great service but terrible smoking problem	I stayed at the Best Western Europa for a dance seminar and show. We were there for two nights. The hotel has a beautiful lobby, with several restaurants. Chez Cora is a breakfast lunch place that is quite good with good service. Therew as also a Chinese restaurant and the Oasis cafe. The included breakfast was no longer included or served, starting with the weekend we arrived they no longer do a continental breakfast. This was a surprise as their website indicated that they did have one.The room was not too small. It had two double beds, no view, and a reasonable bathroom. The bathroom amenities were average for this type of hotel. There were plenty of towels and pillows and the room was the right temperature.We did have a problem that the room was quite smelly. We had requested a non-smoking room but it was clear that people had been smoking in our room in the past. Across the hall, two men were smoking all night in their non-smoking room. When they opened the door, it set off the fire alarm, waking us all up at 5am. When I got home, my spouse asked if I had been with a smoker as my clothing smelled. The stuffed animal I brought with me also had obtained a disgusting aroma. I know that cigarettes and Montreal are like New York and bagels, but it is unfair to make a room non-smoking and then have it not be. My friend is allergic to cigarette smoke and she started to develop a rash.The services at the hotel for our event were quite good. The food was good at the buffet. I enjoyed buying drinks from their extremely hot bartender, with his adorable ponytail. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and welcoming."
32,1486,"Nov 4 2007 	Comfy 	My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at this hotel (we booked it thru Bonjour Quebec, an extremely helpful website!) and we were very happy with the room, location and staff.The bathroom is very small but spotless...we were walking distance to restaurants, shopping and Mont Royal and easily took the Metro to other attractions... the staff was very friendly and helpful. The Restaurant inside the hotel (Chez ?) served the best breakfast we've ever had at a ridiculous low price! If you don't intend on spending alot of time in your room (because it isn't roomy) I highly recommend this hotel. :)"
33,1486,"Oct 9 2007	Great little hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights on the Thanksgiving (CDN) long weekend, and have nothing but good things to say about it. Our first trip to Montral, so we ended up asking hotel staff for directions numerous times; they couldn't have been more helpful. On their website, they advertise a pool/gym/hottub, but we didn't find any of them in the hotel; not a deal breaker though as we weren't in town to visit the hotel.Yes, the &quot;theme&quot; is a little 20000 Leagues Under The Sea-ish, but the hotel bar has a very nice vibe to it (captain's quarters it seemed) for a quick drink. There's a nice breakfast restaurant attached which was a late discovery on our part; definitely head there if you want to treat yourself to a good breakfast.Location couldn't be better; literally a 10 second walk from Rue St-Catherine, and under 5 mins from Rue Crescent.....as we walked around we looked for similarly priced hotels with as good a location; maybe there are some but we couldn't find any.Rooms are small, but we didn't find it a problem; bathrooms are tight, and the toilet can get even tighter. We would definitely go back, if not for the location, then for the friendly service of the hotel staff. I see a lot of the negative reviews were written a number of years ago; maybe there was a management change, but we didn't encounter any &quot;rude&quot; employees..even the cleaning staff was very pleasant when we'd run into them in the halls.We would recommend it."
34,1486,"Sep 30 2007 	Would stay again	If you plan to be out and about and are only staying a night or 2, this place is great. Location is excellent - just a half block away from Rue St. Catherine for plenty of shops, great eateries, and entertainment. The Old Port is about a 20 minute walk away. The rooms are definitely small so keep that in mind if you're staying a little longer, and there are so many great restaurants and cafes nearby that I wouldn't bother booking with breakfast included."
35,1486,"Aug 16 2007 	Wouldn't Recommend Staying Here Stay Elsewhere!	Well, for starters I booked my reservation for four people but, along with the confirmation from the Best Western sent to my email it said that I could change the reservation anytime before Thursday August 9, 2007. I did that at the end of July 2007 seeing that one of the four people couldn't attend do to personal circumstances. Instead of keeping the two rooms I thought that I changed it to one room instead of the two rooms. I guess that once you book a room with the Best Western at the 800# you can't change the reservation that it says you can in your email to confirm the reservation (so many days in advance). Totally disgusted by that part. Well, we arrived on Friday August 10, 2007 and they didn't have the one room that I thought was changed. They had the two rooms instead, the original reservation for $119.00 a night, at a total rate of $418.98 a piece. I was totally dissatisfied from my arrival. The rooms are on the very small side and if someone is walking around the bed from the window where the desk is someone had better sit down to let the person go by, because there just isn't enough room for two people to go by each other at all. Dissatisfied! The parking for the Best Western is across the street for $20 a day in a open parking lot (I checked on my car the entire time because nobody was at the lot watching the cars). Especially when they aren't responsible for what happens to your vehicle. Then on Friday August 10, 2007 (sometime after our arrival) we were sent a notice under both of our doors that we would be getting the breakfast in the morning from 6:30am-11:00am for the following morning. Well, when we got there on Saturday August 11, 2007 we were told that we didn't pay for the breakfast with the room. How much does a person have to pay extra to get a complientary breakfast in Montreal with the room? In the United States it comes with the room last time I checked in the area that I live in and a much nicer breakfast from what I was told by my daughter. What I saw at the breakfast wasn't something that I would ever pay for while traveling in my life. We all were disgusted by this and we moved to a wonderful place Chez Cora on Rue Stanley were they serve wonderful breakfast at wonderful prices. If you go try the strawberry/banana smoothie as it comes with a strawberry and grapes for $3.25. We ate there every morning during our stay. Sunday August 12, 2007 we started having a problem with our toilet in one of the rooms as it wouldn't flush. It didn't flush the rest of the time while we were there. Also, during the whole stay we all had a hard time getting water to flow alot and didn't have much hot water so to speak of, totally disgusted with the room and the price that I paid. When I checked out the Best Western Downtown Europa online at the beginning of the year 2007 I thought that they had a pool, they don't have a pool at all. Would of liked to have a pool after walking around seeing the sights all day while we were there. I guess they only have a fitness center and spa. After all the walking that you do why do you need to go to the fitness center at the Best Western? I wouldn't recommend staying here in Downtown Montreal try staying some place else instead."
36,1486,"Jul 17 2007 	what a disappointment!	I've stayed at numerous BW hotels across the USA and I would have to rate the Europa in Montreal as one of the worst BW hotel that I've ever stayed in. Its true, the rooms(and bathroom) are small but they are clean. The elevators take a very long time during checkout in the morning and are so small that its hard to fit two people including luggage. The photos on the the hotel website are very misleading but the worst part of my stay was the &quot;continental breakfast&quot; that was included in the rather expensive price of the room. I arrived at 10:00am for the breakfast which is served from 6:30am - 11:00am. The so called &quot;breakfast&quot; was dismal to say the least. There was only one bagel left and hardly any other food at all! I watched as a few other guests arrived after me looking for food and they looked as disappointed as I did! The hotel was filled with students partying all night long as if it was spring break. For the same price, I can't imagine anyone would stay here rather than one of the other hotels on Sherbrooke like the Marriott!"
37,1486,"Jul 16 2007 	Great Place Location Price Service	The hotel lobby is very uniquely designed, the staff were extremely nice and helpful. Rooms are clean with new furniture.Room was cleaned every day, towels changed etc. - very happy.Location is fantastic - right on St. Catharines close to Place des Arts and all sorts of shops, restaurants and entertainment, very close to Peel subway station. Fantastic restaurants in the vicinity!Checking out was also a pleasure - could safely store our luggage and go for a walk. Also, on a budget esp. during jazz festival time when everything was overbooked and overpriced!Would recomment and definitely come back!!"
38,1486,"Jun 18 2007	Good location 	We stayed at the hotel as part of a room block for a wedding from June 14 - 17. I had read some of the reviews and had some concerns about the size of the rooms, location and customer service. We had a room with 2 double beds on the 2nd floor (214). The parents we were traveling with had a queen bed room also on the 2nd floor (211). Their bathroom was plenty big but I'm not sure if it's because I requested a bigger one. The reservationist indicated some were bigger. The bathroom in our room with 2 double beds was plenty big enough as well. Pros:- Location was fantastic- Breakfast available- Free passes to Nautilus Plus gym (around corner on St. Catherine) since their gym is renovating -- Nautilus is an amazing gym so it worked out better- Gave us several options for where to park - parked in lot directly across from hotel which turned out to be fine (safe)- Rooms clean and AC unit worked- Good price (ours was a little discounted b/c of wedding block but not much)- Big closet in double beds roomCons:- Had to ask for extar towels a couple times- Vending machines kept running out of water- Room service is only an Asian restaurant- Kept running out of items and having to ask to refill them at breakfast (i.e. milk, fruit bowl, etc)Overall this hotel worked out well for us and we'd stay there again. The front desk also told me they are renovating their spa, gym facilities and sauna into this large spa for those coming in the future (after Sept 2007)."
39,1486,Jun 12 2007 	Best value in the city	We stayed at this hotel about 2 years ago and werent to impressed. We decided after shopping around to stay again because their price was good and the location is amazing. The hotel has since renovated and most lily gone through different managment becasue this place was soooo muich better this time. The new rooms are much nicer and well allocated and the bar and public areas are really well kept and presented. Their hotel bar is beautiful and the staff durin our whole trip was absolutly great and helpt us with a few problems which we had very well. WOULD DEFINETLY STAY AGAIN!. BEST LOCATION!!
40,1486,"May 29 2007 	Great Location	We stayed here from May 23 to 28. We picked it for it's location. And it is a great location. Very central and easy to get to either Metro lines. Good Points: good location, good continental breakfast at good price, staff was very pleasant. Very good internet connections and free.Bad Points: tinest room I have ever been in, the washroom was so tiny that when you sat on toilet you had to sit sideways or your knees would hit tub, about 3 inch clearance between the two. No place to put toilitries in bathroom. Bed was so hard I felt I was back in Mexico, would wake up throughout night with sore side. Air Conditioner was so noisy it would wake us whenever it kicked in. Bedding -- there is a duvet but this hotel uses a sheet on the bottom and a sheet on top, hopefully they clean the duvet regularily. Note: when we originally booked it stated on website and others that this was entirely non smooking, but this is not the case. Pool and jacquzi are closed for renovations until Sept."
41,1486,"Apr 15 2007	Worst North American room ever	This hotel had the worst room I have ever seen in a North American hotel: dark, tiny, and overpriced, even in Canadian dollars. I've occasionally seen rooms this small in Europe, but never before or since in Canada or the U.S. You could barely move in the bathroom. The monstrous air conditioner actually touched the bed. There was about six inches of space between the TV and the foot of the bed."
42,1486,"Mar 13 2007 	bad jacuzi no steam room broken sauna	My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a night out in Montreal and to relax. The room was clean. The manager/head desk person was kinda sleezy and recomended a horrible restaurant (The Angus Steak House) next door for dinner and proceeded to try and sell us on other places to eat that sounded just as bad. The &quot;jacuzi/pool&quot; had about 6 jets and was about 15' by 6' - their picture is deceiving. The sauna was not working and there is NO steamroom! Their security person made us uncomfortable, he came up to the sixth floor where the &quot;jacuzi&quot; is three times in the 20 min. we were in there."
43,1486,"Feb 28 2007 	Great Stay on a Budget	My mother and I recently spent a weekend doing some shopping in Montreal, and booked at the Best Western Europa because we had a gift card from Best Western.We were a little worried, having read some negative reviews, and another Best Western in the city told us the hotel was terrible. We loved it. We had requested a non-smoking room, and one that had been recently renovated. We checked in early, our requested room was ready, and very nice. Great fixtures in the little, brand new bathroom, and a very comfy bed.The best part of our stay was their oversized indoor jacuzzi, where we had a great long 'soak' after a long day of walking around the shops. The hotel is only about a block from St Catherine Street - you really can't find a better location to access the shops. We were not looking for anything fancy, just a comfortable place to sleep, and it met our needs perfectly."
44,1486,"Jul 21 2006 	Close to (almost) everything	My wife &amp; I have traveled from North-east U.S. &amp; stayed here numerous times over the last 6 years. I agree with most of the comments from previous reviewers, however no one mentioned how close the Metro (subway) is to The Europa. It is only a 3 minute walk &amp; will let you off within a 10 minute stroll to Olde Montreal &amp; Port area.The surrounding hotel area will cater to almost every vice &amp; craving with shops, cigars, coffee, desserts , nightclubs &amp; yes, gents, even adult entertainment. Yes, the parking is a bit steep (&amp; made worse by the cranky old coot in the booth ) but it is close to the hotel. The small coffee shop in the lobby will make a tastier &amp; stronger cup than your room coffee maker. Now if they could only fit more than 3 in the elevator......"
45,1486,"Jul 3 2006	Perfect for the budget-minded and location!	When searching for a good place to stay, centrally located and also a prime spot for the budget-minded person, don't look past the Best Western Europa in downtown Montreal. This was the second time I have stayed here and I will say that I wasn't disappointed. We paid under $100 (U.S.) per night for the room and it was everything I expected. I didn't go in expecting the Ritz Carlton and was quite happy with everything. I have added photos of our room to this review. I, unfortunately, forgot to take pictures of the parking lot and the outside of the hotel. I had planned to take those shots, but forgot. Before getting to my pros and cons, I'll go through a couple of things. The desk people and housekeeping staff were considerate and friendly. They were also very helpful when needed and always welcomed you when coming back into the hotel. The interior is interesting and clean. I didn't check out any of the restaurants or bar in the hotel -- or any other the other hotel amenities -- so I can't comment on those.I have pretty easy standards when it comes to hotels and traveling: price, cleanliness, location and safety. I'm not looking for all the bells and whistles some people look for when traveling. Taking all those into consideration, the Best Western was a great place to be at. So first, I'll go to the pros. PROS- The room was extremely clean when we first arrived. Each day the room was cleaned and shaped up. The staff was quick and courteous when dealing with this. - The beds were comfortable and there were more than enough sheets and pillows on each bed (we had a double room). - The TV was decent sized (25-27 inch or so) and worked well. We didn't use it much, but it was nice to have when needed. - Free wireless Internet access. Very easy to connect to and quite speedy. It was nice to be able to check my email and not have to dial up somewhere. - The water in the shower was powerful enough for me. I like it when there is actually water pressure. In this situation, I wasn't disappointed. - The location for the hotel is perfect. Situated on Drummond, you are steps from St. Catharine St., and two blocks from Crescent St. The whole area is perfect. It's also a very safe area. - In regard to safety, the hotel has a system set up where you have to use your key card to enter the hotel after a certain time as well as needing said card to access the elevator after a certain time. In five nights in Montreal, I also never had any problems with my key cards. - I can't reiterate how nice and helpful the staff was. We didn't utilize them often, but with checking in, checking out and the few questions we asked, they were always professional and smiling. You can't ask for much more than that. - Just a couple blocks from a metro station (Peel), which is even better.MIDDLE GROUND (Not a con for me, but might be for others).- Room size. It's small, so don't let anyone kid you differently. You can see in my photos that the room is tight. But it's to be expected. I've stayed in probably 8-9 different hotels in my travels to Montreal and not many have huge rooms. Not in this price range, anyway. For two people traveling and probably even three -- this wouldn't be bad. We had a king room a couple years ago and had 4-5 people and it wasn't bad. But the double we were in isn't made for many more than 2-3 people. I could see where a family would have a hard time with it. But, if you don't expect to spend much time there, it's not bad.- Parking. The lot is across the street and independently owned. It's $20 (Can) per night. They jam a lot of cars in the lot. There is also a parking lot about 3 buildings down from the hotel. These lots are a little shabby, but did the job for me. There always seemed to be someone on duty, which was nice. My car was perfect when we left and nothing had happened. Seemed fine to me, but I know a lot of people are worried about the lot. - The air conditioner. This kind of goes as a pro and con for me. The pro part was that it worked well. The con part is when you put the shade over the window at the night, it kind of covered it, so by morning, the AC wasn't flowing as well and it was warmer in the room. - Elevators. There are two of them and they are each pretty small. Didn't bother me because we were never trying to cram in with a ton of others, but I could see where if people were staying longer and had a lot more luggage, it could be hard to use these. CONSThe only reason I couldn't give the hotel a 5-star rating was that there were a couple things I would consider cons. Now mind you, I gave this place a 4, but it was actually like a 4.5. - Bathroom size. I like a bigger bathroom. I hate having to feel cramped when I'm getting out of the shower. I felt that way here. I was out of the shower and right in front of the toilet and sink. It was too crammed for my liking. - Windows. There was one window in the main room and one in the bathroom (although the glass they used for the one in the bathroom wouldn't allow you to look out, it was more to allow light in). The window wasn't too big and it was partially taken up by the AC unit. I just like natural light, so an extra or bigger window would have been nice. - Electric outlets. There weren't enough of them near the chairs/table, allowing two people to plug laptops in, as well as keeping a lamp and the TV plugged in. They were too spread out and in spots where they were only good for like charging camera batteries or a cell phone. Wasn't too bad, but could be a little annoying.OVERVIEWThe positives of this hotel far outweighed the negatives. While we had some cons with our stay, they weren't enough to make us sour on the hotel. It was a pleasant stay and well worth the money. We stayed for five nights and each was fine. Checking in and checking out were both easy and painless. The room was ready when we arrived and everyone was friendly. I'd stay here again and would highly recommend others to stay here."
46,1486,"Jun 20 2006	POOR FACILITIES AND SHABBY ROOMS	This hotel is well situated for the underground and is a safe area. I had no worries about walking around at nighttime.However the rooms are shabby and in need of a complete overhaul.We had 3 rooms on 3 seperate floors for our various family and all 3 were shabby, dimly lit, chipped furniture, stained carpets, torn or loose wallpaper and paint and stained ceilings. Bathrooms were very small ( even by uUK standards) and electrical system was dubious.Power sockets were loose on walls and coffee maker was in bathroom right at the side of the sink. The phrase, electricity and water , springs to mind.The corridors were uninviting and scruffy.The staff were very helpful and friendly.The restaurant was pricy and the cafe joined to the hotel was erratic with opening hours.This has a 4 * grading and i have seen many other hotels in Montreal with this grading much more appealing than this.I would not stay here again, nor recommend to others."
47,1486,"Jun 6 2006	Exactly what I wanted	I stayed at the BW Europa in May 2006. It is still a Best Western, unlike some of the listings in Trip Advisor. I had booked on the Internet at about 100 dollars through the BW website which I have found gets me a better price than some discount websites - I would struggle to get any hotel at this price in the UK.The location was ideal for me being 10 minutes walk from the main rail station and 5 minutes from Crescent and St Catherine. I had no problems on the streets up to 11 pm.I was well pleased by the hotel. The second floor room was freshly refurbished with a nice bathroom and had an ironing board and iron. It looked onto in internal courtyard and was quiet, I had one disturbance which may have been a rubbish collection but nothing else. The front and sides look onto quiet streets. Only at the rear where there is an open car park and a view onto Crescent would I think there might be some noise. The shower worked well. Breakfast was from 6 am to 11 with an attentive and helpful waiter offering a wide variety of breakfast items. The restaurant was closed on Sunday night but there are plenty of places to eat on Crescent. I would change one thing and put a bigger shelf in the bathroom if I were going to share the room. Everything was very clean and staff polite and helpful.As to the comments made by others, you might not like that the rooms were compact with no safe. Neither of these issues bothered me. I didnt need to park, I travel by train and rent a car if I need one on the day. The room would be cosy with 2 guests sharing.There is another Best Western on Sherbrooke, nearer the University but further out of the centre. Sherbrooke is quite busy with traffic. I think I chose the right one with the Europa and I would go again."
48,1486,"May 1 2006	Fine with us!	We were very satisfied with this hotel. We booked short notice, two days ahead and paid $129.00. It is a short walk from the train station; when we arrived (around noon) our room was not ready but the reception desk kindly offered to store our luggage. We took off for lunch and returned a few hours later but the room was still not ready. The staff were very apologetic and offered us a jacuzzi suite so we were pleased. The room was lovely! We had a great nights sleep and did not here any street noise. We went down for breakfast and had lots of fruit, etc. Our train did not leave until after check-out time but reception offered to store our luggage again which we thought was quite nice. The location of this hotel is super. I'm not sure if we just got lucky or if the rooms are being renovated but we had no complaints about anything!"
49,1486,"Apr 17 2006	It's the PITS!	I believe that this hotel misrepresents itself on the web. Yes parking is available,...it costs $20.00 per day to have it parked in a crumbling lot outside in front of the hotel. Breakfast was supposed to come with the reservation,...if breakfast counts as the self-serve coffee pot in your room, than I guess that's breakfast. There was no exercise room per the advertisement. The curtain in the room didn't close all the way and the hotel is downtown with bright city lights shining in. The heat didn't work and the man at the front desk resolved the situation by sending up extra blankets. The room was the size of a broom closet and the bathroom was so small, I had to put my feet on the edge of the tub to sit down on the toilet. They did have hot water, it just took five minutes to warm up. And the bed was so hard I would've been better off on the floor. And finally, they made the bed in a funky way by sandwiching the comforter in between two flat sheets to hide the stained mess of a comforter they had on the bed. As for the help, everyone actually seemed nice enough, they just didn't have any answers. I asked how much a phone call was and after waiting for fifteen minutes the girl came back with a helpless shrug. Even during peak lobby hours, they only had one girl behind the desk who was friendly enough, but it took us over an hour to check-out. I'm a well travelled person and I don't expect a lot out of a hotel, but this is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in outside of a third world country."
50,1486,"Mar 4 2006	Close to everything!	Great hotel! Good food at the resturant, great bar for relaxing and close to shopping and the Via Rail station"
51,1486,"Feb 16 2006	Smallest room ever...	Man, I look back and think abt this place and I'm like amazed. This place had the tiniest room EVER. Two people can't move around this room. We were hating ourselves for booking this room, but then we thought it was funny to bump into each other :-)The parking is a pain too. The only good part is it's downtown and you can walk around the place...I'd not go there again and suggest people to get a bigger room unless, of course, you're single. The pictures on their website actually enticed us. The lobby was great though, should admit..."
52,1486,"Nov 27 2005 	Left after the first night	I left the hotel for another one after the first night -- had I just trusted the bad reviews here...The room consisted of a large TV set (American-style), a bed, and a bathroom. It was lacking daylight (the window -- to the extent it wasn't blocked by the gargantuous air conditioner -- gave me a view of the courtyard, which had its ground level above the floor of the room), a chair, a table, and even an elementary amount of space.The breakfast buffet was rather elementary and uninviting, the coffee dreadful.I can confirm the alarm clocks in other room comments from others, and can also confirm the seemingly-recent over-the-top-ness of the lobby, which contrasts heavily with the rest of the hotel.There was nothing charming or &quot;European&quot; about this hotel. Don't go there."
53,1486,"Oct 25 2005 	I will never stay here again	I am a seasoned traveller &amp; this is by far the WORST place I have ever stayed. The only thing going for it is the location - it's right off Ste-Catherine St, one of the main drags in Montreal. But that's it.I checked in at 4:30pm on a Wednesday &amp; learned that my room wasn't yet ready, although check-in was 3pm. No apology or offer of alternate accomodations. I had requested a queen bed, non-smoking room and had to argue for something else in the meantime. They offered me a room with 2 doubles instead, since I absolutely had to prepare for a meeting and needed my room. I took it and when I made it upstairs, the room they had given me was under renovation -- construction tools all over the floor, the window A/C unit on the ground, dirt everywhere, no toilet. When I went back down to the front desk, there was again no apology and I was told I would need to wait at least 1 hours for ANYTHING to become available to me.It turns out the guy serving me was the front desk manager and didn't give a hoot about the extremely inconvenient situation in which he was placing me. I was carrying 2 suitcases and a laptop and he claimed there was no room for him to check them somewhere for me so that I could at least go find something to eat while waiting for my room. Luckily some extremely nice travellers from BC overheard my predicament and offered to keep my bags in THEIR room.Came back to the hotel at 6pm, as told, and finally my room was available, 3 hours after the 3pm check-in. Went upstairs, the key doesn't work. Went downstairs for re-coding. Back upstairs, key doesn't work again. Back downstairs for re-coding. Once I finally got in my room, to my utter non-surprise, the Europa drops the ball AGAIN. They gave me the most filthy, disgusting smoking room I've ever been in - browned wallpaper, film on the windows and cigarette burns on the bedspread. The smell was absolutely putrid (my brief time in this room had smelled up my clothes so badly that I had to have them cleaned the next day).Furious, I returned to the front desk and demanded the room I reserved. Luckily there had been a shift change and the useless front desk manager had been replaced by a lovely young woman who was gracious, apologetic and very understanding. She booked me into a suite with a king bed for my trouble. The room was acceptable, but dated and like the rest of the hotel, appeared cheap and dirty. There was a huge soaker tub in the bathroom which was its only redeeming quality. Given the overall shabby appearance of the hotel, my experience and the way I was treated, I will never stay here again. I wrote a 3-page complaint letter to Best Western head office once my trip was complete and they were at least nice enough to offer up a written apology for my negative experience.FYI, there is no parking available here, just a paid lot across the street. As well, all the windows in the rooms are sealed shut, so there is no way you can get fresh air into the room to at least chase some of the musty smell away.Do yourself a favour - spend an extra couple of bucks and go somewhere else. The price of this place is definitely appealing, but I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for."
54,1486,"Oct 5 2005	For those in need of a suite	We were able to find two rooms available at this hotel on a weekend with several conferences in town. We booked them right away over the phone without really knowing anything about the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, we were offered their penthouse suite, for the same $$ we were paying for the 2 seperate rooms. This is a huge suite. We had 2 very large rooms, 4!!!! bathrooms (1 with a whirlpool tub) a full eat in kitchen, very large living room, washer &amp; dryer &amp; the absolute best part was a large private tarrace with BBQ. This suite was very convinient as we were two families with 3 infants, &amp; they were able to run around all over. Now, for the negatives, While we thought this was a good deal for us, at the price we paid, we were told the running rate is apx. $1000.00 per night. At 1000.00 per night I would be very disapointed. The kitchen wasn't well stocked,( as to the basics, i.e., soap, paper towels, dish cloths, etc. ) the dryer in one bathroom wasn't working, one of the rooms did not have a t.v., there was a loud noise coming from the other side of the suite that sounded like some sort of machinery that went on all night long, it did not keep us, or more importantly our kids from sleeping, and you have to go up 2 flights of stairs, as the elevator stops two level below the suite. I would stay here again with kids, at the same price we paid."

It is a bit far from Old Port, however.The hotel is easy to find but if you arrive by car be prepared to pay an extra 17 CAD per night. That will give you access to an independently owned parking lot opposite of the hotel. And in this downtown area you do not have much choice when it comes to finding a place for your car.Once you are inside the hotel you will find yourself in a clean and luxurious European-style environment. I stayed in a well-sized room with excellent furniture including a business chair. Also, you will find an in-room coffee maker and a hair dryer. No fridge or microwave, though. The only downside was that there was no outside view. Only a wall of the opposite building.There are different rate plans available. Make sure that the breakfast is included in your rate. It really is worth every cent. It is served in the hotel restaurant and includes many hot and cold items like sausages and fruit.The overall rating is definitely above average. However, the hotel could get an excellent rating if the parking situation was better solved."
56,1486,"Sep 6 2005	Best Western Europa Downtown	We stayed in the Best Western for 4 nights in August 2005. We were extremely happy with the hotel. Our room was on the 3rd floor, yes it was a bit small but we had enough room to manoeuve around the bottom of the bed - could have did without the table and chairs. We couldn't fault the hotel. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the staff again were fantastic and the cleaning lady gave me extra large towels for the whole of our stay. The breakfast each morning was extensive and tasty and replenished regularly. Like other reviewers said it is in prime location to St Catherine's Street and everything is easily accessible from there. Only downside is that we dined in a restaurant on our last nite and the waiter complained that we didnt give him enough of a tip (We thought 13% of the bill wasnt too bad). He informed us that the standard is 15-20% or more. I could not believe the cheek so beware when tipping!!!! We have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - good value for money, prime location and good rooms."
57,1486,"Aug 24 2005	Nice place to stay	We stayed there for 2 nights in July 2005. The room was small, but very clean. The AC was loud and either just cold as ice or you to turn it off. Very friendly staff. The Breakfast was great. At that time the swimming world championships were in Montreal and we had the waterpolo team of Australia in our hotel. That was positive for my spouse, so she had something more to look at it. The hotel is near Bell Center and St. Catherines Street. If youre looking for a nice hotel at a fair price, this is the place to stay."
58,1486,"Aug 22 2005	Not bad really!	I guess it all depends on the traveller. I wouldn't stay here on a romantic weekend with my wife, but the purpose of my stay here was to go to the Hockey game with my buddies!The location is perfect, as mentioned in other reviews, and it is about a two minute walk to Centre Bell. One of the closest hotels to the arena. I think I was also blessed with the only large room of all the reviews. There was more than enough space in our double room.I really is good value."
59,1486,"Aug 9 2005	Not bad !	Hello !I have spend 3 nights in this hotel. I had booked it before I had read the reviews here so I was a bit worried that maybe I had booked too quickly. Ok, the lobby is a bit over the top, so what ? The room was small, but clean. So was the bathroom. I live in Europe and over here we are quite used to small rooms like that. There was a welcome coffee and tea set in the room. The airco can be put cooler or warmer, you just have to find the buttons. The hotel is situated at 2 minutes from St-Catharine street which is great. In short, I didn't have any complaint here in this hotel. The staff was friendly as well. If you don't look for grand luxury this is a good hotel. Of course, if you want the big thing, then you better look for a 4-star hotel."
60,1486,"Jul 4 2005	The rest of the story ...	I booked a room here wearily after reading all the mixed reviews, then checked in and discovered the rest of the story. One TripAdvisor guest complains this hotel is a &quot;fire hazard&quot; because a set of emergency stairs leads to an alley -- what he/she doesn't say is the small five-story hotel is adjacent to a city firehouse, making the location one of the safest around. Yes, the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea lobby is definitely different, and, yes, many of the guest rooms are small, but for $100 U.S. a night on a summer festival weekend, I couldn't find a cleaner, more comfortable value (and I started looking six months ago). Everyone from the check-in staff to housekeeping crew was hardworking, polite and professional. I'm glad a few disgruntled reviewers expecting the Ritz didn't discourage me from making a reservation at this hotel. For its central location, cost, cleanliness and comfort, I'll definitely stay at the Europa again."
61,1486,"Jun 30 2005	Tiny room ok location	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night on our recent trip to Quebec. The location was fine and the staff friendly and helpful, the price was decent compared to what I could find on the web from the US. However, the room was really tiny, I mean much worse than similar hotels I'dstayed in. There was only one chair so one of us always had to sit on the bed. There was no room around the bed to open a suitcase, for example on the floor, or a table. We had to use the bed for that as well. The bathroom was large by comparison. This might be alright for one person with limited luggage but we were on the tail end of a two week vacation so we had two large suitcases and room didn't work for us at all. Of all the hotels we stayed in during our trip this was the only one that made us feel so claustrophobic."
62,1486,"Jun 27 2005	Great Stay for the Price	My husband stayed at this hotel for 4 nights while were in Montreal for the F1 races. The front desk staff were very nice and professional as were the maids and restaurant staff. The room was better than okay. It was clean and the area in which we stayed was quiet. We received free breakfast with our stay and it was okay but plentiful.Overall, I enjoyed this hotel. Free bottled water each day (which was great as it was HOT and humid). We walked to restaurants and to the metro with no problems. We will stay again...."
63,1486,"Jun 17 2005	More that happy to return	We stayed here for 4 nights while at the F1 Grand Prix. Excellent hotel , clean, staff polite and smiling.Great free breakfast , more than enough to keep us going all day . Free bottle water &amp; fruit on offer all day in the lobby.Pleasent hotel bar to retrun too at night ! More than happy to return to hotel if I every come back to Montreal. As all Montreal hotels - cost more than normal that weekend due to the F1"
64,1486,"May 24 2005	I was very unhappy	In general I love the BW hotels. This one was easy to find. Centrally located. We asked for a quiet room, we got a room facing the street. Hotel has no parking, parking opposite charged CAD 17.50 add it to the price of the hotel and the deal is no deal. The room was tiny. We paid cash, gave the visa card as guarantee. Got back the visa slip the next day, found a month later that we have been debited for an extra CAD 12 and cannot get a reply why. Don't go there before you check all details."
65,1486,"Apr 20 2005	Depends on what you are looking for.	It really depends on the type of traveller you are. If you like to lounge in bed for many hours in the morning, watch movies...enjoy great room service etc.... this is NOT the hotel for you.This hotel is best suited for younger folks that will be spending very limited hours in the room. It's a great hotel just to put your head down at night and crash. The rooms are clean and humble, definately small. The hotel is definately safe.Probably the only reason I ever stayed at this place was when I was on a limited budget and wanted a place close to the action. There are 6 strip clubs less than 2 blocks from the hotel. A large number of really good fast food places serviing a variety of ethnic dishes, and the fabled Cresent street is only 2 streets west of the hotel.I do have to say the hotel bar is overpriced, and housekeeping takes forever if your room is higher than the 3rd floor.To summerize, you stay here for location and price. Not for luxury."
66,1486,"Apr 18 2005	no complaints	My sister from British Columbia met me in Montreal for the weekend, myself coming from Nova Scotia...Location, location, location,We booked this place before reading the reviews...so glad we did because I read a lot of negative reviews &amp; was worried..it was all for not..the desk staff was sooo friendly &amp; accomadating, the restaurant staff was friendly&amp; the room was as good as you can expect for the price you would pay anywhere else. The location was the best we could've gotten..right downtown,it was all there..had to add my 2 cents worth..Cathy"
67,1486,"Apr 2 2005 	Unprepared hostile and a fire hazard.	While on a band trip with my school concert band and choir, we stayed in the Best Western Europa Hotel. After I was checked in we attempted to enter our rooms. Their card key system did not work. I needed to get our room keys (cards) reprogramed seven times on the first day, and many times later during our three night trip. The cleaner used in my rooms left a bad odor. Although some staff members were helpful, kind and a pleasure to talk to, others were not. Prank callers phoned in and asked for a wake up call at two in the morning for my room, and the reception desk called us at eleven thirty PM to confirm the call. After I said that I did not want a wake up call that early and that it must have been a prank call, the lobby told me that they could not prevent the call as it was already entered into the computer. (Why bother comfirming if they could not change it)? This happened again, but I found out about it (while going down to fix my room key) before it was entered. What I found most ensulting about this hotel was the security gaurd, who used told a client (also on my trip) to &quot;shut up&quot; also using profanities. The ice machines were all broken but one on the fifth floor, the second floor vending machine ate your money and had no &quot;out of order sign&quot;. All the other ones were unstocked on many things. The maids (who were very nice) seemed overworked. Worst of all, the hotel only had one flight of stairs that did not open into the lobby instead to an ally beside (this door had an alarm but no warning of one). Not only did this make the elevators extremely busy, but also if there was a fire in the ally that had spread into the north end of the hotel, there would be no escape route, as would there be none for the first floor if the lobby was ablaze. The lobby workers were not helpful in giving directions either."
68,1486,Dec 2 2004	Not as bad as everyone else thinks	As two young travelers we really enjoyed our stay at this best western. our room was exceptionally large and spacey. and the bathroom was actually a good size and had complimentary pantene pro v shampoo and dove body wash! the location of the hotel was great because it is right off of st. catherines str. the service was great and we arrived around noon and we were able to check in early with no problem. the staff was very kind and considerate but there was a little mix up with the hotel price which was taken care of quickly and with no problems!! at night when we would return we felt very safe since there was a security officer waiting to greet us and let us in. The only real problem we had was the price of parking which was $38 which is inconvenient since parking is usually free. also the windows should not be sealed shut. having fresh air would have been nice. All in all we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again!
69,1486,"Nov 6 2004	Not that bad - a bit odd	We had two nights here, and found the location excellent. The room was OK, and the high speed internet access worked fine (unlike another Best Western we stayed in). We disliked the lack of fresh air in the room - unable to open the windows or adjust the aircon to allow fresh air in.The public rooms are decorated on a theme of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne - distinctive, but not to my taste!The guy overseeing breakfasts was very friendly and helpful - other staff less so."
70,1486,"Oct 26 2004	Worst - We Renamed it 'The Cave'	For $139/night you and your partner can stay in a closet - the space was the smallest room we have ever encountered in our travels. Thus we upgraded to $159/night - we could both walk around the bed at the same time! However, the view of the brick wall did not change from that of the first room. Also, this was a smoking room, with no ventilation and windows that were sealed shut. By morning our throats and nostrils were burning. By the way, we bought a bottle of wine, no corkscrew in the room, no fridge for that matter. Front desk would not loan us the corkscrew and we had to bring the bottle down to them! This six story, poorly kept hotel is a definate no-no in Montreal or anywhere. There are many affordable places to stay in Montreal. We checked out first thing and moved to another hotel."
71,1486,"Oct 26 2004	Not recommended	Simple. I would just stay somewhere else. The room we stayed in felt dirty and cheap. The staff were horrendous in they way they treat you. i stayed at 5 hotels in Canda on my trip, 4 were Best westerns. This was by far the worst. They argued with me about charges, then the next day they were myseriously missing off the bill. the bell boy informed me i had to tip him, and when i informed the manager that i would decide when to tip someone, she replied that they do not do that sort of thing there. I hope she tells the bell boy. Looking around there were more than enough hotels in the area for the same price if not cheaper, so why take the risk."
72,1486,"Oct 21 2004	A bit hard	Felt compelled to give my opinion following the string of bad reviews , my wife and i felt the hotel offered reasonable rooms in an excellent location for bars,shopping etc. Rooms were clean though a little basic and maintained every day, tried the asian restaurant but didn't like it (maybe down to my taste as others loved it). Found reception staff efficient and courteous and found the locality safe for such a lively area."
73,1486,"Sep 9 2004	Location overrides everything else	This is the BEST location to stay if you're into shopping, nightlife, people watching at a cafe, walking around to the sights or anything else Montreal. St. Catherine is 50 feet from the front door! The cafes and clubs on Cresent are just two blocks away. The hotel was easy to get to driving into Montreal and parked across the street (although a little pricey but all parking is). Ok, the room was a little crampy and the bathroom door bumped into the towel rack so it didn't open all the way. But spending more time outside of the room than in, it didn't bother me. I was able to sneak a peak into other rooms with 2 queen beds and they were a lot larger. It may just depend on which room or suite you get stuck with. We had a room at the end of the corridor whichh probably helped with the layout of it. The hotel could use a face-lift but everything I saw was clean and the staff was friendly, even when a group of 10 were looking for a sight-seeing tour at the height of check-ins. Overall, I would stay here again to be in the middle of it all without shelling out a lot of money (need to save that for the shopping)."
74,1486,"Sep 4 2004	Looks good from the outside-looks can be deceiving	Previously stayed at the nearby Novotel (one block west and recommended) and decided to try this hotel-looked nice from the outside. Good location but small rooms with very small bathrooms, about the worst view I've ever come across, stained carpet in the corridors and not particularly helpful staff when we arrived early. On site restaurants were never tried (there are far better in the neighbourhood -try Chez Cora for breakfast -a couple of blocks east). Not a comfortable spot from which to enjoy exploring Montreal (our favourite city). Hotel was one of the reasons we cut our stay (in Montreal) short. Not recommended."
75,1486,"Sep 3 2004	It's not as bad as everyone seems to think	Honestly, it's not as bad as everyone seems to think. I've stayed here twice (in the summer of 2003 and 2004), had a great stay both times and will continue to stay here in the future. Yes, the room is small and the lobby is alittle on the modern medival/tacky side, but who comes to Montreal to hang out in their hotel room? It's reasonably priced, has an amazing location (near Crescent St., Ste. Catherine St., and the Metro) and incredible restaurants are always easy to find.The staff is also very friendly and helpful. You might get the odd person who speaks french and not much english, but you have to remember.... you're in Montreal, what do you expect?"
76,1486,"Aug 28 2004	Do not stay!!	I DO NOT recommend this hotel at all. The only good thing I have to say is that the location is great. My husband and I decided to stay here on their web deal of stay 2 nights and get the 3rd free. What it didn't say is that you'd have to fight with reception to get this deal. The lobby is VERY tacky looking. The room we stayed in was appaulingly small. The bathroom is so small that you literally had to hang your feet into the bathtub to use the washroom. They also have no parking and no parking recommendations for you. For 3 nights we ended up having to pay $51 for parking. The hotel restaurant is Japanese only so if your not into that, then your screwed.Overall, I found the whole experience terrible, the staff not friendly at all and even though everything appeared clean, it felt very dirty."
77,1486,"Aug 22 2004	Best Western Europa - Montreal	We found your review to be right on! Location is great, lobby bordering tacky, food was okay, room was small, bathroom extremely small, heard other alarm clocks from empty rooms CONTINUOUSLY (reported to lobby-with no result), and not real clean."
78,1486,"Aug 19 2004	Not impressed	Stayed here in August 2004 - found the lobby unusual, verging on tacky! The rooms are very small and grubby and the bathrooms are tiny. Its in a good location but would not stay at this hotel again."

1,1493,"Sep 6 2007 	Nice staff lousy air conditioning	The hotel is located in a convenient suburban Montreal location near several highways. For the area it was a fair rate but the area is expensive in general. There were only a few people in the hotel so it was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The room upgraded quite nicely, including a nice and clean bathroom. Plenty of TV channels in both French and English. The only problem was the air conditioning. The control is an old dial thermostat which I could deal with but the AC was not cold. I figured it would take a while to cool down but when I laid down to go to sleep I was a bit too warm for comfort. If I had realized earlier that the AC wasn't going to cool the room I would have called the desk to be moved but I was already settled in so I dealt with it. Luckily it was a cool night and there is a window that opens. I would have some doubts about staying here again for the simple fact that the air conditioning was not effective."
2,1493,Jul 30 2006 	Fine for the money ...	My husband &amp; another couple headed up to Montreal for a quick weekend trip (2 nights) Checked around with different search engines to find something under $100.00 (only staying a night and a half) - no luck in city (the outgames going on) had to book outside. Went thru hotwire. Rooms were ok for our needs... just a place to sleep. 3 blocks from the bus station. Just be sure to request a non smoking room if you don't smoke. Even with the spray they gave us - it was overwheming. (hotel booked up and no non smoking available.) For the day and a half we were there is was ok but if staying any longer I'd look for somewhere else.Very basic hotel with limited cont. breakfast.
3,1493,Jul 27 2005	Comfortable	We have been staying at the Comfort Inn for several years. While the place is showing wear it is still a pleasant place to stay outside of Montreal. The accommodations are adequate; the price affordable. Taschereau Blvd. has many fine restaurants. Be aware that there is lots of traffic heading in and out of the city so avoid rush hours at all costs. There is a nearby bus with runs into the city. You need exact change for the ride.
4,1493,"Dec 6 2003	AIRPLANE ENGINE IN THE ROOM	This is my second time to stay in this hotel. Found holiday rate of approx CAD75 from Choice Hotel web iste. However, upon check-in (I did not make reservation) front desk staff claimed there is never any &quot;holiday rate&quot; and quoted eighty something. Fortunately, a supervisor came by and I told him what I got from the website. After a few clicking on their own computer, I was given the &quot;holiday rate&quot; although I was asked whether I am a CAA member which is not the condition of getting this &quot;holiday rate&quot;. I said I am not a CAA member but I normally can get their senior rate. He accepted and I finally get this &quot;holiday rate&quot; Room is average size but the heating system in my room is apparently not in order. It sound like an airplane engine each and every time when it is running. I did not bother to change room as I stayed only one night plus the fact that I found out this problm late at night (after a very time consuming french dinner in the city)"
1,1494,Oct 21 2009 	Great Airport Hotel	THis is a very trendy hotel located within the international departures of the Montreal Airport. CHeck in was wonderful and fast. The rooms were large and airy and the beds were absolutely divine. We were just staying for 7 hrs on a stop over to florida. I would highly recommend this to anyone needed to have a stop over in montreal or needing to catch an early morning flight.Cons: pay wireless internet.
2,1494,"Aug 7 2009 	Nice Hotel	We stayed at the Marriott the weekend of July 30 to August 3. We were in Montreal for a 3 day convention. This is a new, well kept hotel. The rooms are of reasonable size and the beds are very comfortable. There are a variety of restaurants in the area of the hotel and highway access is close.We had the buffet breakfast one day and it was good, although a little expensive-$14.75. Our 6 year old was $8, and she only ate part of a Belgium waffle. Over all a great hotel and we had a good time and a great price, (convention rate). We would stay there again."
3,1494,"Apr 10 2009 	Very Clean	We decided to stay there as they let us park our car while we were away for a week. Our flight was in the evening and they were able to extend our check-out time from 12pm to 1pm. I like their complementary airport shuttle bus service. Our room was very clean and there were two soap bars and a small bottle of shampoo &amp; conditioner in the bathroom. Occasionally, we saw airplanes flying in and out of the nearby airport, MontralPierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, but we were not bothered by the sound at all."
4,1494,"Feb 11 2009 	Great place for park and fly	Being a Holiday Inn member for years I was concerned of the number of bad reviews we read of their hotels near the Montreal Trudeau Airport. These are popular due to their park and fly options. We decided to try Courtyard by Mariott. What a pleasant surprise. The price for at two week park and fly including one night king room was $144 with tax. The hotel is clean and the room was great. Bathroom spotless and nice hand creams, body lotion, coffee maker. The bed is a comfort guarantee. Even though the room was on the freeway side the noise was non existent. Shuttle to and from the airport was free and the pick up and drop off very efficient. If you consider the cost of parking for two weeks you just can't go wrong. No, the parking is not covered nor is it secured as it is just the hotel parking lot but that was not the issue for us."
5,1494,"Oct 7 2008 	Liked the Hotel Not the Location	Very nice hotel with good staff, comfortable bed, nice decor. The location in an industrial business park is not one for walking around and certainly not scenic. A bit complicated to get to from the highway--I could see it but couldn't get to it! You have to use a service road. It had a nice restaurant and there are a few in walking distance--a grill and a McDonalds. Long way to downtown and the Old City. The front desk gave me directions to the Metro station and that was better than driving and paying for parking. Not walkable to the Metro though. Fortunately I had a car. I think tourists would be better off downtown. Kind of inconvenient."
6,1494,"Sep 4 2008 	Kids Loved It 	This was our first time in Montreal, and I was very much impressed by this hotel. We had a car to get around the city so the location was great for us, and you couldn't even hear the airport at all, my kids kept asking where the airport was, that's how quite it was. Great price, right off the highway, mall closeby, with East Side Mario's, Mike's Restaurant, and many others. Clean, clean, clean, and new (that was important to us). I didn't want to sleep in an old smokey hotel room, so this hotel was perfect!! Pool was great (salt water), and exercise room with modern and working equipent &amp; tv. It overall left a great impression on our family, and we would defintiely return."
7,1494,"Jul 12 2008 	Super amazing!!! Stay for the airport cause it's not downtown.	Great hotel... close to airport but you cannot hear the planes go by at night.Food is good, but expensive.Hotel quality is great, service is great and close to airport.Business services are great... 3 computers downstairs and free printer.Love it, love it, love it!I paid $104 for the room."
8,1494,Jul 9 2008 	Very Nice Affordable Brand New	Stayed at the Montreal Montreal Airport for one night. The room was very clean with brand new furniture (hotel is brand new). The front desk agent was very friendly and our check-in was very fast. Very nice pool with salt water. Nice tub as well. Would defenetly recommend it and I will stay there again if going to Montreal.
9,1494,"May 16 2008 	Great rooms!	Had a one day training session so the company booked it for me. Brought the family over and extended it for one more day...total days: 2.Didn't expect anything special as I've never stayed in Courtyards. Usually Hojo types. Building looked bland, so no big deal. Didn't expect anything anyway. But I was really tired from sitting beside my crying children, anything with a roof would have been heaven. Wife drove because I haven't slept but that's for another story...Imagine our surprise, when the automatic doors opened, and were greeted with a warm Bonjour from the front desk. Wow! Great reception hall, at least for its kind...priceline rated it at 2.5 stars...it should get at least a 3.5 for the reception hall.Off to the rooms, and noticed the halls are wide (not like Vancouver hotels)--which was a good thing because we had a double side by side stroller...opened the rooms..Wow! very clean, and well appointed rooms! I thought wow, we got this room for $89!?! What a [----] bargain! Very clean, very nice bathroom...loved the delta faucets. Wish I could get these for my house.Our toddler immediately lit up and ran back and forth in the room...bounced up and down the bed. You don't know how much it was a relief to rest after 6 hours driving. With these kind of appointments, my wife actually was able to take out the clothes and use the drawers...she never use them because she says they're all &quot;icky&quot;...but here she was laying our clothes out, nice and folded. Complaints? Kids room in the basement is bland and nothing much in terms of activities there...well these are usually for business people, so I can't really blame the hotel...also our room window is facing the highway...the noise is not much, but its there and we hear some from the airport itselfOverall, a great experience, family loved it...walked to the Spheron and checked out a small bistro there...great beef paninis and soup!"
10,1494,"Sep 17 2007 	Lovely but noisy.	This is a relatively expensive hotel for an airport hotel. However, it is lovely, newly decorated, modern, cosy. There is an airport shuttle bus which is fast and convenient, and the driver was great. The bus trip comes complete with complimentary apples and water too!The hotel itself is in quite a good location, close to a small-ish mall, cinema and a number of restaurants which are all within walking distance. It is also possible to walk to a tube station, but this might be a little too far for some: about half and hour's speed-march away.The only problem that I have with this hotel is: it is an airport hotel, and close to a busy road, and is therefore noisy. I am certainly not a light sleeper, but would have been gald of a pair of earplugs for this one!"
11,1494,"Sep 11 2007 	Comfortable Hotel close to access	A wonderful stay, room was very comfortable and clean. Only complaint was the wired internet connection in my room was on the slow side, but my other coworkers who stayed there had no complaint, so maybe it was just me. Staff spoke both English and French and were helpful. The restaurant served a great breakfast, with made to order eggs, bacon, sausage, and make-your-own Belgian waffles, around $10 US. I liked that this was some distance (15 minutes) from downtown as it and driving was more relaxed. East access to the 40 and the airport. No problems with the free airport shuttle. Across the street is a movie complex and several restaurants, including the FireGrill restaurant -- great food and service."
12,1494,"Sep 10 2007 	One of the best Courtyard	Though the family stayed one night, we had a wonderful time there. Building, room, bathroom (washroom), room decor, and etc were in excellent conditions. One of the best Courtyards I have stayed in so far.Also, though our view including the flight path for the airport (kids loved it), you still could not hear any (jet) noise even with the window slightly open.Staff was helpful, bilingual, and greeted you with a smile.Though I am not sure what the other hotels around the airport offer, but I would recommend this facility to anybody needing accommodations near the airport.However the only complaint I have is the parking situation due to its location. There is only a dozen parking spaces located out front and the main parking lot was at the opposite end (from our room) of the building."
13,1494,"Aug 29 2007 	Very nice hotel stay away from the airport shuttle	I stayed at this hotel for one night. It's in a good location, close to the airport with some shopping and restaurants within walking distance. The staff was nice and they spoke English and French. The room A/C worked very well and the bathroom had great lighting and was extremely clean. No problems with the internet. I did experience significant problem getting picked up from the airport via the free shuttle. I had to call the hotel 3 times and waited over 45 minutes. No apology or explanation regarding the delay was given by the driver. My reaction to this situation was to forget leaving a tip for her. Overall, I'd stay here again."
14,1494,"Jul 18 2007 	Great Place  Fantastic Staff	Fantastic place for business and family travel, for anyone doing business in the area.The rooms are well kept &amp; very very clean.The staff go out of their way to enusre that your stay is comfortable &amp; convienient.I have stayed at this hotel almost every week for the past 7 months, and have never had a bad experience."
15,1494,"May 28 2007	A Place To Stay	We have stayed at this location about 5 times this year and everytime we stay there it's always the ROYAL TREATMENT. The staff is great and very helpful. The location is super clean and location is close to everything. I've spoken to the wonderful ladies at the front desk and have mentioned that we won't be able to come during the summer months, but will return again after our busy season in the Eastern Townships. It's the place to stay."
16,1494,"Apr 29 2007 	Beautiful Very Up-Scale Courtyard Hotel	April 24, 2006 - The Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel is a beautiful hotel. It is nicer than many of the full-service Marriott hotels that I have stayed at in the past. Every aspect of the hotel exhibits a very high level of quality. Service is excellent.The hotel is located adjacent to Canada 40 and between exits 62 and 65, close to the Montreal Trudeau airport. While we could see the hotel from the highway we had trouble finding it. We called the front desk and the associate helped us with directions immediately.Arriving at the Courtyard check-in was Marriott fast, taking under a minute. Our group of three all received the King rooms as requested. The room rate was $134 Canadian using an available AAA rate.My room was #314, was close to the elevator. The room was beautiful. The dcor and quality of the furnishings impressed me. The bed was firm, but very comfortable. There were both feather and foam pillows and the quality and feel of the linens was excellent. Even though my room faced the freeway I did not hear any highway noise.The room had a flat screen TV with a large variety of both Canadian and US channels. I was pleased to find the Lakers game on TNT, even though they lost! There was also a large selection of pay-per-view movies.The work area was large and featured a two level desk. The bottom level could be pulled out to increase the desk area. There was a comfortable and functional office-style chair and lighting was good. Electrical and broadband connections were conveniently located above the desk.Across from the work area was a sofa and coffee table. The sofa was very comfortable. I did not check, but believe that it was also a sofa bed. Heat and air conditioning was centrally located and quiet.The hotel offers wired complimentary high speed internet service in rooms. The Data Valet service worked well. Running the Speakeasy internet speed test showed a download speed of 570K and upload at 95K. While the regular internet connection worked well, it did not work as reliably with our companys VPN as most Marriott properties do. It took several minutes for Outlook to connect and it went on and off-line several times in three hours. The bathroom was large and also decorated nicely. The combination tub and shower had a great shower head and plenty of hot water which flowed immediately. There were enough thick white towels for four guests. It may be an unusual comment, but the plumbing fixtures in the bathroom were very high quality! Lighting was good and the granite vanity large. Bath amenities included shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.One feature of the new-design Courtyard rooms is the coffee bar area. It has a four-cup coffee maker, is well lit, and has a granite counter top and a mini refrigerator under the counter.A business associate and I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. As part of the buffet, there is an omelet station. The buffet was pretty standard having a good selection of both hot and cold items. The cost for two complete breakfasts was $28.00 Canadian. Service was prompt and excellent.The Courtyard is connected to a Residence Inn, something that I have not seen before. The two hotels share an indoor swimming pool, large exercise room, and large guest laundry on the lower level of the Courtyard. Next to the guest laundry was a childrens play room with a window between the two.Everyone at the hotel spoke excellent English all though their initial greeting was in French.I really liked the Courtyard Montreal Airport hotel. It is a beautiful property with really excellent service."
17,1494,Mar 20 2007 	0 on 10 For flavour but the rooms looked nice in the pamphlet card	Too Bad. I like Marriott and the rewards plan was good but this hotelhas no real flavour. I felt like I was in a walmart or a hospital waiting to check in. The local area is sorta in the middle of no where and a walk to he local submway was way too long and cold. I overpaid at nearly $133 and what is included. Nothing. I would upload a photo or two but I erased them in a rush to forget Montreal and this hotel in general. Some one tried to tell me its new. Why does it look like an office building that was changed into an apartment building. I am going to stay elsewhere next time I get stuck in Saint Larent. Sometimes its nice when a hotel has flavour and real amenities. Don't ask me about the pool. I almost hit my head on the ceiling. I am booking a days inn in Toronto next week and I think that I will be better off. At least the rate affords me free breakfast. Good luck in Montreal fellas. It was worth it still. NOT.
18,1494,"Mar 10 2007 	Great airport hotel	This is an extremely pleasant hotel with a quality feel to everything you touch. Now one year old it still feels as clean and polished as if it opened yesterday. Close by car to the airport, although a twisty confusing route after you leave the main highway so study that map first! Plenty of snack restaurants within walking distance. Double-queen room very large and well-appointed but with wired internet which frustratingly did not work for me (seemed like broken DHCP server.) Lobby area had excellent free wireless however. We stayed here on a Sunday night and pretty much had the place to ourselves so can't truly comment on noise but we never heard a thing . The construction looks solid enough to discourage disturbance from corridors or neighbouring rooms. Did not eat in restaurant but the bar although comfortable was as usual in hotels rather expensive.Not much else to add to previous reviewers except to emphasise the friendliness of the staff who were great. We used their excellent free airport shuttle-bus but had difficulty locating it at YUL. You have to exit the revolving door from arrivals onto the roadway then look for &quot;poste&quot; (pickup point) number 8 which did not appear to exist. What they forgot to tell me is that you have to cross the first line of postes entirely and you find another roadway, this time including one numbered 8."
19,1494,"Feb 25 2007 	One of the best in chain	RECOMMENDED. Always a fan of Courtyards for predictable quality. This ~ 1-year old property does not disappoint. A modern multi-story facility directly connected to the Suites hotel next door. Decor is modern. All facilities in excellent solid condition. Checkin fast n' friendly. Room quiet despite location next to Trans Canada highway. Rooms well laid out with contemporary styling. Bedding exceptional. Bath area well illuminiated and with bit more style than old gen Courtyards. Easy highway access, this is an industrial area, downtown 15-25 minutes away. Overall - one of the best Courtyards in my experience."
20,1494,Jan 8 2007	Great hotel and wonderful staff	We recently attended with our sports team to a tournament in Montreal. Everything was arranged by telephone and from the moment we got there the facilities and service were top notch.The staff were friendly and knowledgable. The check in with a large group went very quick as the hotel was organized and were waiting for us. The staff were always available to help us out. They provided a free room to store our equipment. The rooms were excellent and the price was more than affordable. Travelling all over Canada to numerous tournaments and over the various years this would rate as the best hotel we have ever used.
21,1494,"Nov 27 2006 	Pefect accomodation for the area	The previous reviewer gave an excellent detailed overview, so not too much to add for description. This is definetely best suited if you have business in the area or are looking for an airport (15 min travel time) hotel. If you are looking for city center, then stay in the center.Yes it is new (I stayed in late Nov. '06) but I found the design, finish and detail well above average. Staff were very friendly and helpful, terrific rooms and I rate the gym well above average for this type of hotel, all brand new best-quality equipment. Only way to beat this would be a dedicated health club.For an industrial type location, it is nice to be able to walk 10 minutes to shops, theatre and a variety of restaurants as I didn;t have a car rented (I could walk to our office).Bonus to me was location, large rooms, free internet, large bathroom with large towells and lots of shelves, the great gym and a decent full breakfast available for a decent rate. I was on the north side and was very quiet. Missed a few more batroom amenities but that was minor."
22,1494,"Sep 5 2006 	New slightly upscale Courtyard but you probably need a car to downtown.	The Courtyard Montreal Airport is a new, above average Courtyard that nevertheless follows the formula set by this Marriott chain.LOCATION: About 10 minutes by Hotel van from the airport, 15 to 30 minuntes by car to Centre Ville(downtown) depending on traffic. In the Northwest corner of Montreal's St. Laurent neighborhood, which affords some facilities in walking distance despite the industrial office park location(see surrounding area below). The building is less distinctive looking than its picture(ie. bland modern).LOBBY: High ceiling, off white tile foor, lighted panel photos of downtown and two attractive lounge areas all well lit give the lobby a clean attractive feeling with a slight touch of elegance. The restaurant(now breakfast and dinner), a small bar(no license yet) sit behind the main lounge and are more upscale than usually found at Courtyards.Rooms: Elevator floor landings are reminiscent of full service Marriotts, hallways are bright with a multicolored modern carpet.Rooms have deep blue carpeting with sperical silver design and some seafoam green, and a muted version of this green is reflected in the wallpaper-all and all, quite attractive. Floor to ceiling sheer curtains backed by a blackout curtain, and faux cherrywood furnishings round out the look. Bedding is the lastest in Courtyard bedding(a welcome change)-white comforters with foot mufflers, upscale linens. The beds are very firm but still have decent padding, though I liked the memory foam laden beds in the new Courtyard in Hershey, PA that I stayed in last December a whole lot better. Rooms have an alcove with a small refridgerator, and there is a flat screened but traditional TV. Rooms are a decent size, but 4 rooms per floor have an extended length adding a sofa to both the two queen bedded rooms and the king bedded ones.(these rooms are spacious). Ceilings on the 6th(top)floor have 10 foot ceilings, adding some spaciousness to even the traditional rooms(we stayed over our 7 days in all three versions of the 2 queen bedded rooms). Bathrooms are a decent size(if not large) but are attractive with faux tile floors and faux green marble in a number of places. Bath amenities are stingy, two small bars of soap, and a container each of shampoo and conditioner. An in wall air/heat unit with thermostat for each room. One room we stayed in had an unpleasant compressor noise from the AC, the other two rooms were fine. Only windows on the north side of the building open. Muted sounds from the hallways was the only noise we heard.Hotel Amenities: There appears to be some room service. In the basement there is a decent sized heated pool and hot tub, a small excersize room, a childrens playroom and modern washers and dryers, all shared with the attached Residence Inn, as yet unopened when we were there. Off the lobby, there is a card key entry room with five PC's and a printer, and a bank of hook-ups for your laptop in one of the lounges, all free of charge.There is a tiny store for snacks, etc.Surrounding Area: None of it pretty, but a block away is an entertainment complex with a very comfortable multi-screen cinema(showing many American films), upscale Italian, SteakHouse and Chinese Buffet restaurants, a downscale breakfast and snack bar, and an Ok coffee house plus, I believe, some sort of nightclub. Across the street is McDonalds, a chain family restaurant and a chain Sports Bar. There is a pizza place behind the complex. A small block further is a mid-size indoor mall with 3 department stores. Our favorite place for breakfast, Chez Coras was a 10 minute walk thru parking lots or ask the hotel van to take you. Chez Coras is Canada's IHOP, but so much better!Staff: Very pleasant, not always knowledgable and trying to get the new hotel off to a good start which was sometimes confusing for them and their guests. We always got a warm Bonsoir when entering the lobby. And, unlike other Courtyards, there was a bellman on hand to help with luggage. No concierge.There is no Courtyard and no outdoor space you would like to spend time in. One final warning-driving in Montreal can be difficult. Signs are universally only in French despite the bi-lingual billing of the city."
1,1495,Oct 14 2009 	Hotel's clean but due for renovation	The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal and it's easily accessible to a lot of tourist attraction. Hotel's clean and staffs are very friendly but it's due badly for renovation. It has no swimming pool either.
2,1495,"Oct 12 2009 	Good location good service but hotel could use updates	Stayed here while taking my daughter on a trip to visit McGill university. It is a great location and the service staff was very helpful. Lobby is small, elevator was broken and hallways were a bit shabby."
3,1495,"Sep 27 2009 	Unforgettable memories	The day we went to Montreal, the weather was horrible, it was raining. Our bus arrived early and we were thankful that we were able to check-in early. The staff was super nice. The hotel was clean, the beds were soooo comfortable. Most of the time we spent was in hotel because of the weather but we didn't mind. Location was pretty good. Beautiful during the night time. We honestly enjoyed it!"
4,1495,Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful as always	Another one night stay but we wished it was longer. A lovely hotel - friendly and efficient staff and well equipped rooms (515 is very good). Now they have a resteraunt which serves good food and is no more expensive than most resteraunts in Quebec City. We have stayed here several times now and find it's location - just inside Port St Jean - and amenities excellent.
5,1495,"Jul 8 2009 	manage your expectations	I stayed 3 nights during June. Due to a good offer, I chose this Marriott over the other one (Chateau Champlain) which I stayed last time. I didn't expect it to be at the high end but it is not too bad as it is an old building.Surprisingly, it is not noisy during day or night. The room is small and the bathroom is tiny too as expected but the desk is quite big. Everything is quite dated and worn. Even the pillows are over-used. The air conditioner is super noisy so I had to turn it off in order to sleep. The internet is free and it pretty reliable. The only new thing in the room is the TV which is flat screen.The only thing that really bothered me was finding someone's hair on the bed and in the bathroom. I think is belongs to the maid.The hotel offered buffet breakfast for $11.99 which includes coffee and juice but who can eat so much in the morning.With all the hotels on that street including the brand new Holiday Inn and Hilton Garden Inn beside this hotel, nobody will stay here if Marriott don't make some improvements. I was informed that the hotel will undergo major renovations at the end of the year so I might consider this hotel again when it is all done."
6,1495,"Jun 11 2009 	Needs to be Updated	The Pros  Really good location. Walking distance to many restaurants. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Cleaning crew was very thorough. The Cons  Rooms were small. Dcor needs to be updated. I prefer white comforters as most of the Marriott Residence Inns have in all of their standard rooms. That way, you know that the comforters are clean. Other than breakfast, there is no dining in the hotel restaurant."
7,1495,"Jun 5 2009 	Extremely Disappointed	The moment I saw that you had to drag your suitcase up a few steps to get to the elevator I should have know this hotel didn't take into consideration the comfort of their guests. I think in the U.S. this would be a violation. Enough of that. I found the bed extremely hard. The heating/air conditioner unit was the old style jutting out from under the window. Noisy, could never get the right temperatur. Its the type you find in a seedy motel. Ugh. I also found the rooms to be quite small compared to the Courtyard I had just been in Quebec. Also, the midnight to morning clerk didn't understand English.Now that is just the hotel, which I chose so I can't blame them for this, but the location was terrible. All the action/activity/theater/resturants are closer toward the water. There is another Marriott closer to Notre Dame Basillica. Chose that one for location and you will be better off."
8,1495,"Apr 26 2009 	Don't go there.	We stayed at the Mariott for business. They put a group of students on party in the room next to us. We haven't been able to sleep. Totally unacceptable from a four stars hotel. Even without that, the room was very noisy. Also the room was small and the staff didn't look very serious. For about the same price, it's much better to go to the Delta Hotel just behind the Mariott."
9,1495,"Jan 13 2009 	Best Stay Ever	This Hotel was Excellent the moment i set foot in The lobby, The staff is very respectful , there is also a bell boy who takes your stuff up to your room and we got a perfect rate 99$ a night , the beds are the best and they even give you the choice of what pillow you want! The hotel is pretty small about 8 rooms per floor but thats actually good so there is less noise the only complain i have is that the bathroom was a bit too small and that the valet parking is 20 bucks a night , either than that this hotel is perfect!"
10,1495,Jan 1 2009 	Mediocre room and ok location	Rooms were mediocre but fairly beaten up.There was a bug in the bathroom. Also my wife and son woke up with several mysterious itchy bed bug bites.The breakfast was not the best.The front desk staff was OK.The internet connection was intermittent.We were able to walk from the hotel to the metro and to the downtown area.I agree with the person who wrote an earlier review that said that the bulldozer would be the right next step for this property.This was not up to the high typical standards of Courtyard Marriott.
11,1495,"Dec 28 2008 	Rude and Incompetent Staff	My boyfriend took me to Montreal for a nice getaway. When he booked the hotel, they told us that they were the closest Marriott Hotel near the gay village. They were not. Two other Marriott hotels were closer than this one.When we checked into the hotel, we specifically requested for a non smoking room. They told us that this was a non smoking hotel. However, when we entered our room, the rooms extremely musty. The previous tenants probably were smoking illegally in the room. We asked for a different room but were told that they were sold out. I have asthma, and I had a very difficult time sleeping that night. The following morning, I spoke with the manager on duty. He said that he would resolve the situation. When we came back to our room the following day, the room still had that musty tobacco smell, but this time, I could smell the cheap Lysol they sprayed in the air trying to cover the smoke, but it did not work whatsoever. I called downstairs to the front desk, and they told me that the manager took care of the situation. I told them to come up and smell the room for themselves. We took a nap, but no one ever came to investigate. When we went out later that evening, I told the front desk about the room. He said that he would get someone to look at it. When we came back, there was no difference.The following day we checked out. I saw the manager on duty, and I told him how disappointing our stay was. He said that he &quot;sprayed&quot; a cleanser in the air. I told him that it did not work. I also told him that someone was supposed to come and smell the room, but no one showed up. He said that they were too busy. I guess they were too busy for guests that were not satisfied with their room.This hotel has very poor services, and we will not stay here again. I am very dissatisfied with this hotel."
12,1495,"Dec 9 2008 	Consistent Mediocrity	Marriott earns my business year-in and year-out; I have been a Platinum status guest for over a decade. In general, I view Marriott like McDonald's - they never serve &quot;the best&quot;, but, the product (in this case, lodging) is predictable.This property is amazing small (only 9 rooms/floor), and the staff is invisible - I never heard from or saw any staff members, after check-in, which is very unusual. This property recently stopped charging for internet access (welcome to the 21st century).Their room rate is rather competitive and the location is hard to beat (close to Schwartz's Deli, Old City, and Rue St. Denis).I view this property as a place to sleep, and not much more. Montreal is an awesome city, and, frankly, unless you're ill, there's not a good reason to spend much time in your room, irrespective of where you stay.As a romantic destination, it didn't score a lot of points with my wife, but, Montreal, itself, certainly did."
13,1495,"Oct 9 2008	it was okay but would not stay there again	This was my 6th time to Montreal and my first and last time at this hotel. The lobby was pretty beat up. Rooms were dated. The bathtub would fill up with water when I had a show. And the hotel staff were pretty much invisible. When you have to take the elevator to your room, you have to lift your suitcase up a 4 stairs before you can make it to the elevator. The food in the restaurant was overpriced. The location is okay but there is a newer holiday inn right next door and a four points right across the street."
14,1495,"Sep 25 2008 	Awesome City!	My partner &amp; I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott hotel in Downtown Montreal in March. Overall the hotel was pretty nice and very convenient as far as location goes. The hotel itself was a couple of blocks away from the subway station. We did the Breakfast buffet one time and it was pretty good with a nice selection of food. Tons of good local restaurants there! We did not go hungry while there! The room itself was very nice, as it was two rooms and it reminded me of a boutique style hotel room. The view from the room was nice with a skyline view of the Downtown neighborhood. I wish I could rember the name of the Concierge, as I found him to be extremely helpful and very polite to us. This was our first time travelling to Montreal and we both enjoyed it. The architecture &amp; history is awesome as was Notre Dame. We did the evening light show at Notre Dame and that was nice."
15,1495,"Sep 19 2008 	Enjoyable Stay.	I stayed here mid-September 2008 with my wife and 6-year-old son, for the combined reason of business meeting/vacation. I have to admit that I was very impressed by the very welcoming, friendly, and efficient staff. It was a little difficult to find because of construction downtown, my unfamiliarity with Montreal and problems with our GPS unit - even with directions from AAA in hand. But once found, it was clearly in the midst of things - a short 15-30 minute walk to the Palais des Congress, Old Montreal, and the Mont Royal Park. It was also a short 10 minute walk to the Metro. Parking (for ~$18 (canadian) daily) was available with unlimited in/out privileges but, honestly, it was much easier to get around Montreal without a car.The room was comfortable, clean and well-maintained. We had a nice view of the Mont Royal Park. There was a complimentary wireless internet connection. There was an indoor pool/fitness center available for my family to use and, although I was unable to use it, I was told that it was adequate. There was a lifeguard available and the pool was closed when the lifeguard was off duty 11 am - 4 pm, which greatly limited the use of the pool.Overall, a pleasant experience and a very good value in comparison to other hotels in Montreal (and other major cities)."
16,1495,"Sep 17 2008 	Good Hotel for Those on a Budget	This place isn't as bad as all those reviews make it sound. Sure, the bathroom &amp; room itself are small, but for a 3-star hotel, it can't be beat if you're on a budget.PROS:- Everything in the hotel is very clean. - Beds &amp; pillows are comfy- Shower water pressure was great.- Breakfast buffet was pretty good (a little overpriced at $13.95 CAD for what you get, however). - LOCATION - this place is within walking distance of everything, it was only about a 15-20 minute walk to the Latin Quarter (which you must check out if you're staying a few nights... Rue St. Denis, great restaurants &amp; bars) and a 15 minute walk to Old Montreal- Staff were very helpful and spoke very good English, check-in and check-out were a breeze- FREE WIRELESS INTERNET in all rooms! Also, coffee maker, desk, iron &amp; ironing board, nice little hairdryer... all you need- Reasonable prices &amp; selection for room serviceCONS:- Slightly small bathroom - Windows in the rooms did not open, and so it always smelled a bit musty- The light in our bathroom took forever (sometimes over a minute!) to come on, which was a bit of a pain in the middle of the nightAll in all, the hotel was ok, and I would definitely consider staying there again the next time I'm in Montreal. -"
