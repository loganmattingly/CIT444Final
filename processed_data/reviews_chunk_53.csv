88,1212,"May 22 2007 	Special!	My friend and I booked the Dorchester because it was opposite Hyde Park and we had entered the &quot;Playtex Moonwalk&quot; for Breast Cancer Research. When we arrived our room was not ready so we had a pot of tea in the Promenade. However our room still was not ready but it wasn't a problem as everyone was very polite. We went off to have a spot of lunch at the Hard Rock Cafe, which was great. The room was ready when we arrived back, and it was a great room with lovely decoration, poor view but this did not bother us. I ordered a pot of tea through room service as they do not provide tea and coffee making facilities in the room. However, this experience was not a great one as we had to wait for over an hour, I rang after 45 minutes and then waited another 20. Everyone apologised so I thought well not to worry. We went off to do our &quot;Moonwalk&quot; and arrived back approximately 5.00am on arriving in our room we ordered another pot of tea, again we had a long wait, if this had been the first time as it was 5:00am I would have thought fair enough, but ....Breakfast was the best and afternoon tea superb. Our overall experience was excellent as the service in every other area was special.I did give them feedback about the wait for room service and they were very apologetic. It wouldn't have really been anything to complain about but we English enjoy our tea.The Doorman was the most friendly I have ever come across and made us feel really special.Thank you Dorchester"
89,1212,"May 13 2007 	Great but lots of working being done...	Stayed here in the summer of 2005 and they were extensively renovating, resulting in closed restaurants and lots of noise. Looking at recent reviews it appears that the work still hasn't stopped to be careful. Other than the renovating the hotel was great. Very large rooms, great bathrooms (along with those famous bathtubs) and overall very wonderful staff. The location is very pretty but not exactly near all the tourist areas.Overall a very good experience at the Dorchester. It seems to be showing its age lately but I guess thats why they've been working on it for so long. If you prefer the more traditional hotel, this is the hotel for you. If you're looking for a more modern touch (what i typically prefer, you might want to look elsewhere)."
90,1212,"Apr 18 2007 	A class act of perfection	We stayed at the Dorchester for four nights over Easter having not stayed there for several years. The experience was wonderful with smooth and sniling service in plush surroundings.Our room was a deluxe room which overlooked Mayfair which is not the best view - the Hyde Park rooms would have a more picturesque view. However the room was large with lovely traditional, quality furnishings and a great bathroom - natural light, one of the biggest baths in London and a shower that could accomodate four should you so wish! Toiletries were all Floris with luxury robes and a surfeit of towels.The in room entertainment facility was good with internet and films reasonably priced. There were two soft chairs and a chaise longue and working desk.The public areas of the hotel can only be described as stunning, especially the Promenade where breakfast, teas etc are served. The Grill Room is done in grand Scottish decor and is really impressive.Throughout our stay theservice from all staff was exemplary and there was always staff on hand.The hotel is in a great situation with Hyde Park across the road, Mayfair on your doorstep and Knightsbidge ten minutes walk away. There is always plenty of taxis if one of the Ferraris, Lamborghinis or Rolls parked outside does not belong to you.Our Easter rate was a good deal for the class of hotel and included a bottle of Champagne and breakfast each day ( which if we were paying would seriously mount up).Great experience."
91,1212,"Apr 16 2007 	Still good but be careful!	Well I have been lucky enough to go back to the Dorchester and it had a few issues!Firstly they are working on the 9th floor and as such, there is noise from 9 to 5 Mon to Fri and 11 to 5 sat &amp; Sun (which did surprise me!) The hotel did not advise me of this when I called earlier int he week to book the room, I also had to call them the day of arrival to say that there was a cheaper rate on their website, and they did agree to use that rate (a saving of 200 per night!).When we arrived no mention of building work at reception, nothing form the receptionist as she showed us the room, it was only when a maintenance guy arrived to fit a door stop and I asked him what the noise was, he mentioned the work and there should be a letter on the desk form the General Manager! I would have preferred to know in advance!One thing I was very surprised at for such a high class 5* hotel, is it depends on the rate you are on if you get complimentary water left by your bed! I didn't and when I for some, I was told I would have to pay for it!Also slightly surprised you are not allowed to drink alcohol near the lobby while they are serving afternoon tea (with Champagne) at the nearby tables even though at lunchtime I was more than happily served a pre lunch G&amp;T at the very same table! When I mentioned this to the lady who refused to serve me, I was told I was mistaken!! Not all the staff as as pleasant this time round, they must have been having a bad day!The final night we didn't sleep much at all due to what I assumed was noisy neighbors int he upstairs room whop were insomniacs! But it turns out the hotel was having the room above us re-decorated and they work through the night and due to the fact that they remove the carpet, we could hear everything! When I checked out as we were leaving, they lady at the cash desk advised we should not have been in that room at all and if we had told them we would have been moved (Shame as it was our last night, otherwise yes we would have asked to be moved!)I will certainly remember that next time, I will ask if any work is being carried out in the hotel, I want a room no where near it!Other than those minor niggles the weekend was perfect and the weather was wonderful!!"
92,1212,"Apr 7 2007 	A Really Swell Stay	Young, elegant and thoroughly professional staff. Attended to every and all needs. Exquisite rooms, luxurious bath - a great bar - and the lobby area for tea or breakfast is just the tops. Could not have been more well looked after. Especially after an endless overseas flight. P.S. Bring bags of money!"
93,1212,"Mar 23 2007	just wonderfull	In the middle of a fourday stay, this is still one if not the best hotel in london, great room, best grill in town, first class afternoon tea possibly best in london. wondefull chinese restaurant, you cant go wrong."
94,1212,"Feb 6 2007 	Just perfect !	Just spent a wonderful week-end at the Dorchester with my daughter. Everything was so perfect, the room was gorgeous (de luxe twin), massage ( try it, it's worth it !) at the spa, dinner at the Grill ( the menu seems at first a bit &quot;special&quot; for a continental, but it's very original and very good), the baths (ever so deep, a divine experience!) and most of all the service : everybody is there to please you and make you happy, from the minute you are in front of the hotel till the minute you leave, all the staff is ever so kind and helpful. Thank you very much, the Dorchester. Christine from Belgium"
95,1212,"Jan 25 2007 	Lovely hotel	Just returned from a long weekend and decided to try the Dorchester for a change from either the Met or from private clubs. I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews but I had a great rate from the hotel website so I thought I'd give it a try. On arrival in the morning from the overnight flight from the States, my &quot;assigned&quot; room wasn't ready, so I was upgraded to a larger room. The room was beautiful and very well appointed, and the bathroom was even more so. The deepest tub I've ever seen and a great separate shower. If I had one complaint, it woudl be that the satellite tv was very slow and often &quot;frozen&quot;, but that is nothing. The concierge, front desk and room service staff were all wonderful. I had an Eve Lom facial in the spa, which was one of the best I've ever had. The spa did appear to need a little freshening, but not so much so that it detracted from the exerience. All in all, a great experience. I think this hotel suffers from what other higer-end luxury hotels suffer from: unrealistic expectations. An over-critical nit-picker might have negative things to say about the Dorchester, but I found my experience to be one of the nicest I've ever had in London."
96,1212,"Jan 23 2007 	Loved the Dorch	First class all the way. One of the top deluxe London hotels. Overlooking Hyde Park, a few blocks walk to Shepards Market, Tube, but somewhat tucked away from the mainstream tourism. Taxi line at hotel waiting as you exit most times, or arriving within a few minutes. Concierge desk the most helpful in London. The restaurants, bar, and afternoon tea all fabulous; room service extraordinary. Pinch yourself! Only drawbacks are family accommodation; must book a suite or 2 rooms if traveling with 2 children. $$$$Park Lane active, but surrounding streets deserted at night. Safe, but if you can't find a cab you will find yourself walking alone through several blocks late at night when returning from pubs."
97,1212,"Jan 11 2007 	Great to be back at the Dorchester	What a delight to return to one of London's finest hotels. The Dorchester has an excellent location in Mayfair and my King Deluxe room had a view overlooking Hyde Park. The bed-rooms are a comfortable size, luxuriously furnished with superb beds and enormous marble bathrooms. Comfort is key here and everything from the heated towels and fluffly robes to the thick soft carpet is pampering and luxurious. Service at the hotel is outstanding and everyone from the doorman to room service and especially the excellent concierge staff--made me feel welcomed. The Dorchester spa is the finest--and there was nothing better after a good workout to sink into the hot tub or enjoy a steam bath. The Dorchester Grill--with its over the top decor-- was outstanding and worth a visit--even if you are not staying at the hotel. Breakfast was always good, especially room service. The hotel frequently has celebrity and high profile guests and this can be fun or annoying depending on your point of view--but everyone who stays at this fine hotel will feel like a VIP indeed."
98,1212,"Jan 3 2007 	Like a great traditional English pudding...	We moved here following several disappointing stays at the Mandarin Oriental across the park. The Dorchester has a homely, personal feeling which you will not find in a corporate chain like the Mandarin or the Four Seasons. The service is friendly and faultless from the moment you arrive.Room service provides a good range of well presented dishes and once again service is quick, friendly and efficient.The common areas of the hotel are well maintained and extremely traditional, with the highlight being afternoon tea in the Conservatory (make sure you book ahead!). The bar was very smoky due to poor ventilation but that will cease when the long overdue smoking ban comes in this year.There is a great choice of dining options from the tradition of the Grill to the cutting edge oriental cuisine of China Tang.The Rooms? Not overly large for the price but generous enough and you can always upgrade to a sumptuous suite if space is important and (considerable) budget permits. You will feel like you have fallen into a period drama - no stainless steel or black marble in sight! If you want cutting edge, The Metropolitan is 100 yards away but if you want indulgent, comforting luxury with amazing service The Dorchester will feel like home from the minute you arrive."
99,1212,"Nov 8 2006 	Not the Best London Option	Arriving at the well-known Dorchester following a hard week-long slog through Europe on a marketing trip, I was looking forward to a brief (one night) but relaxing stay at this top-bracket property before heading off to Japan. 6 pm check-in was a bit chaotic, but the lobby and first floor is beautiful, and I was finally conducted to what turned out to be a pleasant room, slightly marred by stains on the carpeting and a collection of hairs in the bathtub. It took 2 calls and almost 30 minutes to the porter to have my bags delivered, despite being assured upon check-in that they would be &quot;brought up immediately&quot;. As I was looking forward to a bath, I put in a call to housekeeping to have the bathtub cleaned, but after 20 minutes no one had shown up. After another call and a further 10 minute wait, a perspiring maid finally arrived muttering under her breath whenever the beeper on her belt went off, and cleaned up without enthusiasm. The bathroom fixtures themselves could have used a good polishing, but they worked. Comfortable bed, and very good good room service breakfast. However, the bill for overnight laundry of 5 shirts and underwear tipped the scales at 300 pounds, which seemed a tad high, to say the least.On Saturday, looking to eat lunch at the hotel before heading to Heathrow, I presented myself at the main court only to be told (as expected) that the then empty room was fully-booked for high tea and I would have to look elsewhere. My request for help with where to get a light lunch initially resulted in baffled stares, but ultimately the hotel bar was the recommended alternative. The Dorchester's bar has been written up as &quot;one of the best hotel bars&quot; in London, and if you are looking for a gin and tonic priced at 18 pounds (not including the bottle of tonic, which is extra), thudding eurotrash music, and a strange menu of expensive snacks in a bordello decor, this place is for you. A sloppy wrap of curry chicken salad and one drink set me back over 50 pounds, which is an outrageous price considering what it was. One could do better at the Savoy or Claridges for the same price."
100,1212,"Oct 10 2006 	Not the best hotel in London.	The Front of the building is wonderful, renovations were very good, service was spot on as you would expect. HOWEVER!! we had to move 3 times to get a non smoking room, the smell of old cigarettes was everywhere. After our final move, we woke up on Sunday morning to the smell of cigarette smoke, which was coming under the adjoining bedroom door. Took an hour to check out as they did not take down the correct security number from the credit card."
101,1212,"Sep 11 2006 	Some flaws	Central location, splendid building (after the recent renovations, although I prefered the old Grill and the bar is too modern for my taste) and very luxurious rooms.Dinner at the grill was good but not memorable, and the quality of the service has dropped. Service at the bar was not great, but the waiting staff was especially bad at breakfast in the Promenade. Breakfast itself is also of a lesser quality than in the past (especially the bread) and is now a neglected meal (like at so many hotels).The spa (ok but not a destination in itself) did not look clean (used towels and empty water bottles everywhere). I reported this several times to the reception but it had no effect.The hardware (public areas and rooms) is certainly back where it should be, but there is a problem with the software (poorly trained young waiting staff having replaced the older and distinguished staff)."
102,1212,"Sep 1 2006 	Great!	My partner and I had a two night stay at The Dorchester at the end of August. We were impressed with the checking in service which included the receptionist showing us around the facilities and to our room. Our room was on the second floor. The room was exceptionally spacious and the bed was huge. The bathroom was a decent size with a deep bathtub. (If you had a mobility problem you may not be able to lift your leg high enough to get in) A little disappointingly, our room overlooked the aircon units/kitchen? however, my view is that I do not go to London to spend my time looking out of the window. The new bar was very beautifully done although the prices are definitely London/5* prices! The Promenade is gorgeous and a delight to have either breakfast/ afternoon tea or a late afternoon drink.Our stay inThe Dorchester was very good. We stayed in both The Lanesborough and The Ritz last year and The Dorchester is faring execptionally well in 'our places to stay test'!"
103,1212,"Aug 29 2006 	Lovely Afternoon Tea	A large group of us went for afternoon tea on a Sunday at the Dorchester. On arrival at the hotel I was very impressed with the surroundings and decor. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our tables, which looked beautiful- the china was the finest and daintiest I have seen! The choice of teas were quite bewildering but I finally decided on the Dorchester Blend and was not disappointed. We were firstly served sandwiches, as much as we could eat. I tried most varieties and they were all fantastic! Next came a peach and Vanilla desert- which was followed by warm scones- delicious! We had a selection of pastries which were quickly refilled as I had to try most of them- they were all very tasty! We offered more of everything, although after my second cake I was rather full. The ambience is lovely, a piano playing throughout and even the ladies restrooms were impressive! 10/10 I enjoyed myself immensely as well as the rest of my party- I would love to go again!!!"
104,1212,"Aug 15 2006	Afternoon Tea overpriced.	June, my wife and I went to the Dorchester for Afternoon Tea.Sandwiches were good, desserts were just average and the whole affair was overpriced. Service was slow, our server disappeared and we ended up with someone else.Beautiful setting,,, but as I was about the only man with a necktie, I wondered why I carried it 4000 miles for this...Will go elsewhere next time:"
105,1212,"Aug 7 2006 	Wonderful tea at the Dorchester	I wanted to take my parents to London for the day as a treat. They are comfortably off and are used to some of the nicer things in life, but I'm not - so the budget was important to me. However, I wanted to take them to see Buckingham Palace and then for a smart tea afterwards. I used Tripadvisor and read all the reviews of lots of nice London Hotels which do tea and eventually settled on the Dorchester, mainly because of the reviews which said the staff at the Ritz were condescending to guests. I wanted to my parents to feel special, not unworthy!The best bit was flagging down a taxi and announcing 'the Dorchester' to the driver - my parents were so surprised; they had never been before. We were dropped off outside and the doorman helped us in. The staff inside were courteous and discreet - not snobbish, disinterested or over-the-top. We sat down (the tea area is right inside in the lobby area) and it is beautifully decorated with huge comfortable banquettes or big old-fashioned chairs. A cake stand, silver plate cutlery and tea-strainers, linen cloths and napkins and Limoges crockery were on the table when we arrived. Immediately a waitress came to see if we were ok and said she'd give us a while (which she did twice as we weren't ready.) The only thing which threw me was that another waitress immediately offered champagne, which my parents accepted happily, thinking it was part of the deal - but I hadn't chosen the champagne tea as it was another six pounds each and I'd bought some for later. Anyway, the tea was fantastic. They bought little sandwiches with the crusts cut off - five kinds - and then brought more and more. Unfortunately I ate too many as the pear and stilton one which had sounded so revolting was so nice and I had several. So, by the time the warm scones (plain or with raisins) arrived wrapped in a napkin, I was feeling a little full. The cakes arrived then too, and were a real treat. Some had gold leaf on and all were beautifully presented and tasted lovely. They offered more, and to my eternal and horrified regret I had to decline. A waiter in tails kept topping up the tea, which we thought was great but we realised at the fourth top up that he was just adding boiling water and it was getting weaker and weaker. I had Bangkok tea and it was fabulous! The service was very good and we were surprised to find we'd been there two hours. As we left, I thought we'd go and have a look at the other end of the room just to see what was up there (let's face it, I don't go there every day) and the cocktail bar caught my Dad's eye... he knows I love a cocktail and offered me one. So there we all were having cocktails beautifully prepared by the barman in the Dorchester. It was fantastic and felt so special. As we were leaving, a lady behind the bar offered us a top-up. My mum's always one for a joke and asked if it was free. Yes, she said...so we had another, and it was free, and it was excellent!By the time we left we felt we'd had such a lovely day and the surroundings, decor, ambience (everyone else looked crashingly wealthy and as though having tea at the Dorchester was sooo tedious dahlink) were perfect. I'm really glad I chose this hotel and (if only there weren't so many other places in the world to see!) would be back in a flash. Just fantastic"
106,1212,"Jun 28 2006	Perfect as always	.As a regular at The Dorchester i must comment on the superb service that they provide time after time.On our latest visit, to celebrate a friends birthday,we were informed on arrival that we had been upgraded,we were shown to our room which turned out to be a beautiful park suite.To make sure we made the most of it we invited our friends to join us for lunch in the suite.The six of us had a wonderful lunch over looking Hyde Park before going to an afternoon matinee at the theatre.The staff are always extremely polite and attentive,we have stayed at three or four of the other top hotels in London but for the past few years The Dorchester has been our firm favourite and we highly recommend it."
107,1212,"Jun 24 2006	The Grand Dame of Grand Brittania is outrageously overpriced	A 4 night stay with the wife (left the kids in Chicago with Grandma!) on vacation- exec king set us back $3500 (room, tax, service only). Full breakfast included, thanks to American Express FH&amp;R program. Reasonably spacious room toward the back (read: quiet) of the hotel- two closets in the entry foyer- spacious bathroom with his/her sinks, separate bath and shower. There was also a bidet that provided us with at least several minutes of amusement.The Dorch is on the east end of hyde park, across Park Lane. It is a brisk 5 minute walk to HP since you can't directly cross Park Lane (unless you have a death wish) unless you walk south to the pedestrian underpass. Green Park and Hyde Park tube stops are closest, both about 5 min walk from hotel.Otherwise, there is not much immediately around the dorch- 5 min walk to Shepard's market (a small, socioeconomically normal enclave in the middle of an otherwise outrageously posh Mayfair neighborhood) or Oxford St and a hideously barricaded US Embassy (don't get me started). Kensington (Harrods, etc) is a good 12-15 min walk- but at least you can cut through Hyde Park and the lovely flower gardens along the southeast edge.Had tea at the Dorch- $135/two people. It is unbelievable to me that the English, who readily voice their disdain for loud, tactless Americans, allow constantly ringing cellphones during tea! Shockingly inappropriate, if you ask this ugly american.Meals in general at the D are ridiculously expensive, especially given the overall mediocre quality. We did not eat in The Grill or China Tang- unbelievably pricey. Given the multitude of superb restaurants in London, we pretty much limited ourselves to breakfast.The clientele are an interesting mixture of arabs, tourists, and englishmen wearing tophats (Royal Ascot horse races were happening). We were low-key Americans doing the usual tourist thing in jeans and casual clothing- we definitely stuck out but I didn't feel particularly ostracized. No one ever hassled us, except when we tried to unsuccesfully cut through the back door of the hotel as a &quot;shortcut.&quot; My bad.Service is fine- not outstanding though. Calls to the concierge desk in the middle of the day went unanswered a few times. Maid service was excellent- discrete, fast, and thorough. Check in and check out went fine- they got the bill right on the first try pretty much. Overall, service is comparable to Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, but not as good as Peninsula.Summary: Although the location is considered great, I would suggest that the Dorch is actually a little bit off the beaten path, particularly if you like being able to easily walk (within 5-7 minutes) to restaurants, lounges, shopping, etc. It is outrageously expensive but I am hard-pressed to say it was really worth spending so much for what we hoped would be the quintessential English experience, especially with the constantly ringing cellphones during breakfast and tea. I would stay elsewhere if we went back. P.S. Selfridges is far superior to Harrods- less tourists and WAAAAAYYY less emphasis on their own brand. For example, if you want to buy tea at Harrods, you can really only buy Harrods brand. If you go to Selfridges though, you'll have a ton of choices, only one of which is the Selfridges brand. Selfridges' foodhall is just as impressive as Harrods. Similarly, Selfridges also has an amazing array of clothing, electronics, books, etc. Skip Harrods- Selfridges is a much more entertaining and productive shopping experience with way fewer people to push through."
108,1212,"May 31 2006 	Beautiful Hotel	I stayed at the Dorchester last week and it really is beautifully appointed. The room however, was not what I expected for a top hotel, as it was quite small. The linens were beautiful, the bed comfortable, but the size of the room and the lack of any view was disappointing. All I had to look at really was the ugly top of the roof. The tub, was very deep and the bathroom was fairly large and everything seemed fresh and clean. They are not very generous with toilet paper and fruit plates and at these prices, you should be able to expect more. I never ate at the hotel as the prices were astronomical after the conversion to USD. The lounge area seemed a bit stuffy but the staff for the most part, especially the front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. I might consider staying there again, but be careful where they put you - you'll either be delighted or disappointed. And of course, there was a celebrity sighting- Lionel Ritchie in the lobby."
109,1212,"Apr 16 2006	The Genuine Article	The Dorchester is a seriously good, genuine 5-red-star London hotel. It has lovely, immaculately applied rooms, faultless service, and superb ambience. The whole place has a warm and friendly almosphere. Afternoon tea in the Promenade was a delight, with food as good as you will find anywhere, including the Ritz. The room service breakfast was as excellent, as is the location, with Hyde park across the road, Oxford Street ten minutes walk away, and theatreland just a short cab ride. Anyone looking for a superb, traditional, top-rate London hotel need look no further than the Dorchester."
110,1212,"Apr 10 2006	Absolutely Fabulous	Just got back from staying at this wonderful hotel. From check in to check out our stay was nothing short of perfect. The room was a generous size, absolutely immaculate. The staff were a real pleasure. This hotel definitely deserves its 5 star rating. I have stayed at numerous 5 star hotels around the world and without a doubt I would rank this amongst the best. I have finally found my hotel of choice in London."
111,1212,"Jan 31 2006	Shame about the decor	I have been going to The Grill Room for some time.I enjoyed the tranquil surroundings and the 3 course meal for 38 including service.Very good value for money.when i went in October i was disturbed to find that it was closed for refurbishment.I went back recently.What have they done to the place!The walls are now covered by garish Rob Roy figures,supposedly to highlight the new Scottish influenced menu.Alas this means that the old fixed price menu has gone out and in comes a menu which is almost twice as expensive.There is no longer a desert trolley but you are handed a menu with about 6 desserts from 8.Petite fours and coffee are no longer included and they of course add 12 1/2% service charge on the bill.The food itself is less interesting and i have to say vastly overpriced.So i will not be going back there.So if you think that you are going to get anything special at The Grill Room ,well it will only be the bill.Alas this is no longer a venue i shall visit."
112,1212,"Jan 24 2006	Trouble with payments and truly awful service.	We had tea on sunday afternoon at the dorchester. It was embarassingly bad, really, truly, appalling. Basil Faulty could not have done better!I was especially upset as it had been my idea. I have stayed many times at the dorchester's sister hotels for business, mainly The Principe, in Milan. I have always found it a delight. A respite from mindless business travel with a wonderful friendly staff. It has gorgeous big old fashioned rooms and a truly awesome spa and pool on the top floor. However, even with the fabulous surrondings, it is, to my mind, the staff that make the difference between a good and a great hotel.The Dorchester obviously does not believe this.The staff are arrogant, unpleasant and unhelpful. A previous reviewer put it very well when he said, that the staff regard the guests as a bother. I would concur with this completely.At tea, we were treated as a bunch of annoying idiots. Who were bothering the staff. Imagine, we were so spoilt, we wanted our tea to be served! At nearly 40+ per person for tea, you would have hoped they might make a small effort... Don't count on it. You are upsetting their afternoon by being there. That's how they make you feel.After a few glasses of champagne, we asked for our tea to be served. We would have liked our sandwiches to be brought to the table at roughly the same time as the tea, not when the tea was cold. That didn't happen. When we asked for hot tea we were told it was on its way. By the third time of trying to get some more tea we had to get up and ask the gentleman/manager at the service stand to bring it.We ordered water, again it never appeared. I had to get up, physically stand infront of a waiter and ask for it. Guess what? Yup, it never appeared. The trick is to ask for everything three times, and then it arrives. But actually the really clever bit is finding someone to ask three times! Elusive is obviously a word they learn quickly!When we asked for scones they arrived. We had only asked once! Hurray, it was a blip in the service. It was all going to be fine. Well....no. The scones arrived warm and wrapped in a lovely white linen napkin. Sadly by the time the butter, cream and jam arrived, the scones were cold. The finaly insult was when we tried to pay. The bill arrived very very promptly. I duly handed over my switch card to pay. The man came back and informed everyone at the table, that my card was not acceptable - they don't take solo cards. I pointed out it was a switch card. He went away. He then came back in a loud voice informed us all that it had not been authorised. (I got home and checked my balance online, I had not been wippped out overnight!) So very unlikely, but I'm too old and have stayed in too many hotels, to be bothered by this stuff. Technology cannot always be relied on.So I handed over my Visa card. He swiped it, returned the slip for signing. Then he returned, again, he said my card had not been authorised. Deja Vu! Even though the slip I had in my hand had an authorisation code on it, he said it was not authorised.I just wanted to leave at this point. He became a bit belligerent and annoying and just keep repeating loudly that my card had not been authorised. I asked for my signed slip back, and gave him cash. They would not give me a cash receipt, I even asked him to sign a piece of paper saying he had said received 50 in cash. He would not. Guess what? Yup. I had paid twice, I paid cash, and my visa card has indeed been charged. At the time of writing, I cannot be 100% sure they have not charged my switch card as well, as my bank inform me it can take up to 3/4 days for debits to go through.I have spend a whole morning sorting out a payment for a small amount of money. I have eventually contacted the hotel, G.M., (general manager) and he assures me they are sorting it out. He has, in their defence, been charming, and as good as his word. He has phoned me back, and assures me not only that my card has been credited, but they are crediting me with the cash I paid. So I may, have ended up not paying at all. However, I still feel, it should not have happened in the first place. And when I called yesterday to sort it out, the Food and Beverage Manager should have taken care of it. They didn't. Hence I bounced it up the GM. (Go to the top if there's a problem!)My advice. Go somewhere else. Claridge's is fabulous for tea. The staff are friendly, courteous and charming. Sadly The Dorchester, even with a charming GM, does not deserve our hard earned cash."
113,1212,"Jan 1 2006	Incredible	I am always amazed that people can find something to criticise about the Dorchester. I've been lucky enough to stay there three times and every visit has been exquisite: beautiful rooms, furnished in a classic, English country house style. Incredible, incredible bathrooms. Amazing food. Wonderful service. If you like sleek, modern rooms, you probably won't like the Dorchester. It's chintzy and frilly, the furnishings are oversized and the upholstery florid. But that's because of its style and the hotel's USP - every visit makes you feel like stepping back in time to around 1910. A spotless 1910, I hasten to add.I've always had a room overlooking Hyde Park, which is perfect. But not all rooms have that luxury. That's because you're in a central London hotel, surrounded by shops and offices. I guess some rooms might have a less than perfect view. So request a park view if that bothers you.The rooms aren't massive - unless you have a suite, in which case they're huge -but they certainly aren't mean. And the bathrooms make up for that anyhow. The staff are absolute professionals who take the time to make sure you have a wonderful stay. Which is what you would expect for such a pricey hotel. But if you're in town for a special occasion, there is no finer place to stay."
114,1212,"Dec 18 2005	Just the best....!	We stayed here for 4 nights during October/November and have to say that we were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location. We love to walk and found that all the great tourist places were all around. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a DEluxe King Room which was just great. Heaps of room, roomy bathroom with HUGE bath and VERY comfy bed.The staff are just gorgeous, nothing was to much trouble. We had a bit of an issue with the printer, but they fixed it...even though it meant replacing their computer....!!! I would recommend this hotel to everyone, although it isn't cheap ($900 AUD p/night) it really was worth every cent."
115,1212,"Dec 3 2005	Fabulous - worth every penny!	My fiance took me to The Dorchester to celebrate our engagement. It is fantastic. The service, food, atmosphere.... I couldn't fault a thing. If you have the opportunity, don't think twice and don't miss the afternoon tea!"
116,1212,"Nov 30 2005	Gorgeous hotel gorgeous staff and gorgeous George Clooney..	I stayed here for a long weekend as a surprise from my husband and had I of read the other reviews first I would not have gone.I dont know where you all stayed but The Dorchester was perfect for me, lovely, helpful staff, amazing food and HUGE bed and bathrooms...even better was bumping into George Clooney in THE LIFT!!!The Dorchester is wonderful and if you can afford it go right now!!"
117,1212,"Nov 16 2005	This is not a good hotel it is a Bad hotel. Seriously bad.	The Dorchester is a classic example of what a hotel should not be. The level of service here is very poor. First, upon checking in, I was lectured about why my room wasn't ready (it is not yet check-in time) though I have not only requested an early check-in, but also called from the Heathrow pick-up arranged by the hotel to let them know that I was on the way (during the conversation they confirmed that my room was ready and waiting for me).Security is horrible. A drunken hotel guest was wandering my floor for over an hour, ringing the VERY loud doorbells (further enhancing my jet lag). When I called the frint desk to let then know that I had been awoken four times (and asked if they had security or a camera) I was not given a simple apology.Okay, on to the room. At around $900 US dollars per night, the room is 0 out of 10 on value. The bed is not comfortable, the sheets and pillowcases are starched to the point that they can almost stand on their own. The bathroom is very nice and the honor bar well-stocked. The TV is horrible with two volumes, it seemed: no sound or really loud.Back to the service. Though my inquiries were very few and I am not at all rude (I travel all the time and genuinely like people who work at hotels) the attitude at The Dorchester is that guests are an unwanted bother.Location is good, but not great. There are MANY better-situated hotels to the city center. The fitness room is fair at best. Very small, poor TVs, aging equipment.Finally, the hotel has a smell. It smells...old...like your grandmother's house when she's either too infirm to tend to it or getting too old to care.This is NOT a good hotel. Take the huge sack of money required to stay here and go elsewhere."
118,1212,"Nov 1 2005 	great bath tub but the room is the luck of the draw	We stayed at The Dorchester for two nights, courtesy of the BAFTA awards. The front desk staff wasn't very accommodating. When we were shown to our room I have to say I was a bit shocked. The hallways were very dismal and claustrophobic. our room was unremarkable. The view out the one small window was of a roof sandwiched in between an alcove of the exterior of the hotel. In other words we had no view and no light coming in the room. The carpet was dirty and basically the furnishings felt very worn. I asked the front desk if they could switch us to another room and they said no. We offered to pay the difference for an upgrade and again they said no. so we settled in and I basically spent my time in the room asleep or in the wonderful big marble bath tub. we visited two other rooms while we were in the hotel. One was far worse than ours. The other was absolutely gorgeous. I suppose it's typical of older hotels for the rooms to vary so much. But all I could think about was the crummy room we were stuck in and the gorgeous one we could have had. I do have to say that the location was great and the concierge was one of the nicest I have ever come across. I would, however, stay at The Claridges down the street and around a few corners. That was a great hotel."
119,1212,"Sep 19 2005 	Its the best in London.	The afternoon tea is better than the Ritz, even though you have to squat on low chairs. All round its better. The Spa is first rate. Good barbers and excellent hairdressers.The security is ham-fisted. They are pretty obvious if your aware and if they can't make you out, they 'talk' to you out of the blue. Kinda strange at first, but after they recognise you (if you visit more than once) your OKed.Taking about the Doorman, he actually made a quip about where I was going when he pulled the cab over, as if to say &quot;Now we know where you go&quot;.What do expect with the bombings and superstar guests, the security have got to be on their toes."
120,1212,"Aug 17 2005	Afternoon Tea - an addendum	My wife and I had afternoon tea at the Dochester and would echo all the plus points of the previous review. However, we disagree over the 'pastries'. They were exquisitely made (apparently in-house) and were just as much a delight to the tastebuds as they were to the eyes. A truly marvellous experience."
121,1212,"Aug 10 2005	Afternoon tea 	Myself and 2 friends went for afternoon tea at the Dorchester last Friday. We debated at length on which of the Grand Dames hotels to pick. WIth very few reviews on TripAdvisor to help us!On arrival we were very pleased with the sumptious surroundings - tea is taken not in the foyer, but a long wide room off the foyer with a glamorous bar at the end. So you are not disturbed by comings and goings. The decor is very grand, the carpets so deap we could feel our shoes sink into them. The tables are set spaciously apart so we were not sitting on top of others. We had a table next to the piano player who played a mix of ballads and light classical. The bone china and cutlery were quite modern in design. My friends are both 30 and were the youngest there. The average age was about mine - mid-40s - 50. It was near full, but still exquisitely calm and peaceful.The tea menu was amazing - I had the finest Early Grey I have ever had. My friends adored their darjeeling. All fresh leaves. Then came the sandwiches - finger style with simple but delicious fillings: chicken, prawn, smoked salmon, egg, and cream cheese and cucmber. The waitress graciously placed a selection on our plate, and came back - we could have had as much as we wanted. Then came warm freshly baked scones (2 each), clotted cream and delicious home made tasting blackberry and strawberry jams. Plus fresh pots of tea and clean cups.Then the disappointment. I was expecting English cakes and cream cakes - sort of typical classic cream Victoria sponges etc. But what came were dinky continental patisseries, obviously not made in house. Now the chocolate covered one with a cherry inside was lovely. But not an English classic cake in sight. The dinky macaroon was pointless, and then a couple of mousse type patisseries which we didn't enjoy. This was the big disappointment. And we noticed that everyone had exactly the same cakes at their tables.The staff were grace and pleasantness personified, and we were offered seconds and more of everyhting. But the disappointmet of the cakes took the edge off.One of my friends is an avid afternoon tea goer. She rated the surroundings of the Dorchester the best she had seen. Not stuck in a foyer. But the one let down to her was the cakes! She said even though the Ritz's surroundings were not as grand, it still had the edge because of the cakes. The bill was 81 for 3. Cheaper than the Ritz - but who cares when it's a treat? Then the big bonus. We had arrived at 3.00pm. On leaving I checked my watch - it was 6.00pm! Yet we felt we had only been there for about 1 hour! It was so calm, relaxed, and lovely, time had melted away. The quiet hush of the patrons, the gorgeous surroundings, and the calm service of the staff meant that time had melted by. We felt incredibly relaxed and that we had had very good value - a real treat. Not many restaurants at lunch for about 27 a head would allow you to sit for 3 hours! No one rushed us - it was definitely NOT get them in and get them out, we need the table for another party.One other oddity: the seating. I had a wing chair, my friend who was pregnant a couch, but our other friend had a large stool. As did other guests. But a very comfy and padded antique stool. She loved it!Overall, this was a wonderful experience that I will repeat and would recommend. But not if you what you really really want are English cream cakes or classic cakes and don't care about the sandwiches, scones, surroundings and piano playing!"
122,1212,"Aug 8 2005	poor choice	Stayed here at the time of the second London bombing. A disappointment. Hotel was undergoing extensive refurbishment, with workers everywhere. At check-in, the hotel attempted to put us in a smoking room and initially made a fuss when we objected. Then they attempted to charge us a higher rate than our guaranteed reservation. Fortunately, having a print out of the reservation solved that - except that they then tried to re-institute the higher charge at check out! Dated decor and a dated clientele. Not a patch on other luxury hotels - Four Seasons just down the road has much nicer rooms and a more friendly staff. Not recommended, and we won't go back."
123,1212,"Jul 25 2005	Almost excellent	I stayed at the Dorchester late May 2005. I booked a standard room through the LHW-website. When I checked in I was upgraded to a larger deluxe room, which was a very nice room overlooking Hyde Park. I loved the room: large and good bed, sitting group and a large bathroom. The room was spacious. And the in-room entertainment system was genious. The service the employes provide is one of the best in Europe. The atmosphere of the hotel is casual and good. I ordered some food from the roomservice, and the portions was among the largest and most generous I have ever seen in the hotel business. I even catched a sight of both Goldie Hawn and Mickey Rourke in the hotel lobby.However, when I was returning to the hotel one night I was approached by a man from security who in a rude way asked me if he could help me with something. This made me kinda angry, because I don't accept to be treated like this in establishments such as the Dorchester. I told the duty manager and the general manager about this, and they promised to handle this in a proper way. Which they did. Overall, I am very satisfied, and would really recommend the Dorchester to anyone who truly appreciate good service and luxury. But for all those who appreciate the little extra I recommend Claridge's. Which is my favourite hotel in London."
124,1212,Jul 14 2005	Wow! Excellent service fabulous food beautiful room!	This is by far the best hotel I've ever stay in for vacation. The service was top notch. Food both in their restaurant and room service was wonderful.Would highly recommend and stay there again.
125,1212,"May 26 2005	Beautiful hotel but surprisingly bad service	Sad to be the only one to have received a poor standard of service at this beautiful and luxurious hotel.My problems occurred before and after leaving the hotel - the service during my stay was wonderful. The staff are attentive, the rooms are luxurious, the atmosphere is stuffy but not stifling.Unfortunately, the online booking system encountered some errors when I booked my room. Despite receiving confirmation for one price, I was told I'd be charged another. This necessitated a phone call to the hotel, who advised they would honour their original confirmation. Had a great stay. Met with some friends from the US and Ireland. On check-out the bill was incorrect due to aforementioned 'problem with the computer system'. Found it annoying to be stood at the cashiers desk whilst waiting for them to sort it out. They did, I left on my merry way.That evening, on my return home, I realised that I had left two items in my room when hurriedly departing. Jacket and ring. Phoned immediately and reported it. Retrieved jacket, NO ring. Called several times to check status of ring. Was advised that it had not been found and was unlikely to be found. Seemed a rather unsatisfactory response and wrote letter to the general manager. However, I do realise that this was partly an error on my part as I left it in the room.Meanwhile, before receiving a reply about my ring, I received an invoice for 340.00, which was taken off my credit card (three weeks after I checked out). This was all in ERROR. I had paid my bill on departure. Due to (once again) a system malfunction, they had taken another nights accommodation off my credit card. Absolutely appalled that they had retained my credit card details and charged it without my knowledge. Since then there has been endless calls to the hotel and manager expressing dissatisfaction with their service, yet not one gesture of goodwill has been made except some rather lame apologies from about a million members of staff (NOT the manager). And still no ring. I know it's considered wonderful that The Dorchester has 3 members of staff per guest, however it means that maintaining a complaint with them is next to impossible.I am supposed to be visiting there later this year for another reunion, but I'm loathe to do so, despite how wonderful a time I had there in May. Considering the cost of staying at The Dorchester compared with other 5* hotels in London, it is appalling how bad their service is."
126,1212,"Mar 25 2005 	My Favorite Hotel in the World	How else to say it? The Dorchester is my favorite hotel in the world. It combines beauty, elegance, and outstanding service with a surprisingly friendly and unpretentious attitude. Whenever I arrive, I am welcomed as a repeat visitor, both at the front desk and with a note from the manager (and fruits and sweets) in my room. On the rare occasion when something is amiss, they simply take care of the problem with good cheer. To cite just one example, on one trip my television went on the fritz. When they determined that it would take a little while to fix it, they offered to move me to a suite. When I demurred on the grounds that moving my things probably wasn't worth the troubles, they offered to buy me a drink in the (very fun) bar and relocate all of my possessions to precisely the same spot, drawer, nightstand, etc. in the new room, which they did. Beyond the great service, it's in a wonderful location near Hyde Park and Mayfair; the rooms are beautifully furnished in classic English style; the bathrooms are elegant and spotless; it has excellent restaurants; and it even has a good health club and excellent spa."
127,1212,"Mar 15 2005 	Fabulous experience!	My husband and I stayed at The Dorchester Hotel February 24-27, 2005. We had wonderful experiences each day. The staff was totally helpful...making us feel like very special guests indeed! No request was denied. The food (especially the breakfast) was excellent. We especially loved the bar....music, interesting people-watching and great drinks! We stayed in the deluxe King room and we impressed with the fabulous linens, etc. The location in Mayfair is perfect for walking everywhere. Beautiful Hyde Park is right across the street and the flowers are beginning to bloom!"
128,1212,"Mar 5 2005	Service beyond expected	I would like to share this story as an example of the wonderful service at the Dorchester. At about 2AM on our first night my wife and I were awakened by sounds above our room. It was as though someone was dragging something across the floor and dropping it periodically. This lasted possibly ten minutes and stopped. On the second night, we were again awakened by the same sound at a similar time. I called the office slightly after 2AM to report the noise... perhaps they could ask the people in the room above to be a bit quieter. After a brief pause, the manager came to the phone. &quot;There is no one in the room above you.&quot; He asked if we could meet him in the hall outside our room in a few minutes. Within 5 minutes he was there with two people who moved us to a new room at 2:30 in the morning. The room was a VERY high priced suite and absolutely gorgeous. There were no additional charges for the upgrade for the remainder of our 6 day stay. We had asked for none of this and will never forget how well we were treated at one of the greatest hotels in the world."
129,1212,"Feb 25 2005	Gorgeous decor fantastic knowledgeable staff	My friend and I popped into the hotel bar for a cocktails. The service was wonderful (and at 11 per drink you would hope so!) and the cocktails were lovely. We were served lots of nice nibbles (aka snacks) and a lounge singer and piano player performed.As we were leaving, I asked the concierge which tube station was the closest. He asked me which line I needed, and he was able to tell me which station (to save me changing tube lines)I was impressed all around."

1,1223,"Nov 14 2009 	Great affordable hotel in a perfect location	What a great hotel for a reasonable price. My room is lovely - quiet, good size and spotlessly clean. Everything is very modern and the showerroom is fab. I particularly liked the Club lounge where you can browse the internet and have tea and coffee for no extra charge. The real beauty is the location. It's so central and you can walk to so many of the good tourist spots. The only downside is that the hotel doesn't have a restaurant although I believe that is in progress at the moment. Highly recommended!"
2,1223,Oct 21 2009 	Perfect retreat in the heart of the city	I stayed in this hotel last month and was incredibly pleased with everything. I was in a 'single' room but it was the equivalent of a double room in a regular London hotel. The reception is vast and clean and inviting. Just outside of the bustle of Trafalgar Square this is a classy hotel where anyone can feel welcome. The quality of the room was fantastic and I had a great night sleep in a comfortable (great quality) bed. I believe they're currently redoing the restaurant to be open soon but until then there are menus available for restaurants that deliver to the hotel. There are restaurants locally too of course!I used to stay in chain-hotels during my London visits but I'm hooked on this one and will be staying there again soon.
3,1223,"Oct 15 2009 	great staff fantastic location and very fine room!	By far the best experience I could ask for. I was not seeking luxury; I just wanted a quiet good quality place to stay downtown, and The Grand is GRAND! I stayed on the 9th loor and I could see and hear Big Ben (but no street noise nor sound from neighboring rooms). The place is beautifully kept and extremely comfortable. What a fine place to stay right in the heart of London."
4,1223,"Oct 12 2009 	Location can't be beat	Definitely a business hotel, but the location is so good that it will work for anyone. We stayed a week, and had no complaints at all. Room was modern and more spacious than what you usually get in London. We were on the street side, but high enough up so that the noise was not an issue at all."
5,1223,"Oct 9 2009 	Can't wait to go back!	I was VERY pleased with the location being right in the heart of Trafalgar Square. The hotel was a short walk to several different tube stations and bus stops around every corner. The hotel was off a side street but you could see Trafalgar square if you walk out the hotel doors. Inside, the atmosphere was very business like. I was traveling with my husband so the lack of children was very nice. The room was very clean however the maids came at strange times, afternoon/evening hours. They offered free use of outlet adapters, which was nice since we are from the US and our pc power cords would not work without an adapter. Our flight arrived early am and we arrived at the hotel at about 9 am. They were kind enough to let us into our room very shortly after arrival even though check in was not until 3 pm, without any additional charge. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone going to London."
6,1223,"Sep 21 2009 	Can't beat the location but it's defintely a 3 star hotel	The location of the Grand is perfect for anyone who wants to walk London. Westminster is a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Buckingham Palace is a 20 min walk. Shopping off Oxford St and Picadilly is also within a 15-20 min walk. The amenities are lacking, however. For example, there's no restaurant in the hotel, and the room service menu wasn't appetizing. The vending machines on the third floor (good luck finding them) also didn't work. We found our shower flooded the bathroom every morning and had to ask for soap from the staff. This hotel is definitely a three star. As long as you set your hotel room amenity expectations appropriately and hotel location is you #1 priority, you'll enjoy your stay."
7,1223,"Sep 17 2009 	Perfect Stay for Young Traveler	My friend and I, both 22, took a trip through Europe after we graduated college. The first leg of our trip was to London, and staying at The Grand was an amazing way to start. Recommend 100%. I am type A and spent a lot of time being really particular and picky about where to stay and this place was the best choice!!!!First, we took the tube straight from Terminal 4 at Heathrow. Take the Piccadilly Line and Transfer to Circle or District Line to Embankment station. Literally a 3 minute walk later, you will find yourself at the hotel. When we arrived, we were kindly greeted and check in took maybe 5 minutes. Our room was amazing! Really comfortable bed with great sheets and pillows. High ceilings and windows, great, clean bathroom. We relaxed for maybe 20 minutes after our flight and headed straight out. One thing that definitely cool in London was getting a trip for the double decker tourist bus. This way you can learn about what you're seeing, and it includes a free river cruise (they serve beer on the cruise btw!!) We asked the front desk, and we were able to buy tickets straight with them. Even better, the bus stopped around the corner next to Pret a Manger. AND you get FREEE bottles of water to take with you from the hotel! We had WiFi and a free computer on our floor which was definitely a plus, to keep in touch with everyone back home.Step outside and you will find yourself in the center of London! We walked everywhere!!! Except Kensington or Harrods, that's what the bus was for. We took 2 trips just around the city on the bus and would get on and off randomly. NIGHTLIFE is RIGHT THERE!!! 10 minute walk to all the pubs in covent garden as well as clubs in soho and west end. Because trafalgar square is with people all the time we weren't scared to walk home at 3 am, and we even got dinner at 2 am and just hung out in trafalgar. Overall, amazing stay in London. This hotel really made the beginning of trip and it definitely helped us get to St. Pancras station on our ride over to Paris."
8,1223,"Sep 16 2009 	Absolutely horrible service	We stayed here for six days. The location is fabulous - close to the Tube, to all the major sites, and that is probably the best part of this hotel. I'm surprised it's ranked at 56 in the London hotels, and i suppose it's because of the good price and the good location. But the hotel itself, despite its revamped look and renovations, once you go beyond the surface, is cheap, and with horrible service. The internet connecton is one of the reasons I chose the hotel, and 4 out of 6 days it was not working. Concierge service was non existent and when i asked for help looking for certain things i was given wrong directions (ie. sent to a restaurant that we spent 20 min walking to, only to find it had gone out of business a year ago!). Staff were NOT helpful, and when we arrived nobody helped us with our bags or even asked. We had a moth in our room one night - flapping about in the light fixture, an di didnt want to be blamed for damaging the fixture so called the hotel staff. They sent some effeminate young asian man who stood there scared out of his wits telling us he couldnt do anything because it was &quot;a live animal&quot;. They also said they had no rooms to transfer us to, and then told us &quot;we have no idea what to do&quot;. It was ridiculous. Almost laughable (we laughed afterwards), but at the time absolutely frustrating and anger inducing. Finally some decent handyman showed up and tried to find the moth but by tha ttime it had hidden itself elsewher (we found and killed it on our own the next day, it was the size of my fist!)anywyay...we travelled Europe for ONE MONTH and this was the worst hotel. I was surprised too, i honestly expected it would be very good considering it was a minute from Trafalgar Square."
9,1223,"Sep 14 2009 	great location great hotel !	I enjoyed my stay here very much. Room was very clean, appropriate and i liked the fact that the staff previewed a little closet for guest self service, meaning that if i needed sugar, cream, coffee or a needle, i could go get it myself in the little closet - very smart! The only two things that are negative in this hotel are: 1) the whole hotel is made of wood which is awful because you hear everything that goes on upstairs. a group of jerks came back from a party at around 3 am slamming doors and walking with elephant steps and we had to call the reception for them to go say something! 2) there is no breakfast possibility and that is awful! who doesn't love breakfast? every room (well at least ours) had a little kettle and powder coffee, sugar, tea, etc so we had coffee with cookies in the morning... acceptable and cheaper but i would consider offering the possibility of breakfast to guests... continental please!voil, otherwise, GREAT hotel !"
10,1223,"Sep 14 2009 	Just Fine!	Nice rooms, not minimalist but contemporary room design. No breakfast. Decent place to have meetings on the 2nd floor, and there are conference/rooms meeting rooms in the basement."
11,1223,"Sep 1 2009 	Fabulous location and such a comfortable room	Such a wonderful location - right off Trafalgar Square. It could not be more convenient for Trafalgar Square, Whitehall or Charing Cross station.The room was wonderful, comfortable, clean and spacious. The bed was soooo comfortable - unlike so many hotels. There is a 24 hour Tesco direct about 20 yards away to buy any food, wine or supplies needed.Would definitely stay here again and got a good deal through the Trip Advisor search engines."
12,1223,"Aug 24 2009 	Good Location But Breakfast Not Included	Be careful, breakfast is not included in the price of the room and is very expensive. 5 for a glass of OJ or a cup of Coffee. For the same price you can get a full breakfast in the &quot;Garfunkel's&quot; cafe just yards up the road.When we made our reservation there was no mention that the rate was roon-only and as such assumed breakfast was included (Every other hotel I have stayed in breakfast was included unless otherwise stated).This hotel is very much geared towards the business traveller, good for a weekend break, but I wouldn't spend a week here.Apart from that the location is perfect for a weekeend visit to london and even though it is only yards from Trafalgar square the street itself is not busy at all which means the rooms are very quiet. Charing Cross and Embankment tube stations are also yards away and between them you can get to anywhere in London. The London eye is a 5-minute walk away.The cold water and ice despencing machine on each floor were very handy when sightseeing. The national Gallery is on the oppsosite side of trafalgar square to the hotel and free entry."
13,1223,"Aug 21 2009 	Location Location Location	Would I stay there again? Yes. Would I recommend to family and friends? Yes.Why? You're half-a-block from Trafalgar. If you are in London to site-see this is the Hotel. Alot of the reviews complain about size and the luxury of the hotel. Your in London! If I wanted to stay in a luxury hotel, I could find one a lot closer to home. The rooms were clean, no bathtub, but who wants to take a bath in a hotel anyway? Rooms reminded me of a small Best Western Hotel that you can find throughout the American West. Clean but nothing to write home about. For average Americans traveling to London you are not going to find a better deal.You can walk to everything and Embankment Station is a block away.Location, Location, Location. Step out your door and there is London. The London you are there to see."
14,1223,"Aug 19 2009 	Comfortable room	The hotel seems to have fallen on hard times: a &quot;grand&quot; hotel with an echoing, empty lobby. Once you find the desk, though, the perfectly polite staff (the motivated young foreigners you find all over London) sends you up to well-furnished rooms. We didn't need the kitchen space for our overnight stay, but I was won over by the selection of reference books furnished in the room (what would I do without a dictionary and thesaurus in hand's reach). Remarkably quiet room for central London, and the &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot; in the name is not false advertising: it's a minute's walk to the corner."
15,1223,"Aug 16 2009 	Great location - less than desired hotel accomodations	If your plan is to see London, this is an ideal location. It is in the heart of central London. However, if your plan is to see London and enjoy a nice hotel - this is not the place. Everything you might need is here, but in small quantities.If you leave the bathroom door open, you can't leave the room. If you leave the Armoire door open, you can't get to the bathroom and certainly not out the door - get the picture! Ice, pure water, and ironing board are shared commodities located in the middle of the floor near the lifts.I recommend only for those wishing to visit London and not expect an &quot;American Sized&quot; hotel room. And as for view? I think you have to pay extra."
16,1223,"Aug 13 2009 	A bit ""cheap""	This is a decent hotel that is completely updated, but with no frills. It was clean and adequate, but lacked any services. Our room was clean and modern, but the bathroom looked as if it was an afterthought added in the corner of the room. A hotel computer was provided free of charge, but the internet connection was horribly slow. The restaurant was not open yet. Towel service was extraordinarily slow. Probably the best feature of this hotel was its location right down the street from Trafalgar Square. The hotel was a good value, but just don't expect to be wowed. Once you scratch the surface, you realize there is an air of a cheapness here."
17,1223,"Aug 10 2009 	Outstanding location!	Recently stayed at the Grand. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the grand exterior and outstanding location. If you are looking for a decent hotel which is in easy reach of most of London's attractions then this is the place! It is a minutes walk from Trafalgar Square, up the road from the Thames (and across from the London Eye), around the corner from Westminster which includes Big Ben, Downing Street etc. Located next to most of the theatres and down the road from Charing Cross Train Station. This is only to mention a few. The location is EXCELLENT! The hotel is small and I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the amenities and the size of the room. The room is small and shall we say cosy? We requested a fridge to be put into the room, however, this seemed to be a problem but four hours later a fridge arrived, it didn't work. There are stations on each floor where you can get fresh water and ice and stock up on the tea and coffee. The bathroms are small and only include a shower (powerful) and generally the rooms are very clean. I would not recommend the breakfast at the hotel 16 for a full english! Instead go to Garfunkels, only 30 seconds from the hotel and get a large english breakfast for two for the same price as one in the hotel's restaurant. There is also a Tesco on the corner next door to Garfunkels. The location cannot be faulted! Overall, I would stay here again. There is a fitness room if you need any more exercise after walking around London and the rooms are generally ok. You can upgrade to suites each night for generally 25 so maybe those rooms would have been more spacious? The price of suites will be advertised on the check-in desk. The staff are generally helpful yet a little distant. They would be described as efficient and professional. Overall a nice stay at The Grand, but for me, the location made it worth it. If you would like to see as much of London as possible in a short time, seriously consider The Grand!"
18,1223,"Aug 3 2009 	Very good location a good base for a weekend in London	For me, this was almost a perfect stay (minus the billing). The hotel is well located close to Trafalgar Square at a reasonable price. It's also close to the pier for the O2 express (I was in London for a concert in O2 and found that the express boat was the best way to get there).The single room was a bit small, but modern and very clean - and for a laptop user, very well equipped (complementary wi-fi/wired internet, monitor cable for the flat screen tv, sound cable for a laptop or mp3-player etc). Safe big enough for a mini laptop, coffee/tea maker in the room, iron/board, extra coffee/tea and chilled water to the rooms available in corridors. The room was air conditioned. The only downside was that the window was facing an opposite wall that was quite close, so there was absolutely no view, but that was quite alright for me, there was enough room to get daylight in anyway.Leaving the hotel, I was in a hurry to the airport, and did not notice, that they charged the VAT over the VAT inclusive price, so I ended up paying the VAT twice. I emailed them a couple of days later, and they corrected the mistake and refunded my credit card, so in the end, everything was ok.Definitely would stay here again."
19,1223,Jul 31 2009	Can't Be Beat!!	My daugher and I stayed a week at the Grand and really loved it. The front desk personnel were always there but low key which is what I prefer. My favorite feature is the free filtered water service near elevator. What a savings and so convient to grab some cold water on my way out. We felt very safe walking the streets even at night. This was our first trip to London and I couldn't be more impressed. I would definitely like to return.
20,1223,"Jul 23 2009 	The BEST location in London!	My husband and I traveled to London for the first time and were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. The hotel seems like more of a business hotel, however for our stay (7 nights), it was perfect. The location couldn't have been better. You are within walking distance to many of the main attractions that London has to offer. The rooms were nicely sized and very clean. A nice touch was the free water, which I had read about before staying there. It really came in handy on our daily ventures out and about. Our room also had a fridge, sink area, and microwave. The restaurant Prezzo, across the street from the hotel, is a great option if you get hungry and want some decent Italian food. There is also a more chain type restaurant, Garfunkels, which is also quite good. At the end of the street is a 24 hour market which we used quite a bit. St. James Park was located about five minutes away. It is such a nice park that one could spend the day there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others who may be traveling to London for the first time. I would stay there again without a doubt."
21,1223,"Jul 22 2009 	Superb Location	Stayed for 2 nights at this hotel with my girlfriend as we were going to see Chicago the musical and also wanted to do some sightseeing. The location i simply cannot fault. If you exit the underground at Charing Cross station, the hotel is a 2 minute walk away (and that includes time for crossing the roads!). There are loads of cafes, restauraunts and coffee shops nearby and most major tourist attractions are within easy walking distance (e.g. London Eye, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Parliament, Buckingham Palace and of course Trafalgar Square etc etc). Anything else is catered for simply by catching the underground.The hotel itself featured a quick self check in, pleasant staff and was very clean. We stayed in room 307 which we found clean, spacious and quiet. A big plus was the walk in shower, which provided plenty of power after a hard days' sightseeing. When visiting London in the past we've usually stayed in the Premier Inn, County Hall next to the London Eye, which, although excellent in itself has one major flaw........no air conditioning. The Grand at Trafalgar square however, does not suffer with this problem. With the recent hot and stuffy spell of weather we've been experiencing, coming back to the lovely cool room was pure bliss. Another point to mention is that the air con unit was quiet, unlike some hotels where the units shake, rattle and roll and keep you awake at nights!One very useful thing i must point out is that the hotel provides free chilled water on each floor. There are even plastic bottles provided for you to fill up. This was a nice touch.We booked the hotel for a very reasonable rate and, considering the excellent, central location, it was all the more reasonable. Will definitely be staying here again."
22,1223,"Jul 6 2009 	fantastic	great hotel, great location. down side no fridge in the room. Staff very helpful and friendly."
23,1223,Jul 3 2009 	Club Quarters Rock!	We stayed at the Club Quarters. Booked a regular room then upgraded to Club Suite for additional 25 pounds on check in - they have a little board showing upgrades availabe for that night and cost - Brilliant!Everything was great and price very reasonable for such a fabulous location - you can walk just about anywhere.Recommend drinks at the Sherlock Holmes over the road and breakfast at the National Gallery restaurant.
24,1223,"Jul 3 2009 	Great location otherwise would never stay here again	Its true about location, fanstastic and in itself enough to warrant serious consideration. That aside, the staff at front desk were fanstastic but the hotel itself, which looks luxurious is actually not. Its very basic room with formica type counters and particle board desk built into the walls. No mini bar and room service, beers included ends at 11pm so if you get back from full day and looking for something, forget it. This is unacceptable for any hotel that claims to be an upscale hotel. Beds were hard and linnens basic. Lobby of course looks great but there is no real public place to go to other than a bar. Its not a large hotel with lots of public spaces. This place would never make it if it didnt have the location it does."
25,1223,"Jun 30 2009 	Simply the best place to stay when in London!	We have stayed in the Grand at trafalgar square three times so far and would not think of staying anywhere else.10/10 for location10/10 for value10/10 for facilities.There is a 24 hours tesco on the corner, many bars and restaurants, all the sites on you doorstep. So easy to find your way about from this central point and many extras in this sleek hotel including free bottled water (I think free internet) great order in service, flat screen tv, movies on demand, great clean, elegant rooms.I can't think of anything more you could want and you can get some great rates also. The first time we got a queen room which was fantastic though the standard rooms we got the last two times were lovely too.I really recommend this hotel and can find no fault with it at all! Really great for a romantic weekend away or shopping break."
26,1223,"Jun 30 2009 	The Best Value For The Money In London	I booked this hotel on line and had no personal reference to go by. I booked for the location, but was concerned about the quality of the hotel based on the price of the rooms. When the taxi drove up I thought I was at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, what an amazing surprise. Once inside, the lobby was beautiful, the staff were extremely helpful and my room was ready even though I arrived before noon. The rooms were large and equipped with everything you would need, including electronic A/C controls and free internet access. The bathroom was much bigger than expected, with mirrors everywhere, a huge shower and it was spotless.The location was more than perfect. We walked to the Horse Guard in five minutes, to Buckingham Palace in 10 minutes, the theatre in 15 minutes, the Tube in two minutes and the Charing Cross train station in five minutes. The tour busses were available in front of the hotel and it was the best value I have ever had in Europe."
27,1223,"Jun 24 2009 	Unbeatable location	The major selling point of this hotel is its fabulous location, situated a few minutes walk from Trafalgar Square in one direction and the Embankment tube station in the other. Theres also a 24hour convenience store a short walk away, which is brilliant for drinks, sandwiches and fresh pastries, and a pub right across the road. We arrived well before the stated check-in time and were prepared to leave our bags off and come back later but the friendly member of staff behind reception checked us in immediately with no problems, showing us how to use the self-service check-in, which works much like an ATM. Our room was clean and quite large for London standards, with a comfortable double bed, an easy chair and a desk with a computer chair. The closet was small and awkwardly placed in the corner; however it did contain removable hangers, a hairdryer and an umbrella, (which thankfully we didnt need!) There was also a selection of books about London on the shelf. The bathroom was bright and had a wonderful shower, although the room tended to steam up easily. The bathtowels were also on the small side, but they were replaced every day. The TV also had a selection of music to listen to, which was a nice touch, but it was also supposed to have free internet access with a wireless keyboard supplied in the drawer, but this didnt work during our entire stay. When I asked at reception if anything could be done, I was told to try turning it off and on again, and failing that, to use the computer in the lounge on the second floor. However, there was only one computer in this room and when I went to use it later than night there were three people waiting beside it. There was no offer of a complementary use of the Club Library  perhaps because I dont look like a businessman.The ice and complimentary water on each floor is a wonderful idea , as is the guest closet, however this promised extra bedding and pillows should guests require them but during our stay only ever contained an itchy-looking blanket. We had minimal contact with staff, but when we did speak to them they were pleasant and always said hello, even the cleaning staff. We had no problems using the air-conditioning, however the fan was very noisy and took a while to turn off once you pressed the button  you probably couldnt sleep with it on. We had a room towards the front and so were able to hear traffic and sirens all through the night, although this wasnt the hotels fault. Checking out was as simple as checking in. For the location alone, this hotel would be hard to beat."
28,1223,"Jun 23 2009 	Perfect location	The location right beside Trafalgar Square is the biggest selling point of this hotel.It would be extremely difficult to find a more central place to stay.Our favourite area in London is along the river and this is the closest we have ever managed to stay to the Embankment area.I have no complaints about the hotel which was exactly as described ,with a larger than normal room for London.However although it was a studio room with fridge &amp; microwave,cutlery and crockery were not supplied.A quick trip to M&amp;S got us picnic bowls &amp; cutlery for 3.The hotel may have supplied things if asked but as we didn't ask I can't say.No use repeating all the nice things others have said.Suffice to say we will stay again on our next visit to London."
29,1223,"Jun 22 2009 	Fabulous!	I stayed just one night at The Grand.Friendly staff helped me with the electronic check in. Room was a nice size (especially for London) we had no trouble with outdoor noise, air conditioning was quiet too. very clean and modernly decorated. A staff member came to check that everything was ok and asked whether we needed anything too which was nice. Breakfast was included served in the restaurant downstairs, selection of pastries, eggs, bacon toast or cereal. If breakfast isnt included i wouldnt pay for it, there are plenty of much cheaper options nearby.Location is unbeatable for this hotel, its literally steps away from Trafalgar square, 5 mins on the tube from Euston Station.We walked to Covent Garden in 10 mins and is perfectly located for theatres and shopping and the sightseeing tours. There is free internet available on the 2nd floor, also free bottled water at various stations in the hotel which was handy. Tons of restaurants, shops, bars within a minutes walk. The area was still really busy on a Tuesday evening around 11pm and we felt safe walking around the area."
30,1223,"Jun 22 2009 	Club Quarters is wonderful	Club Quarters Trafalgar Square is brilliant. Super efficient checking in and checking out facilities, free coffee, internet access and bottled water. The location was perfect with tube stations right outside the hotel and a little Tescos at the end of the street to pick up a few groceries.Clean rooms and our room had a microwave and fridge. Quiet rooms because the hotel is located down a side street . All in all a wonderful stay!"
31,1223,"Jun 13 2009 	What a great stay in London at the Club Quarters!	I recently stayed at the Club Quarters, Rockefeller Center, for one night in the spring. I was overwhelmed by my stay there and decided to try to get a room at the Club Quarters, Trafalgar Square. I think that this is one of the best locations that I have every been to in London for its access to so many interesting parts of town. I did, however, make a big mistake when I booked my hotel. When I saw the price (129), I thought that I had seen $, instead of . That made a big difference in my price, especially with the 15% V.A.T. added. For three nights, I had to pay the equivalent of $630. That is a lot for a teacher, but I loved mostly every moment of my stay here. When I arrived, I was offered a free pass to the CLUB LOUNGE (for members only) on the first floor. I assumed that this was for the entire stay. After one day, the key no longer worked. This lounge and its snacks and hot drinks was one of the reason that I loved being here on the first day. This is a tactic that the hotel is using to get one to consider a membership. At the time, I was offered a six-month membership for 99 ($163). The full year membership is around 140. While I would have normally jumped on this membership, I thought of the V.A.T. tax (15%ish) and never really understood the explanation of the membership priveleges in the U.S. This kept me from buying a membership. The rates for members and friends/family are rediculous on weekends in some of the major cities. My room was beautifully decorated and immaculate. On each floor and in the lounges, one can get spring water and ice. In addition there is a closet on each floor so that one can remplinish any thing that is normally found in your room (coffee supplies, etc.) This is rare for any hotel.The wiresless internet was almost flawless and was a big draw to the hotel. There were also two lounges with computers that were free of charge. My only complaint(a small one) was the inability of the staff to keep some of the supplies replenished in the members' lounge. One of the nights, there was no more milk in the great coffee machine. After several attempts to remedy the situation, I gave up and found out that the milk was not added, even at 11 am the next morning. On my last night at the hotel, there were no more clean coffee cups for the coffee machine. I would think that keeping this area well stocked would be a priority for the hotel staff, in light of the fees that members and their corporate offices pay for access to the Club Quarters chain.I already mentioned that the area around the hotel was very lively.There is a restaurant attached to the hotel and a GARFUNKELS restaurant very close by. The food was good and relatively inexpensive for London. There is an all-night store on the corner which was a God-send. All-in-all, I had a wonderful stay. While I did not use the exercise room, I thought that it was really nice and very clean. Don't forget to ask for a pass to the members' lounge on the first floor. For coffee lovers, it is wonderful. I could not afford to get a starbucks coffee during my stay-just too many ."
32,1223,"Jun 13 2009 	Nice Hotel	The hotel was perfect for our stay. The room was very modern and clean. The staff was polite and informative. We took a taxi from Victoria Station to the hotel for 8 pounds. Trafalgar Square, and the Thames pedestrian bridge are less than a block away. We were able to walk every where (Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Leicester Square, Piccadilly circus, Temple Church. This came in handy due to the 'Tube' strike that occurred during our trip. We walked across the pedestrian bridge to the London Eye pier and rode a riverboat to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. We had breakfast the first two mornings in the hotel, but expensive compared to cafe's that are close by. We took car service to Victoria Station when we left, but due to the Tube strike it cost twice the amount. However, it was worth the convenience. We reserved the car early the day before we departed and that was the only way to get car service due to the high demand with no Tube. Remember, when you arrive at Gatwick airport just hop on the 'Gatwick Express' train to Victoria station and buy your train tickets on board with your credit card. Don't wait in a line. It is only a 30 minute ride. The Gatwick express cost us 58 pounds for two adults with return (round trip). The trains are expensive, but cheaper than car service for the distance."
33,1223,"Jun 11 2009 	Great value hotel in perfect location.	Close to the subway right in the heart of Trafalgar Square, a really great location. We had a twin room, perfect size and great shower! Thats all you need from a city-break hotel. There is a Garfunkels a few doors down which was great for a budget breakfast. Only a 10 minute walk from Covent Garden (in heels!) and the same from the London Eye. Only about 45 mins from Heathrow to the nearest tube which is just accross the street. Definately couldn't beat it for price, only 109/room in June."
34,1223,"Jun 9 2009 	Very Nice/Great Location	I stayed here for 5 nights last week. I got a great deal on Orbitz so it was worth changing from my normal spot. The hotel is easy to get to from LHR on the tube to Leicester Sq and walk or switch to Northern Line - either way works. I had a single room which was actually a double bed. The room was more spacious than I expected (based on normal London rooms). It was modern with nice furniture and a flat panel TV (which got about 20 channels). The bathroom was decent size with a shower only. Housekeeping seemed good. I never heard my neighbors (which is important especially when I sleep late occasionally).A friend visited the room and also commented on how nice it was.overall, if I got anotehr great deal - I would stay here again."
35,1223,"Jun 9 2009 	Don't bother...	Dark room looking out at dirty wall with stack pipe - had to keep light on all day!very uncomfortable sofa bed, whhich hurt my daughters back.Promised Queen sized bed was just a double push up in the corner of the room.Told some customers request this type of room -yeh right!Also told this was my fault because I did not tell them.Customer service absolutely appalling especially from Terna. - basically saying we had your money now clear off!.Not exactly worthy of the name &quot;The Grand&quot;Just as well it was only one night"
36,1223,"Jun 7 2009 	Nice Hotel outstanding location	Hotel was clean, Rooms bigger than expected for the location. The laundry facility was free. The location was super, a short walk to Trafalgar square and two tube locations. Could not ask for more for the price paid."
37,1223,"Jun 6 2009 	Will definitely stay here again and again...	My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in late April and early May 2009 as a result from good reviews from tripadvisor. Weather was excellent but unpredictable. It was mostly sunny w/ breeze and sprinkled for short time. But this is perfect weather for walking. We were pleasantly surprised how clean and new the hotel looked. We asked for a quiet room because we're both light sleepers. Our room card key used in the elevator brought us to our 6th floor room. We opened our door to a clean, spacious and modern room. The tv screen even displayed a welcome message with my husband's name on it. We used the tv screen with a provided remoteless keyboard (found in desk drawer) to access internet. Free internet was provided and we printed our boarding passes. After unpacking and freshening up we went to get free clean drinking bottles with free cold, filtered water to take on our short walk to Trafalgar square (1 minute from hotel and Charring Cross metro stop). It's also where National Gallery and National Portrait is located. There's a Tessaco (equivalent to USA's 7 Eleven) on the corner open 24/7. We bought breakfast/drinks here early in the mornings because the Brits don't start breakfast until 9am. We searched around and all breakfast places open at 9am. The only one close to the hotel was the hotel restaurant but we thought it was over priced. We ended up eating one morning at Porky's Pantry which is 3 blocks from the hotel. It is owner runned so the service and food was good as well as the price. I ordered a country breakfast with grilled tomatoes, toast, eggs, juice for $5 USD. Boots (equivalent to USA Walgreens) is located a few steps away. We bought nail clippers and men's in-sole gels for my husband's aching feet. The walk to Parliment and Westminister was 5 minutes, The Eye was 7 minutes, and Buckingham Palace 10 minutes. We ate burgers and spaghetti at Garfunkels which was next to the hotel. We also had fish and chips at a Pub around the corner. The food was good at all the places. We would always refill our water bottles when we got back to the hotel. The only time we took the metro, besides to the Heathrow, was to the British museum, Kengsington Palace, Picadilly Circus, Covenant Gardens, Tower London Bridge, and St Paul's Cathedral but these places were just a few stops away and we were there before we knew it. The metro is very easy to navigate. We never got lost and signs were posted everywhere. We bought a 3 day pass and 1 way ticket from heathrow to our hotel at the airport. We would DEFINITELY stay here again if we return to London. The location is safe and close to everything. British are friendly people but they smoke way too much. We got back to USA and relative said we smelled like smoke (both nonsmokers) at the airport. I washed both our jackets when we got home. We used tripadvisor to book our hotels for Paris, Venice, Rome, Athens, Cairo, and Luxor and Tripadvisor was right on the mark. We will always refer to it when we travel from now on."
38,1223,"Jun 4 2009 	No better location nor value in London	We stayed several nights at this hotel in late May 2009 and recommend it without hesitation. When we arrived at 1:00 AM they did not have our room (guests had failed to leave) but before my heart stopped beating , they apologised profusely and sincerely, arranged other accomodation at a nearby hotel ( they paid the difference), called a cab, put us into it and pressed cash in my hand for the return cab next morning AND &quot;for the inconvenience&quot;. When we returned at 9:00 AM next morning we were immediately shown to an upgraded room. Room was spacious with a view to Big Ben and other sights, included a mini fridge and microwave. The location cannot be beat , and is literally a 60 second walk to Traflagar Square and the geographic center of London. Pubs and restaurants abound, as well as all services a tourist could require. La Cage aux Folle is in the theatre 60 seconds away in the other direction, and transportation links abound in a similar radius. For the excellent price we paid I rather expected little service but was constantly amazed at how helpful all staff were...down to spending 15 minutes on their computer finding and helping us purchase the best deal on a train ticket to Oxford one day. Unbeatable!"
39,1223,"Jun 2 2009 	RACIST	My trips were usually with my friends at UniversityEvery time we visited , my friends (Europeans) were getting &quot;1 night free stay coupons&quot;,I was the only one who never got the the &quot;free stay coupons.&quot; in 5 visitsThe same incident happened with another Asian mate."
40,1223,"May 23 2009 	Amazing Hotel Experience	This hotel rocks!!! The location is perfect, close to everything.... Trafalgar Square is a 30 sec walk away and Enbankment with the London Eye is less than a 5 min walk. The rooms are a good size, the bed is very comfortable. The front desk staff very helpful. The free water dispenser with the plastic bottles on each floor a major plus... considering how expensive London is! Very clean hotel, the wifi and ipod connections a bonus. Also first hotel where the cleaning staff actually leaves the air conditioning on when you have it on. I would definitely stay here next time in London. Loved every aspect of it."
41,1223,"May 18 2009 	Great Location 	I staid there for 2 days April 24-26. The location is just great (about 100 meters from Trafalgar Square) and the price is very attractive, especially with the current exchange rate. The rooms are very clean and compared to other hotels I have seen in London, very, very clean with a comfortable bed. Ok, do not expect to have too much space but it is ok. I had a room to the backyard which was really quiet. Staff proved to be very helpful when I asked questions. Breakfast is provided next door at a very reasonable price. Therefore I can only recommend it and will also try other Club Quarter hotels."
42,1223,"May 17 2009 	Perfect location quality hotel	About only 50 yards from Trafalgar Square, this hotel is nigh on perfectly placed for visiting London. A steady 10 minute walk would put you in the heart of theatreland, a further 15 would see you all the way to the main shops on Oxford Street (if that floats your boat). The hotel lobby isn't the brightest I've ever seen, but the rooms are large (by London standards) clean, and the one we were allocated had the biggest bed I've ever seen. Ever. The bathroom was quite small, with no bath but with a large walk in shower, again very clean and modern. I'd definately use again."
43,1223,"May 14 2009 	Business hotel with bonuses and great location	The pictures and reviews are all accurate. The hotel decor is newly renovated and modern and the front desk personnel are very helpful and accommodating (we were able to check-in before 11am). The best thing about the hotel was the location, which is literally steps away from Trafalgar and is near both the Charing Cross and Embankment underground stops. We stayed from April 27-May 3, 2009 in a standard room (617) that overlooked Northumberland Ave. The room was quiet and had a comfortable queen bed as well as a microwave and refrigerator that came in handy for late night snacks and cold drinks. The bathroom was also renovated with just a large shower (we're not bath people anyway). London was cold (55-67F) but the room was always comfortable with the adjustable thermostat located at the bedside. The housekeeping staff was also very attentive, refilling toiletries and providing extra pillows and towels when requested. We also liked the free filtered water dispenser, which was located near the elevator and really saves a lot of money for those who insist on having bottle water to take while exploring the city. The free wi-fi worked great and we had access to the &quot;living room&quot; on the 2nd floor with one computer (those that are &quot;Club Members&quot; have their own lounge in the first floor), the fitness center in the basement was nice and the equipment worked great (some free weights, elliptical machines, bikes, treadmills, a weight-stack machine, as well as a water dispenser/bottles, and towels) but should be open 24hrs instead of closing at 9pm. We even used the free washer and dryer located on the 3rd floor (we brought dryer sheets from home and bought detergent from Boots store or you can buy it from the front desk),which saved us from packing a lot of clothes for our 2 week European trip. The Tesco (convenience store with fresh breads, as well as some prepared and microwave foods) was open 24hrs and located on the corner, while there was another small store near the Embankment station or the Mark Spencer near Charing Cross station. For those on vacation, the Hop-on/Hop-off bus tour stops are very close (one company stops right in front of the hotel). We walked everywhere, all the way to SOHO and Oxford Street and minutes away from Westminster Abbey, London Eye, Big Ben, etc. It is true the the hotel primarily caters to business travelers and there is no concierge, but a tourist center was within walking distance. There's no place to sit in the small lobby, but there is the 2nd floor &quot;living room&quot; with computer and large flat screen TV. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant (expensive Italian fare), but there are tons of restaurants nearby. The security elevators that require you to use your room key card to go to your floor takes multiple tries before it worked, which does get irritating. We would return again to this hotel."
44,1223,"May 6 2009 	very good stay without hasitation	stayed with my wife in the hotel for 9 days in April. The pros= excellent location, just off Trafalgar Square, which is a very central point with millions of buses passing by and within walking distance for other important places in London such as Picadilly Circus, Leicester Square, covent garden, the river, Parliament Square, London Eye etc and also 2 underground stations very very close.Very modern hotel, quiet and well equiped with free wi fi internet (and also a free printer in the second's floor lobby)Cosy room with convenient desk and television with lots of channels and also music and radio.free tea and coffee to make in the room, also refrigarator and microwave.free water refill and ice (very important, water is the most stupid money i spend when travelling abroad), also a storage with iron, coffee, tea etcbathroom ok.lots of cafes and restaurants around and a 24 hours TESCO at the corner (very useful).cons= a little bit hot, but air condition ok after 5 minutes.didn't like the cover of the bed, very heavy and uncomfotable.didn't clean very well. one day i found my pijamas on the floor and when we left we found the room a little bit dusty.overall, definately positive impression and value for money considering location and status of the hotel. next time in london would surely stay at this hotel again."
45,1223,"May 5 2009 	Excellent Location	This hotel is located just off Trafalgar Square. It is comfortable and quiet with a good nights sleep promised after a long day of sight seeing. The restaurants located around here are ok with a good choice of food available. If you would rather something more cheap and cheerful, head towards Leicester Square where a vast variety of cusine awaits you. The downside to this hotel is the bathroom, it is quite small but is clean and newly decorated. The staff are not overly-friendly either and are not prepared to help you with any questions that you may have for sight seeing/directions etc. There is a tourist office located nearby which is great and staff there are extremely helpful. The guest rooms are fully equped wtih internet access which is a great bonus for anything you wish to find and of course is free of charge! They are newly decorated and are very comfortable. I would definitly stay here again."
46,1223,May 4 2009 	Great location right in the heart of London	This hotel is literally a thirty second walk from Trafalgar Square. The rooms we had (3 in total) were beautifuly decorated and clean. One of the rooms had a fridge and microwave. The staff were extemely helpful and nothing was too much trouble.
47,1223,"May 4 2009 	PERFECT in every regard	This was my fourth trip to London and this was the perfect place to stay. Close to everything, pleasant and helpful staff, and really new and clean!! The room was just as pictured. I would not call the interior upscale but everything is very functional and spacious. I plan to stay here again when I return to London in the future."
48,1223,"Apr 28 2009 	Brill location.....	Perfect hotel for a weekend taking in a show, the usual London tourist things and wandering round the city. Great links via the tube, plenty pubs, restaurants and cafe's round about and just a stones throw from a walk along the Thames. The room was good for us with a view of Big Ben and the London Eye. Like other hotel rooms it is not completely sound proof but noise was not too bad. I think the check in/out service is perfect if you are in a hurry and reception always willing to help. Anything we wanted extra for the room was delivered pdq! Water and ice machine on each floor was a great touch and also the cupboards on each floor containing extra pillows, coffee, toiletries and soap was a real find. Would stay again without hesitation and even though it was slightly over the price we would pay for a weekend hotel it was worth every penny."
49,1223,"Apr 25 2009 	Perfect locations great rooms definately worth the money.	It took me two weeks of looking through reviews to find this hotel. It was a little more expensive but definately worth it. I was expecting a small room based on all the reviews. We had a huge room which included a fridge and microwave, bed was king size, great view and very clean. Free water bottles to use each day as well. Absolute best part is that is centrally located at Trafalgar Square. It is right next to the Embankment Station which could get you anywhere you needed to be. Next time we visit we'll stay here again. Walking distance to Buckingham palace, Big Ben, The london Eye, Leister square, the British museum. If you go I highly recommend seeing Wicked. Sherlock Holmes pub almost across the street with lots of restaurants/pubs within a 10/15 minute walk."
50,1223,"Apr 22 2009 	An overall great place to stay	Don't want to repeat all other reviews, but need to say the location is absolutely perfect. Plenty of good places to eat nearby. The Sherlock Holmes pub is a wonderful place for a drink or a meal. Everything one might want to see or do is close or easily reached by buses or tubes located very nearby. The hotel was great in every way. The water bottle service, the cleanliness and the efficiency of easy check-in and outs. The free internet access worked fine with no hassles at all. Two small things that could be irritating. The room was consistently hot but opening the window seemed to cool it a bit and the card key needed to move the elevator was sometimes tricky to work. Other than that, the place was perfect for my stay and I will try to book it again for each visit to London.Tip: St. Martin in the Fields Church has wonderful free concerts and a cafe in its Crypt that has excellent food at a good prices all day. Its right on Trafalgar Square and within a two blocks of this great hotel."
51,1223,Apr 21 2009 	Quiet and Clean!	Hotel is in great location - walking distance to everything. People at the front desk were helpful and very nice. The room was very homey - and very comfortable. I wish I had brought the bed back home...I enjoyed my stay and thought it was amazing. There's complimentary laundry and you can use the computer/internet in the lobby area.
52,1223,"Apr 19 2009 	The Grand... an unexpected delight with city vibe	The Grand exemplifies London... an old but elegant Victorian building housing a contemporary, modern hotel. The location is ideal; it is the center of London full of life with the city vibe. The room clean &amp; hot. The hotel's heating/cooling system is such that either the heat or air conditioning can be used but, not both simultaneously. We were there in April so heat on; A fan was provided. Filtered at water &amp; washer/ dryer was great. Breakfast at hotel was rip off at 12 pounds for continental."
53,1223,"Apr 15 2009 	Very Unique Hotel Concept	My partner and I found this hotel a refreshing change. When we booked club quarters we only chose it based on its price and good reviews. When we arrived we were surprised to find that there is minimal staff at the hotel. Instead, check in and out are via a cash point style terminal which despenses your room key. Very convienent-no waiting around at reception. The room was compact but excellent. We had great views out towards the Square, a little desk at the window, decent amount of storage space and a really well designed bathroom. It felt almost like a serviced apartment rather than a hotel which really suited us. There is a little room with a vending machine, chocoholics beware! And also a washing machine for guest use. On each floor there is a supply of water bottles and water and ice available-great to take out with you when sightseeing etc. The location is fantastic. This was our first time staying in Trafalgar, we normally stay near Kensington but this was such a convenient location and right next to the underground station. In all a great hotel, cant wait to return!"
54,1223,"Apr 6 2009 	Fantastic location charming boutique hotel	Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner. The location of this hotel helped made our trip awesome. We were right in the centre of London, walking distance to the theatre district, with many restaurants and bars right around us. I'd highly recommend staying in this hotel to anyone travelling to London for the same purpose as us - sightsee, theatre, fun. Free internet in the room was a bonus."
55,1223,"Apr 6 2009 	service was terrible would never stay there again!	having booked this hotel for 110.00 per n ight for 1 night it was not what i expected the staff were slow and totally un helpfull, service was really poor and i would not recomend anyont to stay there! upon arrival my room was not ready and none of the rooms have a bath ?! there was no tea bags or milk in the rooms and one lrg 1 sml towel between 2 people ? When i asked the hotel tobook a taxi for me when going out for dinner , they told me it would be 5-10 min ... i waited for 25 ! when i got into the taxi i went on a 4 min journey to the top of the street to be told it was 20.00 !!!!!! when i questioned this ridiculour price i was told it was the hotel commision thats why it was so expensive ?? On my return to the hotel i explained the taxi fair had been a totall rip off and asked about the commision, and in fact why i was not told by the hotel that it was a high fair and why they took comision from the guests? the man on reception quite abruptly told me it was my own fault and they dont have a responsibility to there guests to tell them , and that he was not willing to discus commision rates with me ... utterly disgusting customer servise !! There was alos no proper bar area just 1 restaurant which searved breakfast at 15.00 per head !"
56,1223,"Apr 2 2009 	Perfect Location 	We stayed at the hotel for a weeks holiday in March and luckily the sun shown the whole week. Our overall impression of the hotel was that it was spot on for what we needed. If you are not bothered by seeing lots of hotel staff and maids pestering to clean your room, this is the hotel for you. Everything is very self service, but saying that, the staff were very attentive when you need them to be. You can do self service check in and out. We arrived early and was able to get to our room. We opted for a suite with a mini kitchenette. It was very useful, but all you get in it is a microwave, fridge, a kettle, set of plates/bowls and cutlery. Saying that, you dont need it as everything is on your doorstep. We used it to make our own breakfast and store snacks/drinks. The room was a reasonable size. Large bed, enough storage for the 2 of us, a double sofa that was an extra bed. Large work space/desk and plasma tv. Sky Sports on the TV which was a bonus! The bathroom was small, no bath just a walk in shower but perfect for what you need. There were a couple of bad things by the end of the holiday did annoy us and that was the fact our view was rubbish! We were looking out into a small gap between the hotel, so looking onto another building of the hotel which made it feel quite clostrophobic. The room was also roasting. The air conditioning didn't do very much and it was very noisy. Saying that, I am sure if we complained we would have been moved. The room was very clean and cleaned every day. There is a nice touches with the distilled water and ice machines on every floor. This was really handy. They provide plastic bottles for you to fill with nice chilled water. There is also a guest cupboard that provides extra pillows, iron/iron board and things like tea bags, coffee, sugar etc. On the 3rd floor is a laundry room that is free to use with a washing machine and tumble dryer - I think you would need to provide your own washing powder. In the same room is a vending macine. There is free wireless in every room. We used this and never had a problem with it. The hotel offers room service from the restaurant attached but the menu is limit, we didn't use it, however they also have a take away option. Its a company called Deliverance which caters for all tastes, Thai, Chinese, Indian, European, Italian, Mexican etc. You can pick from all the menus and the company will deliver your order to the hotel. You can charge it to your room, but the hotel also add on a tray charge. We stayed in one night and had a delivery and the food was really nice - thats when the plates and cutlery came in handy from the kitchen. Any time we phoned guest services for anything, they were very nice and arrived at our room quickly (for extra toilet roll, a wine opener &amp; extra glasses). Outside the hotel, you are literally on Trafalgar Square. In the full week we were there, we didn't use the tube once and walked everywhere. There is a 24 hour tesco a minute walk away and also a Marks &amp; Spencer food hall. Covent Garden is about a 5 minute walk away. We ate in a really nice Thai Restaurant called Thai Square - its about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. We also went to the Albannach Doon nightclub 2 min walk - some very expensive cocktails but great.We had 1 drink in the Sherlock Holmes bar, a double Jack Daniels &amp; Coke and a double vodka with lemonade - 16!!! Down to the right of the hotel you are literally on the river and at Embankment Pier. We went to a concert at the 02 and you can get on the Thames Shuttle boat from Embankment straight to the 02 and return after the concert - it was perfect and a fiver each way and you get a drink on the boat. It takes about 30-40 minutes but a great way to see some sights to. We also used the hotel to pre-book taxis which are then set at a fixed price - which is good for London, especially when you are stuck in traffic. It cost us 79 for 4 people to Heathrow from the hotel for a larger car. All in all, I would say it was a perfect trip/hotel despite our small niggles with the view and heating. The total hotel cost was approx 1200 for 7 nights in the upgraded suite which for where the hotel is located and quality of the hotel I thought was very reasonable. If you want to know anything else, please just contact me as I could write so much more."
57,1223,"Mar 30 2009 	The perfect hotel in the best location	My husband and I stayed at the Grand at Trafalgar March 22-29, 2009. The hotel is beautiful on the outside and the inside. The exterior is historic and ornate (which we love about London buildings) and the rooms are modern and comfortable, with plenty of amenities. The best of both worlds!Check in was a breeze, and the staff were very helpful when we asked for directions to a nearby restaurant. Our room was very clean, and maid service came even when we got off to a late start. We really enjoyed the complimentary bottled water (helpful to have when you're walking 12 hours a day). The guest computer came in handy for checking in for our outbound flight and checking the weather. The hotel was very quiet, even though I think it was fully booked.As the other reviews have mentioned, the location can't be beat! The first 3 days of our trip we were able to walk everywhere we went: Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Churchill Museum/Cabinet War Rooms, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, National Gallery. There's a Tesco Express on the corner where you can get snacks (similar to a gas station store) and one of our favorite places to go was Garfunkel's Restaurant (next door to the hotel). They have excellent breakfast combos and the prices can't be beat! The two of us had hearty breakfasts (fried eggs, rashers of bacon, hash browns) each day before heading out. The total for both of us was about 11 pounds. Well worth it. Originally I considered staying at the Sofitel London St. James, since it's in the same vicinity, but now I know I made the right choice. The Grand at Trafalgar offers similar quality (except there's no doorman) at a fraction of the cost. We are definitely staying here the next time we visit London."
58,1223,"Mar 30 2009 	I cant wait to return!!	When I was planning my first trip to London the most important things to me were that the hotel was clean, comfortable, and in a good location, and this hotel more then delivered! The price was amazing for the location, you are merely a 1 minute walk from Charing Cross Station to get pretty much anywhere you would want in London. When you walk out of the front doors you can see Nelsons Column in Trafalgar Square, and all the activity down there, it really is a top notch location. Check in was easy and quick, and while I will say that the reviews about not really seeing a lot of staff or it being like a standard check in at a hotel is true, but it didn't impede the check in or out, and never had a need for anything else from them so it didn't bother me at all. We stayed on the 8th floor and I was impressed by the size of the room. I was imagining that it would me very small, but it was comfortable and very tidy. Would have been nice to have a tub or a bigger shower, but overall you will be pleased with the room accommodations that they offer. The only complaint I would have would be that no matter how low the cool setting on the air conditioner was the room seemed to stay very warm. Luckily it was spring like weather when we were there and simply leaving the window solved that problem.As a hotel manager I feel I have more expectations then most, and they have been more then met! I cannot wait to return to London and stay again at this property. Do not hesitate to have a great London experience and stay here."
59,1223,"Mar 24 2009 	Exceeded our expectations	My wife and I stayed at the Grand for a week, and it exceeded our expectations. I had been to London once before, and didn't think that it was possible to stay at a hotel as nice as the Grand for the price, and I was happy to be wrong!The Grand has obviously done some recent renovations, and they are all very tasteful, clean and contemporary. Our room had new linens, comforters, furniture, bathroom sinks, showers, etc. In addition, the room came with free WiFi and even a keyboard with an interactive flat-panel television for checking email, though it took some getting used to. I'm a big guy (6'2&quot; and 260lbs) so I appreciated the size of the bathroom and shower. The shower head is about 7' high and the water comes out strong, with a removeable shower head. Room service was efficient, replacing only towels left on the floor, and always replenishing other supplies. The hallway provided free bottled water and a tap with cold spring water as well as ice, and the second floor contains a large lounge area with comfortable tables and seating, as well as a hotel desktop that provides free internet for all guests. The newly decorated lobby included marble tiling, and is very pretty - though small - when you first step in. A doorman would be a nice, and appropriate, touch out front, but would probably drive the price up a notch. There is a small bar/restaurant attached to the hotel called Obika, which seems to specialize in Mozzarella treats and cocktails, but it was always empty and the waitstaff didn't seem eager to bring us in."
60,1223,Mar 18 2009 	Worth every penny !	This is a gem of a hotel located in the best area possible:10 min. from the Big Ben &amp; the parliament20 min. from Buckingham palace15 min. from Piccadilly Circus20 min. from the West end10 min. from the London's eye20 min. from the Tate modern20 min. from Covent GardenApart from this this is a high standard hotel with a large comfortablefoom size with Kitchen the staff were very attentive &amp; helpfullin all and all; the value for your money is great !I would probebly stay there the next time I'm in London
61,1223,"Mar 16 2009 	great hotel with only 2 negatives	just returned from a weekend at this hotel arrived at 11pm sat morning and was able to book in to our room right away however I will mention the negatives first, when entering the lift another couple already occupying the lift, was having trouble with their key card and we ended up having to get out of the lift at another floor and take the stairs to our floor. this also happened to us another 2 times even though we eventually managed to get the lift going after a few attempts. the only other negative was the heat in the room. no matter what we did with the aircon or how far we opened the windows we could not cool the room down but to be fair it was 17 degrees in london on the sunday after we arrived. Also friends that had travelled with us had booked a studio through venere and were given a double room but the receptionist deducted the money from their bill. now the pros well as mentioned before we got our room right away with no hassle with electronic check in. the room was modern and clean and average size for a couple just wanting somewhere to sleep and wash for a few nights. we had a microwave and a fridge in the room and cold water and ice machines on each floor ( maybe this was to compensate for the heat in the rooms ) staff were always helpfull and polite. no hassle again at check out and were able to leave our bags in a secure place for a few hours at no extra cost. also location was great for all sights and the west end. I would definately return if the heating could be sorted out as this hotel was great value for money ( 102 pounds including vat for 1 night )"
62,1223,"Mar 12 2009 	Very good value for money in a top location!	Stayed in the Club Quarters for a weekend end of Feb 09. Booked the hotel, due to the good reviews on TripAdvisor and the location just right at Trafalgar Square.The rate was very low at 84 per night excl. VAT. I arrived from London City Airport and took the DLR to Canning Town, then the Jubilee line to Waterloo and then the Bakerloo line to Charing Cross. Sounds a bit complicated but it was pretty easy and took around 30minutes. The hotel is just around two minutes away from the station and just near the hotel is a TESCO express where you can buy snacks and drinks etc.Check-in was swift at the check-in machine and I got room 733. The room was a bit small but after all it's London and as I was travelling alone it was fine. The decor was modern and everything seemed new and in good condition. There were many nice features in the room and I especially liked the fact, that I could plug in my iPod and listen to it, through the TV. The bed was comfortable and the shower had a good water pressure. Houesekeeping did a good job during my stay and I didn't encounter any problems with the staff. Oh and another good thing, they have free WIFI.Of course it goes without saying that the location is just GREAT. About 5min away from Piccadilly Circus and China Town and from Charing Cross you can get to almost everywhere in London very easily.I'm returning to London this year at least once and will definitely chose Club Quarters."
63,1223,"Mar 9 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location	The Grand is a nice, clean hotel with great amenities, but more importantly- it's location in central London is fantastic. It is right smack in the center of things. It is also a half a block from the river- if you are a runner, the path along the river is fantastic. The hotel had complimentary water bottles along with a machine on each floor so that you may fill up your bottle as often as you like. The gym was well-appointed as well. The location of this hotel really gave us a good feel of the city. We had stayed at a hotel in Kensington at the start of our trip... and it was too residential of an area. Trafalgar is a busier area, but everything is within walking distance. I really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would definitely stay there again."
64,1223,"Mar 8 2009 	Great Location	Great location. Big &amp; clean room - great service by staff. only minus is that there was a bit cold in the room, had problems getting the heat up and there was not a minibar in the room."
65,1223,"Mar 5 2009 	3rd time around its still a charm	Can't get enough of this hotel. This is our third stay at Club Quarters Trafalgar Square in 8 months - all for leisure. If you love being in the centre of it all, this is the place to stay. The hotel is across the street from Trafalgar Square, National Portrait Gallery, Canada House, and the National Gallery. Its 5 minutes from Convent Gardens, Leceister Square, theatre district and 8 minutes from SOHO, Chinatown &amp; Piccadilly. If you walk in the opposite direction towards Embankment, you're 5 minutes away from the London Eye, Dali Universe, the National Defence and Westminister Abbey!Embankment &amp; Charing Cross Tube stations are both within 3 minutes.Tesco Express is at the corner along with many other cafes and restaurants!Love it!"
66,1223,"Feb 27 2009	Very disappointing end to our stay	We enjoyed the hotel itself - the location was great, the rooms were a decent size and very clean. Considering its location, the hotel is great value for money. However, we experienced a few problems. Firstly, it seems the wireless internet is not available in all rooms. Those furthest away from the elevator seem to be too far away, meaning I had to stand in the hallways near the lift to send/receive emails. But this alone wasn't a major inconvenience. Our main problem was on the morning of departure. The staff member recommended we get a taxi to Leicester Square (on the Piccadilly line so no line changes required to Heathrow) due to our heavy suitcases and the likelihood of rain. He booked the taxi for us. Not only was the taxi not an official one - it was just a regular car, no taxi markings. It could have been simply a friend for all we know. The driver took us through Piccadilly, then to the back of Leicester Square meaning we still had to walk to the tube stop anyway! Already fuming, we were charged 13 pounds ($A30) for a 3 minute trip at 6am! Almost as much as the shuttle direct to the airport. We paid the fare as we just wanted to get out of there. I emailed the hotel shortly after to complain and was told my complaint was forwarded to the manager who would reply shortly. I have never received a response. Despite the hotel itself being nice, I would never, ever stay here again - simply as a matter of principle. Not to mention the hotel doesn't even have the courtesy to respond or provide an explanation. Very poor form."
67,1223,Feb 21 2009 	Good place to stay!	Stayed for one night to watch Mamma Mia great location two tube stops away from the show. Trafalgar Square just a minutes walk away. Really good price only negative was the room was really hot could not get it too cool down adjusted the air conditioning to the lowest setting.
68,1223,Feb 19 2009 	Terrific clean hotel!	My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights and it was terrific. The location was great and the rooms were small but very clean and modern. We unfortunately did not have much of a view outside our window but it was still a nice place. I would stay there again.
69,1223,"Feb 14 2009 	Couldn't fault it	The hotel is in Northumberland Avenue of 'Monopoly' fame, close to bothTrafalgar Square and the footbridge over to the South Bank; yet our room (at the back on the fourth floor) was perfectly quiet. The bed was comfortable, the room clean, the TV screen could be used as a computer monitor; there were an umbrella and books on London available; around the corner extra tea, milk, coffee, pillows and water could be had, along with an iron and proper ironing board. Really, we wanted for nothing! There's also an automated booking-out system which minimises the usual five-to-twelve queue. We paid 96 per night booked via Londontown.com, and were there for the theatre - only a few minutes walk away. Couldn't fault it!"
70,1223,"Feb 12 2009	Great location	We stayed at the Grand a very cold weekend in January. We got a good last minute deal after using a lot of time finding a decent, not to expensive hotel, in this neigbourhood.And the location is so great. You can walk anywhere......And we like that. If you need to take the tube, the station is a few minutes away.The hotel was nice. We had a large, nice decorated room with a nice bathroom, coffe and tee etc. Will absolutely stay here again next time in London."
71,1223,"Feb 9 2009	Great Hotel Great Location	Trying to find a decent hotel in London without paying really silly money is always a bit tricky, however The Grand is a real find. Located within seconds of Trafalgar Square, a few minutes walk from The Embankment and Whitehall, a twenty minute stroll from Covent Garden and five minutes from Charing Cross station, you couldn't wish for a better location.The hotel is clean, friendly and welcoming. It has some great features like the &quot;Guests' Locker&quot; on each floor from which you can help yourself to extra pillows, blankets, tea, coffee etc. In addition there is a fresh water and ice dispenser, complete with bottles on each floor, which saves paying out for bottled water at London prices.The rooms are clean and well kept, comfy beds and no problem with outside noise. We had a good size tv, a cd radio alarm clock and internet access in the room. There were also a few books provided by the hotel in the bedside cabinet, which was a nice touch, as was the umbrella which was in the wardrobe.The bathroom was very clean and modern, with a good size walk in shower; the towels were a bit small, but that was not a real problem (every Persian carpet has a flaw).There is no restaurant in the hotel as yet, however a delivery service is available from local restaurants. We did not book breakfast as there are a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby where breakfasts are served.The Grand is great hotel, I usually hate staying in London as I don't like having to use the tube to get anywhere and central London prices are usually beyond my budget, however at 113 per night per room, The Grand was a really good deal. Book with confidence, you won't be disappointed, this as a super hotel, in a fantastic location. For a short stay you won't find better for the price."
72,1223,"Feb 8 2009 	Hotel Nightmare	My first impression of the hotel when I checked in was &quot;a little too spare, yet adequate.&quot; But wait until you hear what happened! I checked in after a long flight, changed quickly, and left for dinner. We returned about five hours later to find the door unlocked with an &quot;occupied&quot; sign in the key slot/lock, the pillows piled up to the bedside (clearly moved) and used chewing gum in a tissue by the bed. I didn't do any of this. Major YUCK factor, not to mention scary. I was glad my computer and, apparently, nothing else was stolen. I didn't get mad, but I was creeped out, concerned about the sheets and had to ask to change rooms. I was moved to a new room (but a step down - smaller and without a microwave and frig). They apologized for the problem with the &quot;unlocked door&quot; but avoided the other blatant and disturbing facts. Talk about denial! I'm mad for two reasons. One, my space was invaded. Two, the staff is treating me like an &quot;uncomfortable issue&quot; they wish didn't exist. It's bad enough to be victimized, then add to that a staff that has no clue how to deal!My advice: never stay here! I've traveled a lot and nothing like this has ever happened to me - has anything like this happened to others at a hotel?"
73,1223,"Feb 6 2009 	It doesn't get any better than this!!	I just returned from a 3 night stay in London. I was a single woman traveling. I read the reviews on Travel Advisor before making my decision to book this hotel. The location was absolutely perfect!! Price was great at the time of booking.....averaging 135.00 USD. It is the bus stop for not only the &quot;Original Bus Tour&quot; (which was a wonderful experience in itself), but the city buses, and the &quot;Ghost Bus Tour&quot; at this front door. Very safe, clean, free internet (I did not have a lap top), very clean room. I thought the room was large compared to many in NYC. The in room coffee was delicious! This Hotel is right in the center of everything. Take the walking tours ( included in price of the &quot;Original Bus Tour ticket). Those tours leave up the street about a less than 5 minute walk. The front desk helped me out in a crisis. I lost my international cell phone and had no communication with my family. She immediately picked up the front desk phone and called my home in the states!! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. As a single traveler it was perfect. &quot;Sherlock Holmes Pub&quot; is across the street...great pub!"
74,1223,"Feb 4 2009 	Great hotel for business travel! Incredible location	I stayed here on business travel for eight nights (Jan 23rd -31st). Club Quarters is a hotel designed for business travel (low frills, no concierge with clean and small rooms). If you are a tourist looking for a large sitting room and a concierge, do not stay at Club Quarters! But if you are looking for a very clean, well-run hotel that is incredibly located, Club Quarters is for you.This CQ location actually has much larger rooms than any of the other 4 branches I've stayed in (2 in NY, Chicago and Washington DC). Bed was quite comfortable, bathroom was quite modern, and hotel was quite impeccably clean. Business lounge and laundry both met my needs quite well. (The wifi in the rooms left a bit to be desired)."
75,1223,"Jan 30 2009 	Clean/Quiet/Greatr Location	Booked through Expedia at around 125 a night inc VAT. for the weekend of Jan 23rd-25th with my girlfriend. Location was fantastic, &lt;2 mins walk from several 'attractions' such as Trafalgar Sq, The London Eye, The West End, Somerset House, Buckingham Palace (5-10mins). Also a Tesco Express round the corner for some essentials if needed.Room #415, on the small side but not too small. Clean and Noise from the busy street below nonexistent (view looking out onto the street/trafalgar sq). Free High speed internet in the rooms, wireless or wired worked perfectly and decent TV reception though volume a bit nasty (No SkySports News).Seen some complaints about the lifts not working but didnt have a problem once we worked out what it was you have to do! Didnt have breakfast here but several places nearby which have nice breakfasts (Cafe Fiori round the corner was nice).Recommended"
76,1223,"Jan 26 2009	Excellent location small room	The location is greatWhen you go in the lobby just be aware there are two receptions, (the grand &amp; club quarters)We'd booked a standard room, the decor was nice but the room was very small, definitley smaller than other hotels I've stayed in London. This was a bit disappointing especially because of the price we'd paid. There was no bath, just a shower. No fridge and our room had an internal view. On the plus side the rooms are very soundproof , there was a protest outside and we didn't even hear it.Overall a good hotel, for the right price. If you can upgrade room size"
77,1223,"Jan 25 2009	Excellent hotel	Really liked our stay at this hotel. Spacious and very comfortable. The bathroom was very clean, lots of room. We didn't hear much noise from the street below at all, a bonus considering the location is so close to Trafalgar Sq. Very convenient for all the sightseeing we wanted to do. The staff were most polite and helpful too. I'd stay there again."
78,1223,Jan 16 2009 	Good value and location	Pros:- Very convenient location close to public transportation- Large business center and common room (with complimentary beverages)- Modern and clean- Good valueCons:- Very small rooms and narrow hallways
79,1223,"Jan 12 2009 	Low Cost Business Model Does Not Work For Hotels!	We stayed in the Club Quarters for 2 nights in January 2009. Firstly the location is fantastic. A running jump from Trafalgar Square and comfortable walking distance from all the main tourist attractions of London.Our main observation on the hotel is that it is run as a low cost business with staffing kept to a minimum. This was apparent at check in where we were instructed to check in via a touch screen terminal on the wall. All well and good but the terminal didn't work so we had to get our keycards at the reception (which is badly located on the hallway to the elevators). The room was fine - nothing special but fairly large and comfortable. The bed wasn't great though, with the covers consisting of a thin flat sheet and a large blanket which kept falling off the bed. The hotel offers guest &quot;lockers&quot; (presumably instead of maintaining extra staff) where you can go yourself to pick up extra supplies for the room. We wanted to get an extra pillow and some extra towels but found that most of the guest lockers were locked, and could only find a pillow with a brown stain on it and no towels.When we returned to our room at around 5pm on the second day of our stay, our room had not been made up. We rang reception and were assured it would be done. We left and returned again around 11pm and it was still not done and we had no fresh towels for the following morning.I would not recommend this hotel given the wide range of choices available in London. It promotes itself as a 4 star hotel but it offers no dining facilities (as of January 2009) and feels like corners are being cut to minimise costs, but at the expense of the comfort of its customers."
80,1223,"Jan 11 2009 	Great hotel and location	When booking hotels as part of packages you always run the risk of not getting very good accomodations. The opposite was true for us. The Grand (Club Quarters) at Trafalgar square in London was an excellent hotel. We went in January which is considered the low period of tourism in London. The hotel seemed pretty vacant, which made it very quiet. We had a nice view of the street below, and contrary to other reviews, the traffic noise was not disturbing. The walls of the hotel seemed to be thick enough.The room was adequate in size. The room was heated well. Very nice considering there were record low temperatures in London while we were there. The bathroom was also nice in size. The maid came everyday and cleaned our room very well.One of the nice features of this hotel is that empty water bottles and a purified water dispensers are on each floor of the hotel. This complimentary service was nice to have. They also have a free washer and dryer for guests. The only thing that was lacking was a refrigerator in the room, that would have been nice.The location was great. Trafalgar square is located in the heart of London and the Tube, underground subway is right accross the street from the hotel. There are many places to eat nearby. There was also a Tesco Express that was open 24 hours, a great place to grab a sandwich and chips on evenings when restaurants are closed. The staff were friendly and helpful. They booked a tour for us to Stonehenge while we were there.Overall, I would definitely stay there again."
81,1223,"Jan 4 2009 	Absolute Gem!	Hotel is on a quite street between Trafalgar Square and Hungerford Bridge, to the South Bank; a perfect location for all the sights and convenience and yet still quiet. The hotel is not serviced with numeorous staff that open doors fro you and such, but attention to detail is still there. I will gladly forego opening opening the door for me or helping me with my luggage for the exceptional location, rooms and quality of the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are well appointed; good TV plasmas; excellent for computer in room; tea/coffee making facilities; wonderful comfy bed; business desk chair; clock radio alarm even a small bookshelf with a few good reading books. Moderm decor but comfortable. The small faults are the small bath towels and no safe in the room. Hotel has a water purifying system that allows guests on each floor access to chilled water, even providing bottles. This is a WONDERFUL asset; as is the common floor closets with ironing board, extra tea and condiments. There is also a good guest lounge on the second floor with TV and computer access. The gym downstairs is a little small but good machines and in good condition. Just 4 doors down is a Tesco Express for your food needs; and well you are 1/2 a block from Tralfagar and the Center of London - so everything you need is very close: Chargon Cross Station, any transportation; restaurants, banks, phamracy, bookstore, take-out food places, souvenier shops...whatever you need is at most a 5-10 minute walk. The Sherlock Holmes Pub is across the street and down the alley by Sherlock Holmes in Craven Passage, leading to The Strand, is a good little pub. A WONDERFUL STAY, LUCK IF YOU CAN BE THERE!"
82,1223,"Jan 2 2009 	Great Hotel	We visited London for New Years 08/09 and Club Quarters was brilliant. Check in and check out was quick and easy and staff were really friendly.The location of the hotel is perfect. Embankment and Charing Cross stations are literally across the road. Trafalgar square, the London eye and so much more are only minutes away.Our room was perfect - clean and definitley big enough. Bathrooms have been described as small in other reviews but they're fine! The water stations are really handy! Only thing was the vending machine, which is nicely hidden on the third floor, didnt work! But this really wasnt a big deal. We didnt use the hotel bar or get any room service. Too many great places around to try.Great hotel - would recommend it to anyone!"
83,1223,"Jan 2 2009 	Perfect location great hotel	I stayed here Mid December for just the one night. Fantastic location, near Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross tube station, The Strand, Covent Garden, Theatreland etc etc and The most comfortable pillow I have ever slept on in my entire life!! I wanted to take it home with me!Room facilities are good. Sony radio alarm clock with a CD by the good sized bed with nice bedlinen, flat screen tv with free internet access, tea and coffee facilities, with distilled water just outside on the corridor. I was in room 305 overlooking the main road, but was never once disturbed by traffic. Staff were friendly and courteous. They were happy to mind my bag all day after I checked out.Cost wise, I found it good value. You won't get a better location for the price, that's for sure. While the rooms feel five star, there are a few quibbles regarding the facilities, but there are so many restaurants and cafes for all price ranges that it's a minor thing. Staying here was a hassle free, comfortable pleasure from start to finish. If I ever need to stay in Central London again, this will be the place."
84,1223,"Jan 1 2009 	Great location great comfort	On a great weekend rate through Hotwire (about 150 USD) this was incredible value for money. Unbeatable location only steps from Trafalgar Square and literally a few minutes walk from Westminster and the Thames.The room was very nice and clean, as were the beds.Great system with free purified water in machines on every floor, although weekend staff seemed to be at a minimum as water bottles were not available until we asked (but then two chilled bottles were delivered at our room). Hallways were unexplicably hot, but didn't matter much as room was fine.No restaurant at the time of our visit (June 2008), but room service was available by way of a takeout company which turned out to have wonderful food (and beer). Breakfast can be had at several cafes and bars on the same street, better than most hotel breakfasts anyway.This hotel is highly recommended for tourists who can get a special rate."
85,1223,"Dec 29 2008 	loved this hotel!	i loved this hotel i stayed for a couple of nights to go watch a west end show!it was a quick and easy check in and found the staff incredibly helpful! the only problem i had was the key it was a bit of a nightmare to get in late at night and using the elavator but that is my only fault with this hotel! the location is brilliant to do everything you want and the rooms are spacious, smart and clean. i would recommend thid hotel, defiantly value for money,."
86,1223,"Dec 29 2008 	Superb location nice hotel at a good price	This hotel has an absolutely fabulous location for those visiting London. It is one minutes walk from Trafalgar Square and also within walking distance of Picadilly, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Holborn and also sites across the Thames such as the Tate and the London Eye. The nearest tube station is Embankment. I got a great price for this hotel - 109 per night for a double room. The hotel itself was lovely. It is not a luxury hotel but everything was more than satisfactory. The staff were very pleasant, the building itself is impressive, with a very grand marble lobby. The rooms are modern and well-designed. I had absolutely no problems with anything here and would definitely recommend it and indeed stay again if I was in London."
87,1223,"Dec 22 2008 	Great location for first time visit	This hotel is perfectly located for a first-time visitor to London, which I was. A Tube stop is half a block away. Within walking distance are: Parliament, Westminster Abbey, The London Eye, Soho, Covent Garden, and many restaurants and coffee shops.I had a larger room with kitchenette (never used it!) and sofa. Although it faced a busy street, it was very quiet with the windows closed.I researched London hotels extensively, and this was very reasonably priced (US $170 per night) in a very expensive city. I'd stay here again without hesitation."
88,1223,"Dec 9 2008 	Jolly good hotel	Just spent a Saturday here. Excellent location, the staff was very helpful, room very clean and comfortable. Would stay here again and would recomment highly to my mom."
89,1223,"Nov 23 2008 	Fantastic Location	The location of the hotel is great , located right on Trafalgar sq and a 5 minute walk to great shops, bars and resturaunts in Leicester sq, Picadilly circus and the strand.We were able to walk to all the Theatres and all major shopping streets, covent Garden, Regent st , Oxford st.The Hotel has a quick check in/0ut system which is done by automated self service machines.Have visited London on many occasions on shopping/theatre breaks and this hotel was definately the best for this.Would absolutely use this hotel every time for any future visits."
90,1223,"Nov 23 2008 	Perfect Location!	We stayed here in early November 2008. The hotel was in a great location a half block from Trafalgar Square and the Charing Cross Underground station. The Embankment Underground station was also a short walk away. We were able to comfortably walk from the hotel to Westminster Abbey. There are lots of restaurants and pubs (try the Sherlock Holmes pub across the street) within easy walking distance. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was large for a European hotel. The air conditioner never really cooled the room. The elevators also require use of your room key to operate, and the card reader was sometimes tempermental (and directions are not very clear). Free distilled water and distilled ice on every floor along with bottles were a nice perk. The guest convenience closet on each floor was also a nice touch for obtaining additional pillows, ironing board, extra tea/coffee, etc. We would definitely stay here again."
91,1223,"Nov 22 2008 	FREAKIN' AWESOME!!!!	I'm in the hotel biz myself, so I am REALLY picky...tend to notice every flaw. No need to attach photos here....the ones already posted are accurate representations.GREAT location, GREAT staff, GREAT room!! Rooms are more 'American' style than European....nice size, nice size bath. Very comfortable, quiet, very nice. Will be my first choice everytime I visit and I hope to often.The absolute only less-than-stellar thing was that the wireless internet connection was unstable, and internet (wired too) went out completely one nite. It was their ISP, not hotel's fault.Absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel."
92,1223,"Nov 16 2008 	Club Quarters - decent mid priced hotel at heart of London	This was my second stay at the Club Quarters at Trafalgar Square. We chose it for the location.The hotel is smart and clean. Staff were efficient and pleasant. Our room was a &quot;Club Size&quot; double room, compact but not too small for two adults. There was a desk, phone, LCD TV, free and easy to use Wi-Fi, air conditioning and plenty of space for clothes etc. The bed was *very* comfortable, the room was quiet at night.The bathroom was fine, shower but no bath. I was annoyed by the size of the towels which were a little over 3 ft long. I hope that does not become a trend in London hotels!"
93,1223,"Nov 8 2008 	great location and price	What you need to know about the reviewer:Couple in 30s traveling w/o kids; From US; 1st time to London; we travel 2-3 times per yearThe hotel is well located in the heart of London. Easy access to the theaters and major attractions (TIP: take a bus tour when you arrive to see all the sights and then get off when you want to get up close to something, you can hop back on for free)Room: modern, clean, well maintained Service: very good - provided extra pillow in 10 minutesFood: NA - only one restaurant in building (no one in there when we walked by), but there is plenty in the area (TIP: Check our Sherlock Holmes Pub across the street)Nice surprise: free water on each floorWorst surprise: the elevator requires a room card and it often takes 3-4 tries to get it to workStrange: The fact that it is a hotel within a hotel is unusual, but will not affect your stayNet: Would definitely stay here again. The location and price ($150 USD per night via Orbitz) make it a fantastic value"
94,1223,"Nov 7 2008 	Wonderful Location	I stayed here for two nights with my mum. The location was excellent. Right in Trafalgar square and just short walking distances to all main areas. Very quick booking in system on arrival, room cards also operate lifts, which can be tempremental but ok, our room was a nice size, with fridge and microwave, no real view but rooftops but didnt except much else so was fine. Unlike the other reviews our room was Boiling hot! We tried everything to alter it but nothing worked, no air con, ended up having window wide open to try and sleep but in central Londin its very noisey! Our toilet blocked but they were quick enough to send someone up to rectify. The water and the cupboards around the corridors with supplies of tea bags, sugar, shower caps etc is a nice touch as they only leave two tea bags in the room. There is a Garfunkles next door and a Prezzo (Italian restuarant) opposite so you have somewhere to eat right on the doorstep as well as the hotel restuarant, although when we were there i saw no one in it. The staff were helpful, you are able to leave your luggage secure when you check out. All in all a very nice hotel, im glad we got a good deal with the price though as i dont think its that much better than the Premier Lodge near Picadilly, although no complaints either. As for location - superb!"
95,1223,"Nov 3 2008 	great location	My husband and I stayed here for one night with a couple of friends. The location was great right in the heart of everything. We had a room on the 9th floor with views to the London Eye, Big Ben, Buck House and Whitehall. The room was very nice but cold, the heating controls didn't seem to work properly. There was a flat screen telly, internet point for your laptop, a microwave and a fridge. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate with a good shower. Our friends had a room on the 4th floor with a very large bed but no microwave or fridge and no view. We stayed in the part called club quarters, from what we could make out the grand part isn't ready yet. We ate breakfast at Garfunkels next door as we weren't prepared topay ~26 for it at the hotel. The only downside to this hotel is that it doesn't have a bar. As most of the bars nearby close at 11.30, this was quite frustrating as we would have liked a coupleof drinks after leaving the theatre. All in all a very nice hotel in a great location which we would use again."
96,1223,"Nov 1 2008 	Very Convenient Location!	This hotel is in a great location, right in Trafalgar Square. It's an easy walk to the tube, tour bus pick-up locations, shopping/restaurants along Strand, Leicester Square, etc. My room was average-sized for a European room, though my friend had a nicer, larger room on a higher floor. The front desk was very attentive and provided helpful information for getting around London. The hotel was fine, the best part being its location."
97,1223,"Oct 30 2008 	Classy Beautiful Comfortable	What a great stay at this hotel. We feel like we got a pretty good deal from a website for a hotel in london at this location. I would stay here again in a second. we were about a 15min walk in any direction to great stuff. you're about 250yards from trafalgar square, covent garden, soho, picadilly are all nearby and the tube is a 2min walk around the corner. we loved the water purifier fountain in the hallway with brand new bottles provided. for as much water as we drank, walking the city for hours and hours, we saved a ton of money just on water. we did have a small problem with our heating system. they sent a repairman very quickly and soon figured out the problem. it wasn't something they could fix right away so within a few minutes they had a floor heater for us that worked perfectly as a replacement. hi speed internet in the rooms. nicely, modern, and updated, clean and comfortable rooms, nothing else to stay but what a great hotel and nice stay."
98,1223,"Oct 30 2008 	Nice Hotel Good Location Poor service	We stayed here for a weekend away and first thing I have to say is the Tube Service is EXCELLENT. The Hotel is in a fantastic location, close to all you will need to see and all the night life. Room was nice, even though it was not the type of room I booked, which brings me to the bad points encountered. Firstly the room type, I ordered and payed for a Superior Suite and was given a Standard Double. As it was late on Friday night when we arrived I just wanted to get to bed. The next day I went to talk to the manager who does not work weekends and the Duty Manager was not in until Mid-day. We went for breakfast in their temperory resturant, actual resturant was being remodeled, and the breakfast was below standards expected with this type/class of hotel. We went on our way for our day out after the breakfast from hell. On our return later that evening I was talking to the Check in clerk who told me that the room I was given was the one that was booked for me by Expedia. I then contacted Expedia and they told me what I already knew and with that I contacted the Clerk and explained what Expedia had confirmed with me. He then became very sorry and offered to upgrade us the next time we stayed."
99,1223,"Oct 26 2008	Good hotel in a very central location	I stayed here with my husband from October 8-10. We were only in London for a few days to sight-see, and we got a relatively decent rate for this hotel (considering its location) on hotels.com. We had no problems checking in (even though we showed up a few hours before check-in time). We had a &quot;standard room&quot; (no kitchenette) with a queen size bed. The room was amply (but not generously) sized and it was clean and quiet. The bed was pretty comfortable. Water pressure in the shower was fine. Included wifi and purified water were definite pluses.Our only complaint was the heat not going as warm as we set it - we could hear a lot of air blowing around in the vents behind the headboard of the bed, but our thermometer showed it was several degrees colder than the thermostat thought it was."
100,1223,"Oct 26 2008 	Same as the Club Quarters Hotel	Because this hotel is listed twice under two different names, I'm posting my review here, too, so people wondering can know it's the same place as the Club Quarters hotel:For the price and the location this can't be beat. It costs a fraction of what other hotels in the same area are going for. It's one of the only affordable options in London, really.This hotel is also known as The Grand hotel. The Club Quarters and Grand hotel are the same place: the same building, they have the same rooms, same elevators, same housekeeping, and same reception desk. See, the Club Quarters is a membership-only hotel, while the Grand isn't. Not just anybody can stay at a Club Quarters hotel. But apparently there are a couple hotels that non-members can stay in. There are great perks such as filtered water stations on each floor. We were able to refill our water bottles daily before heading out on the town.The bad side: the Mozzarella bar is disgusting. The service isn't very good and the cheese is pretty bad. The people working there are kind of arrogant and believe they have the best of the best and if you haven't had their cheese, you haven't had the real stuff... Well, I've been to Italy and know what buffalo mozzarella should taste like. I've also had equally amazing servings in New York and Los Angeles. But this place is not so good. If they are truly flying this in daily from Italy I think they're being ripped off. Because it simply isn't very good cheese.We did not try the breakfast because it seemed overpriced for what was available. Plus, it's served in the Mozzarella bar.Instead, my advice is to walk a few doors down the street to Garfunkles for a BAP, or eggs, bacon, toast, orange juice, etc.For dinner, try the Sherlock Holmes pub across the street - they had a pretty good fish and chips (that didn't taste fishy) and the atmosphere was fun.I'd definately stay here again."

102,1223,"Oct 20 2008 	Fresh new room interior	Myself and my husband stayed here for our 1st Wedding Anniversary. We wanted to do some shopping and sightseeing in London and this hotel was perfect! Club Quarters is beside Charing Cross and Embankment Stations, 5 mins walk from the Thames and London Eye. There is a tourist office 5 mins away who have discounted tickets for sights and shows. Picadilly and Leicester Square are 10 min walk away. The hotel itself was clean, quiet and the interior design was very nice. The hotel room was very up-to-date, new carpet, modern dark furniture, flat screen, comfortable bed. The bathroom had nice marble and a great mirror! We did not eat in the hotel as there are so many restaurants around. The only thing that happened was our room was not cleaned, linen changed the first day. We had left the room at 8:30am and returned at 15:00 the first day, as we left again I mentioned it to reception. When we returned at 19:30 it still had not been done! I rang and housekeeping said we had put a 'do not disturb' sign on the door!! Of course we didnt as we werent even there, so they arrived up in half hour and made the bed etc..Other than that the place is great and we will be staying in Club Quarters there and in other locations in the future."

104,1223,Oct 14 2008 	Nice room and good location.	Great location right next to tube stations. Very clean comfortable room. Friendly staff. Plenty of resturants nearby. Would stay here again.
105,1223,"Oct 13 2008 	Make me a member!	This hotel is in a wonderful location for sightseeing. It is just steps from Trafalgar Square and within walking distance of Big Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. We also walked to Leicester Square and Soho, although, we like to walk. Our room was very nicely decorated. While it was a little on the small side, it certainly was adequate and didn't feel cramped. We booked through Orbitz and got a great rate. The free water machine in the hallway is a very nice plus! There is a chi-chi Italian restaurant in the hotel, but we didn't eat there. There is a Garfunkel's a minute away and they have good breakfast. Tesco Express on the corner also has pastries and donuts if you are into grab and go. The Charing Cross tube station is closest. There is a PC with a printer on the 2nd floor that you can use, which is very handy for printing boarding passes. Inserting your key card in the elevator to make it work can be a little tricky, but I had more luck than my husband! Really, it's not a big deal and in my opinion is worth it from a security standpoint. I would absolutely stay here again without hesitation!"
106,1223,"Oct 13 2008 	Will stay here again	We chose this hotel after reading the reviews at tripadvisor.com and our expectations were met! Excellent location, just steps away from the underground.The staff was very friendly and efficient, and the common areas and the room itself were clean. We did not try the breakfast (at a whopping 12!), as there are plenty of options for much less in the vicinity.A few niceties: coffee/tea in the room, umbrella (!) and a real blowdryer, and bottled water in the corridor. Computer with internet access and a printer is available in the lounge, free of charge. Brilliant when you want to do an online flight check-in and print your boarding pass :)We would definitely stay here again!"

We did not get the studio room which we had a conformation for and my daughter had no bedding for her sofa bed.the rooms are very new and clean, not a bad size for london, however I had to ask at reception four times before we got our bedding, the chap on reception the final time I asked did meet our request and sent a basket of goodies up to us as an apology.The lifts are a little suspect and work under their own rules, the same has to be said for our flat screen TV, the hotel is not the best Ive stopped in by far but the cleaniness and the location would pull me back without a doubt."
108,1223,"Oct 4 2008 	Good All Round Hotel	Having been to London a few times, this hotel was our favourite so far. It has an excellent location and the rooms have pretty much everything you need for a short break. Although it doesn't have a restaurant at the moment, it is very central, so there are plenty of choices for eating out. We had no complaints about the service or accommodation whatsoever, and would definitely book it again."

Trafalgar Square is just few steps away with many choices of restaurants. The hotel is sitting between two underground stations. Big Ben and Westminister Abbey are within walking distances.The room itself is fairly adequate. The hotel does have washer/dryer/microwave facility. Best of all, there are clean filtered water and water bottles for you to take away on your day trip. Wireless internet is free. There's also a desktop PC with printer free to use in the lounge.As many people noted, we also experienced some difficulties with the elevator using our room key. But it's not a big issue. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
111,1223,"Sep 11 2008 	great location	I can'y say enough about the location of this hotel for its price catagory. You are so close to many tourist destinations. My wife and I stayed here for her birthday and loved it. You couldn't beat the rate that I found on Orbitz and for the price we paid I was more than satisfied. At the time we stayed here there was no restaurant on premise but many choices nearby. Accross the street is a great pub called &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; good place to grab a pint and some pub food. Also, in the alley way between the Charing Cross and Embankment statios are many great places for a pint or quick bite to eat. On a nice afternoon it gets packed with people just getting out of work and socailizing before hopping on the tube. Barely two blocks away is the Charing Cross train station with access to the Bakerloo and Northern lines, not far away are the Leicester Sqare and Embankment stattions so tube access is great. The rooms are on the smaller side but what do you expect from a hotel of this price in London. The only problem we had was the desk failed to call ahead for our cab the day of departure and ended up using a car service they called. Long story short, the driver was incompitent, we hit mad city traffic and we missed our flight. Make sure you check and double check with the desk that your ride is there on time."
112,1223,"Aug 31 2008 	Great choice	First, you have to be a member of Club Quarters to stay there. So, we stayed at The Grand. From what I could tell, they are the same hotel. I recommend the hotel very much. It was clean and the room was larger than I expected. There is free internet, although we did have some trouble connecting the last couple of days we were there. The other reason to stay here is the location- half block from Trafalgar Square and Parliment; a 5 min. walk to the London Eye and Buckingham Palace. We couldn't have asked for a better location.I wouldn't recommend Garfunkels next door or the Sherlock Holmes, across the street. However, Thai Square (on Trafalgar) was absolutely fantastic."
113,1223,"Aug 31 2008 	Great Hotel	We stayed here for two nights 29th 30th August we booked through Londontown.com and what a find this place is.. perfect location, staff very helpful, rooms have everything you need and more, although small but to be expected in London.. We paid 99 per night which is fantastic value, its a shame they don't do bed and breakfast! maybe that will come in time...This hotel is very security minded with a key card for everything from using the lifts to using the toilets after check out.. All in all a great hotel and we will be back soon... Thank you"
114,1223,"Aug 27 2008 	Great find	This hotel is great value for money. We had a wonderful stay and couldn't have been in a better position. If you can get a room on the top floor at the back you will have views of Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. There is a Garfunkles just up the road with the normal plastic meals, but if you fancy something more traditional go to the Sherlock Holmes which is almost opposite the hotel. Great Treacle pudding !"
115,1223,"Aug 26 2008 	Excellent central london hotel	Stayed for 1 night and found this hotel in a perfect location for sightseeing in london.Paid the cheapest rate i have ever paid for a room so central in london i thought there must have been a catch.but was suprised to say no catch at all,just a fabulous deal!Tastefully furnished,comfortable rooms and exceptionally well cleaned nothing out of place,never heard or seen the maids but all i can say is what a great job they do.Excellent bed/pillows and a lot of thought had been given to the extra touches and details that made this hotel an excellent choice.Had a great sleep as it was so comfortable and quiet.Free internet browsing via the tv.Had a microwave a fridge in room and cd player.Very quiet at all times and had excellent air con, as it was a warm day i used this.Extra touches like ice and water machines on every floor free of charge fantastic.Only criticism would be the bathroom towels are small even for me being petite would have preferred larger towels however i would return to this hotel without any doubt at all next time i am in london i highly recomment this hotel."
116,1223,"Aug 14 2008	Good Value	We stayed on a Sat and Sun night in early June. Got an excellent rate on Hotwire. Hotel was clean and modern. The rooms were large and had flat screen TVs. The lounge for Club members only was annoying, no one was in there, yet we weren't allowed.Great location to the tube and all the sights. Garfunkels restraunt next door was nice, went for breakfast and we ended up back there for dinner.Best part is the free waterbottles and water dispensers. Bottled water can be expensive when you buy it!"
117,1223,"Aug 13 2008 	Clean and Simple	I stayed at The Grand (also known as Club Quarters) for 3 days on business. The hotel seems newly remodeled and clean. The staff was very friendly.Upon check-in, we were offered an &quot;upgrade&quot; for 45 pounds. All this added was a microwave, mini-fridge and tea kettle. In hindsight, it was not worth it.Our first room had a view of the main street, but too much street noise for my taste. We switched to a room in the back of the hotel, and it was much better for sleeping. The beds were a little hard in both rooms.Location to Trafalgar Square was good since the hotel has no restaurant or bar. We arrived about 10pm and had limited choices for meals. Most places close by 10pm, with a few open to 11pm.The hotel does offer a continental breakfast for 18 pounds. We were confused at first because there are no signs that clearly state this. It looks like a complementary spread. Only coffee and tea are free.My only real complaint was the elevators, or lifts as they call them, require you to insert your room key for any floor. Out of the 6 keys that we had, only 1 worked in the elevator. Other guests we spoke to complained about the same experience. Even to go down to the lobby, one needs to insert key."
118,1223,Aug 1 2008 	Great stay and location	Great location and stay! The Grand was clean and accommodating. I'd highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a business or pleasure trip!
119,1223,"Aug 1 2008	Mixed	I stayed at the Club Quarters in Trafalgar for two weeks while traveling for work. My experience was mixed. The room prices are a pretty good deal for the location.The pros: Close to subway (Charing Cross and Embankment)Close to Covent Garden / Leicester Square (pretty much a good central location in London)Comfortable bed, sheets, pillowsCleanThe cons may not be an issue for many travelers, but were for me as I travel quite a bit for work and like to be comfortable when away from home. At the time of my visit, there was no restaurant on site. This means no real room service: there is a food delivery service that the hotel recommends where you place your order over the phone and they deliver to the hotel and add the bill to your room charge. But there can be problems with this if your order is wrong (as I experienced); hotel doesn't really help resolve. It is better to eat out or go to Marks &amp; Spencer at Charing Cross. Again, not an issue if you're on vacation and eat out anyway. But if you need room service from time to time, it can be quite frustrating.  I booked a 1 room suite, but when I arrived I was given no a &quot;superior room&quot; that was narrow and dark with a small window. I asked for another and was given the room across the way: more open with a kitchenette, but with a very small window (about 1.5 feet across). I accepted the room, but wondered what happened to my &quot;1 room suite.&quot; Reception told me that &quot;they&quot; changed my reservation (not sure who &quot;they&quot; is). I called my work travel group and was told that my reservation was not changed. I read through other Trip Advisor reviews and someone else had the same issue with a 1 room suite where the hotel claimed someone had changed the reservations. It may be that they don't have enough 1 room suites for the demand but continue to advertise them as available and then just put you in a &quot;superior room&quot; when you arrive. Just make sure they adjust your room rate accordingly. My room did not have an ergonomic chair (as was advertised), but one was brought when I asked for it. Bathroom was clean, but the shower curtain needed changing more often (mildew). I couldn't get wireless service in my room, but there is wired access (ask for a network cable if not already in the room). Internet is complimentary. Elevator was out of order a couple of days. The electricity in the building went out a couple of times. Bring your own shampoo / conditioner, as the one they provide is not very good quality. There is an ice machine and amenity closet on each floor and a purified water machine where you can fill water bottles for drinking. The 1 washer and 1 dryer on the third floor is free, but busy....buy / bring your own laundry detergent. Other reviewers mentioned umbrellas in the rooms, but mine had none. No in-room safe. Overall, quite decent for the money. But if you're looking for a higher level or service from your hotel, it's best to stay elsewhere."
120,1223,"Jul 28 2008 	Great stay overall	I was very doubtful of this property based on the great price we obtained on their website. London is expensive and we have visited many times. With the current exchange rate, our usual hotels were closer to $900 a night, so we decided to look elsewhere. Found this one here on Tripadvisor. The location is very convenient to central London (not the West End shopping areas, though.) It's shouting distance to the National Gallery, The London Aquarium and sits in between to very good Tube stops. I would highly recommend this hotel. The only flaw? They forgot to service the room the first day we went out and the room didn't have the right number of towels for three people (hubby, me and daughter.) However, they have a guest supply closet you can get some things from and a spring water fountain and bottles for guests. There is no restaurant for non-club members (this hotel has a club program mostly for business travelers and they receive special privileges.) GREAT space in room for a double sofa bed and a queen size bed, desk, armoire and space to leave luggage and still walk around. Bathroom a bit on the small side, however. Also, ask for a room not facing the street if you need quiet."
121,1223,"Jul 27 2008 	Consistently perfect	Just returned from another seven-night stay and again the hotel staff and ammenities exceeded expectations start to finish. Have stayed at Club Quarters Trafalgar Square for 30+ nights in past six months and anytime I've made a request regards anything, the staff from housekeeping to front desk have been quick to help and make any arrangements. This includes a room fridge and stepping machine being bought ot my room within five minutes. When my AC was on the blink, got it fixed asap. What amazed me this past stay, is the courtesy of all front desk staff. They make checking in a breeze and hassle free and truly seem to love their job as they smile and appear genuinely interested. Highlights for me are always the cleanliness of the entire building and rooms. The bathrooms are relatively small, but shower has superb water pressure. Flat screen tv's can be angled for viewing from bed or chair seating. Room includes coffee/tea facilities. Complimentary umbrella in room. All nine hotel floors have bottled spring water available near elevator for guests along with a 'supply' closet that is a nice touch. I have used the same-day laundry service and excellent value for the convenience. Having previously stayed at the five-star Sofitel nearby in Waterloo Place, this quality hotel is a gem and truly exceptional value at WELL under half the price and you get more included. One comparison, at other hotels, rare to get complimetary internet access and Club Quaters have several options for that. Obviously, perhaps the best 'selling point' is the location as it truly can't be beat as on the doorstep of everything that is anything London. Can get to the hotel in 45 minutes from Heathrow via Heathrow Express to Paddington then Bakerloo Line to Embankment and a short 5 minute walk up Northumberland Avenue. Club Quarters really is a treasure that has been buried too long and easily deserves a higher ranking in all London hotels at Trip Advisors."
122,1223,Jul 26 2008 	Location Location Location	We stayed for one night for a short break in the capital. Club Quarters Trafalgar Square is in the perfect location for exploring all that London has to offer. The hotel is spotlessly clean and has a recently refurbished feel - plush carpets and high quality furnishings. The staff are very professional and accomodating and check-in and out was faultless. The lifts are a bit comical but didn't detract from a great overall experience. You would be hard pressed to get a nicer hotel in a better location for the price (check out the londontown website for a great weekend rate).
123,1223,"Jul 24 2008 	Fabulous locations and amenities	My husband and daughter (12) joined me for the first part of my stay as we combined business with a holiday. We paid for an upgrade which got us a larger room with a tiny kitchenette. My daughter slept in a sofa bed converted from a single armchair - it was perfectly comfortable. With the sofa-bed out it did not leave us a lot of room and we had only two useable chairs. Other than that it was fine. The kitchenette enabled us to self-cater our breakfasts (the savings basically paid for the upgrade) - I recommend using the M&amp;S store at Charing Cross station for supplies as they have a better range than the Tesco Express on the corner). We particularly loved the water dispenser (more money saved), the self-serve amenities cupboard and the laundry area. Free internet in rooms was great too - it is still not a normal offering in UK hotels. Plenty of TV channels, not just the fre-to-air ones that you sometimes get. Seems a lot of thought has been put into what people really want in a hotel. My company is a &quot;club member&quot; so we used the lounge on the ground floor a couple of times - it was excellent with happy hour, internet access, comfy chairs etc.The staff were all very good and I saw none of the behaviour or attitude reported by other reviewers. After my family left I moved to a downgraded room. I was given a disabled room (I am not disabled), but it was more spacious than normal so I was happy. I particularly like the MP3 connection to play music through the TV speakers.Two really small complaints - the air-con was inadequate and we did feel quite warm especially at night. Couldn't leave the windows open due to street noise (not really noticeable when the windows were closed). The other tiny problem is that there is no in-room safe, but there are free safe-deposit boxes in reception.The real highlight though is the location - a few steps away from Trafalgar Square and close to so many wonderful sights. The tube stations (two to choose from) are also close to take you wherever you need to go. The room rates are very reasonable. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and I expect to stay there next time I am in London."
124,1223,"Jul 23 2008	A little bit of luxury	Trafalgar Square is on the doorstep. The Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey are a short (and very interesting ) walk from the front door.The only word for the location is UNBEATABLE.The hotel shares a building with The Grand. The lobby is what one would expect of a 'Grand' hotel.One of the best things about the building is the thickness of the carpets in the corridors which absorb all sound. Unusual for a hotel in a city centre over a weekend, we did not hear one single sound from other guests...no doors opening or closing, no footsteps outside the room, nothing.The windows are double glazed against the traffic sound and are pretty effective. Rooms are high-ceilinged, beautifully finished and equipped to high standard with internet access available on the flat screen TV. (Keyboard is in a drawer.) This proved handy when we were looking for restaurants. The service is rather impersonal, but the response to our our only problem was swift. (There was no sound on the TV when we arrived.) We paid just over 500 for three nights, not cheap, but this included a 10 per night charge for an extra bed in the double room. Where else in London could an adult stay in such style for so little money? We went out for breakfast. There are plenty of places to eat all around...Garfunkels, The Old Shades pub etc. My only complaint was a communication problem when booking. I tried to book a studio room, I thought I had booked a studio room but had a doubt, I phoned back to check that it was, and spoke to someone who was charming but not a native English speaker. It was not until we opened the door of the room that we found it was NOT a studio. (The hotel was fully booked.) Given the location, the comfort, and the sheer pleasure of spending a weekend in London our disappointment did not last long.Staying at 8 Northumberalnd Avenue has spoiled me for any other location in the capital. I would rather spend a few days here than a longer time anywhere else."
125,1223,"Jul 21 2008 	No worries.	Stayed for two nights (11 and 12 July) while my girlfriend and I went to London for a gig at Somerset House. The reviews I read of this hotel made me a little wary (re: harsh staff and problems with lifts and key cards and stuff), but the location sounded like just the ticket.I booked through londontown.com which was a good experience.I emailed the hotel in advance of our stay to confirm that they had received the booking and they replied promptly.Firstly, I checked in using their automated system that just swipes your credit card and issues you with your room card(s) - I took two in case we had the (previously highlighted) lift problems.The room was immaculate - totally clean and fresh..... no bath but a good sized, powerful, walk-in shower..... good tv with free internet, usual coffee and tea stuff.......Bonuses = free purified water and bottles (on every floor by the lifts).... Free ice and ice buckets (by the water machines)..... umbrella for customer use in every room - five quid charge if you nick it!!Settled in and fancied an extra pillow..... asked one of the many, friendly, staff who were servicing our floor and they brought me one within the hour.No view from the small window in the room.Checked out via the very simple automated service - just swipe your room key and then post them back through the slot.Location - superb. Everything within easy reach. This hotel makes a really superb base for exploring the sights and sounds of London.Suggestions = breakfast at Garfunkels (nearby) or try the &quot;breakfast club&quot; in Soho for a great vegetarian cooked breakfast. Drink some good beer (a real rarity in London!!!) at Chandos - only a couple of minutes walk from the hotel or drink Guinness at the Toucan in Soho!!I recommend this hotel to anyone - I didn't risk being disappointed by having to deal with surly staff by completely cutting them out of the equation.I've paid a lot more for a lot less!!"
126,1223,"Jul 20 2008 	Good Value Great Location	Booked this hotel after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. Very happy with our decision. The hotel is in a great location. Just steps from Embankment and Charing Cross tube stations. Hotel lobby is smaller than expected, but the rooms were clean and well kept. Staff seemed nice, but we didn't use them much. Couple of decent restaurants close by, but we walked towards Piccadilly for most of our meals. The kitchy Sherlock Holmes Pub is right across the street. Trafalgar Square is steps away and the bridge leading to the London Eye, with views of Parliament and Big Ben are just down the street.Room was a bit small, but not by European standards. I would add that this hotel was still in the process of putting in a bar and restaurant, if that's important.The hotel also has free washer and dryers, which if London hadn't been our first destination, we definitely would have taken advantage of. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind short walks and making use of the tube, which we did. Although we did pass through Kensington and Hyde Park, which if we go to London again, we may try out. The streets were clean with more restaurants and shops. Again, the tube was so easy to use and so much cheaper than taxis, being a bit away from the attractions woldn't be that big of a deal."
127,1223,"Jul 15 2008 	At London center just great	Great location, service, rooms, facilities... I loved this hotel... it made our stay easier, comfortable and enjoyable..."
128,1223,"Jul 13 2008 	Great Hotel real high class experience for great value prices!!	Booked this hotel for the location and reputed business-class experience offered at reasonable prices for London.LocationFanstastic location at no.8 northumberland Avenue just off of Trafalgar Square(nearest tube station is Charing Cross).Rooms &amp; FacilitiesFantastic finish and size with excellent services(free internet with wireless keyboard, flat screen TV, range of gadget connections, network cable, mp3 etc). Bed was very comfy and the bathroom was excellently finished with a real high-end feel to it. There was a complimentary chilled water dispenser in the corridor with a fresh plastic bottle per customer (meant we could take water with us every day we were out in London) and complimentary ice-bucket and ice-dispenser also available.StaffNever had much dealing with them apart from when we checked in/out but they were very efficient(we arrived 30mins earlier than the 3pm check-in and there was no hassle in allocating us a room). Maybe them being pitched at the business market means that the perform a functional type person service rather than a more touristy approach to clients?BreakfastOne tip that I read before going was that as told by the hotel, their continental breakfast was 9.95pp, but we were already armed with the knowledge that if you don't mind eating in a chain pub that there was a Wetherspoons less than 2mins walk away from the hotel.RecommendIf you don't need a person service and want an excellent hotel to stay in with an amazing location then I'd strongly recommend a visit to them, and I will definitely return to stay with them next time we are in London"
129,1223,"Jul 11 2008 	Central Location Comfortable accommodation.	We just needed a one night stop at a London hotel, after watching a concert at the O2 arena. The Grand proved to be a great choice, at a central location within walking distance of Waterloo station, and minutes from Leicester Square. Despite a not so smooth check in, we were pleased with our rooms, a good size for a London hotel, with a clean and modern bathroom. Our friends had a room at the back of the building which got virtualy no natural sunlight, however they commented that they had one of the best nights sleep for a long time! The rooms were nicely furnished, down to the umbrella in the wardrobe!Its disappointing there is no restaurant, but we had little trouble finding breakfast nearby - and certainly didn't have to pay hotel prices.In all I would absolutely recommend this 'hotel', at the bottom of the street is the boat stop for direct ferries to the O2, and were able to walk through most of Westminster, Piccadily, leicester Square area with little problem. A great find, for a very reasonable price!"
130,1223,"Jul 7 2008 	Club Quarters A Top Hotel In A Perfect Location	My husband and myself went on a two day trip to London and after searching for what seems forever ,we came across this hotel .Club Quarters Trafalgar was a real find in more ways then one .First the location was perfect for sight seeing ,it is of course as the name suggests beside Trafalgar square which is a hive of activitity .Big Ben ,Buckingham Palace ,The London Eye ,Houses of Parliament ,China town ,West end theatres and so much more are all within walking distance.There are endless places to dine out in and most of Londons famous shops are within walking distance or a short cab /tube trip away.The hotel itself is a lovely building ,friendly ,helpful staff .The rooms are well set out and spotlessly clean .Rooms are well equiped for internet etc.Bottled water ice etc is available complimentaryThe automated express check in and out is extremely handy .I expected that with such a central location that it would be noisy but we had no such problem .We hope to return again to this Hotel and will certainly recommend staying here to our family and friends ."
131,1223,"Jul 6 2008 	Good Stay	This Hotel was really nice, Defiantely had plenty of room, flat screen, a/c, etc. The bed was clean and cozy. We were in a great location, walking distance to Picadilly Circus and train was nearby. It was a pleasent stay. The staff were a bunch of snobs though. I realized quicly that I should not ask too many questions and just enjoy my stay. The hotel had a computer with internet access for free in the lobby. And interet access was free also. It was a good price and if you go to London I would recommend this hotel. I would probably stay there again. The staff needs work with their attitudes. It was not one person but overall 3 staff members that were a little abrasive with me for no reason. OVerall, the htoel itself was good."
132,1223,"Jul 4 2008 	Location is Prime!	The location is the best part of this hotel! You can't go wrong staying here for your trip to London. We did have some initial problems--we had to change rooms twice, HOWEVER, the staff could NOT have been more accomodating, (First room too noisy, second room had NO AC, third was PERFECT), they were very helpful and kind in our requests. Once we got past that in the first 24 hours, we had an excellent time. Check in/Check out a breeze, water near elevators is excellent, and although the elevator access was a bit tricky at times, not a showstopper. Highly recomend for all!"
133,1223,"Jul 4 2008 	Central location	If you are a Club Quarters member, this is a fantastic deal under their special weekend rates. The price we paid for a weekend was comparable to a one or two star B&amp;B. The Trafalgar Square property was in a great location, the rooms were large, and was more convenient than waking up a B&amp;B owner for a late night arrival. We will definitely stay here again under the special rate."
134,1223,"Jul 3 2008 	The Grand Was Not Bad at All....	My husband and I stayed at The Grand at Trafalgar Square from June 20 to June 22, 2008. We got a great deal from Hotwire - $129US per night. The Grand was just a few blocks from Embankment tube station and was quite easy for us to locate, despite the fact we hardly slept on our red-eye flight from Toronto. Check-in was quick and our room was ready upon our arrival at 12:30pm. As other reviewers have mentioned, the room key is required to access the elevator and was a little finicky each time we went upstairs to our room on the third floor. The room was very clean and a good size for London, with a queen size bed, wardrobe, desk, two chairs and a flat screen television. I think all Hotwire travelers seem to get the same room at the Grand, because our room looked exactly the same as previous Hotwire reviewers photos and had absolutely no view from the window. Not a big deal for us, but its nice to be able to check the weather (i.e., windy, rainy) by looking out the window at people below which we were not able to do.The bathroom was a little small with only a shower stall, no bathtub, but was large enough that you didnt feel cramped. Toiletries included bar soap, bath gel and conditioning shampoo (I brought my own travel size shampoo and conditioners as I dont care for the two-in-ones). Maid service was great  room was properly cleaned and towels replenished each day. We quite appreciated the water service on our floor with plastic bottles to take out with you for the day. Breakfast was not included in our stay, so we did not sample what The Grand had to offer for food. Overall, I would say The Grand at Trafalgar Square is a pleasant hotel with a very central location ideal for tourists in London. The low price we paid was a definite plus  not sure I would have felt great about paying full price for this particular room."
135,1223,"Jul 1 2008 	Excellent	My husband and I have just returned from a 4-day break in London, having stayed at the Club Quarters Hotel and we were very impressed. First of all, check-in was very easy. Staff were busy with other customers on our arrival so we used the simple self-service check-in machine. You just supply your credt card and details and it gives you your key card and room number. We also used this process to check out. Very convenient. We had a room on the 6th floor and it was immaculately clean and very modern. The view wasn't good as we had a room to the rear of the hotel but then this is London and if you want rolling hills and countryside, maybe the Lake District is more suited. There was a flat screen TV and free internet access that you can access via the TV. There were also the usual accessories e.g hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities etc, plus an umbrella which I thought was a nice added touch and have never known a hotel do this in individual rooms before. The bed was really comfy but we were only supplied with one pillow each. We just left a note for room service though and we were left with some extra ones for the following night. The bathroom was also extremely clean and no mould in the tiles or on the shower curtain which I have often found in hotels and find it quite off-putting. There were very basic toiletries supplied- shampoo and shower gel and towels were changed every other day. Breakfast was offered to us on arrival (approx 9 per person) but we never ate in the hotel as we prefer finding our own eateries. The location of the hotel was superb - right opposite Trafalgar Sqaure and only a short walk away from Buckingham Palace, London Eye and other attractions. There were also numerous places to eat just round the corner. We sampled Garfunkels (a couple of doors down) american style diner a couple of times for tea and breakfast and found the service and food very good. Another point I mustn't miss off is the water machines on every floor of the hotel. Plastic water bottles are provided FREE of charge so you can fill them up whenever you like from the machine. We found this extremely useful and a much better idea than charging customers extortionate prices for a bottle of Evian or something similar left in customers' rooms. We paid just over 400 for our stay, including taxes which I thought was very reasonable. The location, service and standard of hotel couldn't have been better for the money, especially compared to other hotels we had looked at."
136,1223,"Jul 1 2008 	A nice ""hotel"" with a few problems	Got a good deal on this hotel on hotwire.com. Building impressive on the outside and the lobby area is certainly very grand. Actual check in and desk area is tiny and not very business like.Lifts to the rooms are a lottery. Operated by your room key sometimes they recognised the key, other times not. Lifts have a capacity of 6 people and dont overload them. Our full lift was barged by 2 gentlemen and it resulted in 5 scary minutes of the lift going up and down without stopping. Alarm had been sounded and eventually the lift stopped but it was the first time I had ever experienced a lift malfunction and it wasnt fun.Our room was a decent size. Huge comfortable bed was a winner. Room had a desk and chair, a flat screen TV and a media panel with mp3 connector. Alas our mp3 connection did not work. When we called reception they sent someone up who couldnt fix it either. We were told maintenance would sort it the next day and that didnt happen so we just gave up on it. Couldnt pick up the promised wifi signal in the room but there was free keyboard Internet via the TV so we werent totally Internet free.Tee &amp; Coffee in the room, free chilled water on each floor and guest supply closets for the likes of irons, extra pillows, top up coffees etc. If you do want extra pillows, go to the closet early, they tended to be gone by evening.Bathroom is the smallest Ive had in a London hotel. No bath, just a walk in shower. Weak pressure but not the worst Ive encountered. Towels supplied are definitely on the small side. Decent worktop space for toiletries but the big no no was the hotel toiletries supplied. Went to open one of the hand soaps when I saw pure palm oil emblazoned across the label. Palm oil is one of the most politically incorrect ingredients out there. The Orang Utan is being driven to the edge of extinction in Asia because of these plantations. Im no crazy environmentalist but it horrified me that this 4 star establishment had toiletries that contain palm oil. Bar and restaurant still not open in the hotel despite their website saying Spring 2008. The other couple with us had breakfast in the hotel, which they said was ok. That was until they realised it was 9 per person. They hadnt read the info properly where it said 4.95 for Club Members and 9 for non-members. This breakfast (continental) is not worth 9. Theres a Garfunkels (restaurant) within 100 metres of the hotel as well as a Tesco (supermarket) so save your money!Location of the hotel is amazing. Walking distance to many sights and theatres and less than 5 minutes from the well connected Embankment tube station. Well definitely be back!"
137,1223,"Jun 29 2008 	New hotel excellent location.	Just stayed at this hotel, and having stayed here last year, too, knew what an excellent hotel this was. The location is almost unbeatable. When I woke up in the morning, I could hear the sound of Big Ben. Nice!The hotel is new, and everything still feels fresh. Some say they had problems with the elevator. I did not.I arrived at 9.30 in the evening, and check-in could not have been quicker. But when I passed the reception the next days, there seemed to be people waiting for check-in/out both morning and afternoon. Seemed they could do with more people in the reception at times.The room was at 7th floor with view over the rooftops, and was well equipped with what one needs.Room and bath clean, and as said everything is new and not worn out.I did not have breakfast at the hotel ,so cannot say anything about that."
138,1223,"Jun 26 2008 	Fantastic location Lots of little extras	We were originally planning to stay at a basic 2-star hotel to save some money, but the Hotwire deal we got for this hotel made it even cheaper than the less-central 2-star places we'd been considering!The Trafalgar Square location was extremely convenient for sightseeing, with a short walk to Westminster and Parliament, a short walk to Buckingham Palace, an easy walk to the British Museum, and barely a block to the National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, and Horse Guards Parade. For longer trips, the Embakment underground station was just down the street and offers immediate access to the Circle/District lines (for Tower of London, St.Paul's, etc).The hotel has much of the impersonal atmosphere of a business hotel, but unlike so many, there were lots of unexpected included extras. The free internet access in the room was a great surprise (though it took us a while to realize the keyboard was in one the bedside tables). The bottled water dispensers were a pleasant and ecologically-friendly surprise for summer tourism. And I realized too late (as we were packing to check out) that there were actually a few London guidebooks and novels to borrow in the room! It would have been nice to have an included breakfast, but there was a small grocery on the corner to grab a snack or a drink.Our room was quite spacious with room for two arm chairs and a small table in addition to the double bed and desk. There was enough floor space in the seating area to open out more than one suitcase. The decor was non-descript but modern and tasteful.The hotel lounge seemed like a comfortable place to sit, and it was usually empty except for the area around the computer terminal. One thing that was a bit annoying is that this is the only computer (aside from the room TVs) that was available to us. It seems that the business center was reserved for Club Quarters members rather than all guests. The room TV was handy, but we did find the mouse-replacement on the keyboard a bit difficult to use efficiently, causing us to turn to the public machine with a real mouse for urgent tasks (like looking up at the last minute an address we'd forgotten to bring along).Our only big issue was with the elevators, which required your room key to access and was a bit temperamental. It seemed that a lot of people had trouble getting the system to work the first time. Also, they were fairly small and during peak times, we had to wait through a few full elevators before finding space (so plan a few minutes extra if you're in a rush)."
139,1223,"Jun 20 2008 	Excellent location	We had an excellent rate via hotwire! The hotel is well located near several tube stations, buses and major monuments in London. The room is small (for the price) and we had a bad view. The flat TV and keyboard (furnished) that can utilised to bowse internet is a plus. There is no fridge in the room though, for us travelling with a baby is a bit unconfortable. The shared facilities (water dispenser and bottles, coffee, tea maker in 2nd floor) can be an excellent choice but a washing machine ... I wonder who use it. Overall, I recommend this hotel for the great location."
140,1223,"Jun 15 2008 	Excellent Hotel	Excellent hotel with a unbeatable location. Tube station, 2 min away, london eye, big ben etc are all within a 15 min walking distance. Sherlock Homes pub right down the street. Hop on hop off tour bus stop right in front of the hotel and takes you everywhere in London, Traf sq just 2 min walk.Very good breakfast with a vast selecion of fresh fruits. Free internet and printing. Also offers free filltered and chilled drinking water and bottles on every floor next to the elevators so you dont have tp waste 2-3 pounds buying a bottle of water at tourist joints.Rooms had a new and fresh feel to them. Nice flat screen tv, bathroom slightly compact but was acceptable. Were given an early check in for no extra charge and hotel also has a store for keeping luggage which we used as we were catching a flight late evening and checked out early morning, roamed around came back picked up our luggage and went to the airport. Would rate it a 10/10."
141,1223,"Jun 14 2008 	Grandly frustrated	Gee whiz did we suffer some frustration (and by the line at reception we were not alone). Booking, credit card authorisation procedures and the knowledge of the staff at reception were all questionnable. On the plus side it is a great location. Just at the end of the day, I wish the service had been better/"
142,1223,"Jun 14 2008 	Ideal Lodging - couldn't be better!	Booked my three day stay in this hotel based on reviews I read from this TripAdvisor website. I was not disappointed. For my brief stay in London it was ideal! Centrally located, clean, free wi-fi, with a friendly staff who were very helpful. I will return for sure."
143,1223,"Jun 1 2008	Great Location and Experience	I am not sure if some of the posters here stayed at the same Grand at Trafalgar that I stayed. The service was outstanding, we arrived at the hotel almost 4 hours before our check-in time, after a 8hr overnight flight from the US. I used this hotel as a one day stop on my way to Dover to catch our cruise ship.The manager not only allowed us to occupy the room early, he upgraded my room without me asking. I mentioned in passing that I had found his hotel thru tripadvisor and he immediately commented that the staff at the hotel monitored the postings here. Also, the hotel was one of the better priced hotels I had during my holiday in England. I purchased the hotel thru Hotwire for $93.00 a night, which I think is a bargain for central London.The hotel is located 75 yards from the Charing Cross tube stop and is only 150 yards from the Thames. The room was clean and had free WIFI internet access. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend as a base to sight see in London? 100% YES.Regards,Ben"
144,1223,"May 15 2008 	Very good location but small room	We've just returned from a 3 day-stay and this hotel is a really top location (Next to Trafalgar Sq, Charing Cross and Embankement Tube Station, pubs, restaurants...) in central London.We've booked through [--] and got a Standard Double room for 84 + taxes per night.The room itself was nicely appointed, on the 8th floor, with flat Screen TV, Internet acces (didn't use), shower, nice queen bed and view on Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.The only &quot;bad&quot; thing is the size of the room. Not large, not small but ok for 2 and 2 luggages. Noisy aeration outside the window. Free Water in the Corridor with PET-bottle and Ice!Otherwise a good choice only if you can get a good price."
145,1223,"May 14 2008 	Awesome Location!!	We were pleased with this hotel and we recommend it to anyone who is looking for a central location in London, but not so particular about good service. We definitely got our moneys worth and we appreciated the complementary amenities. We agree with the previous reviews: location the excellent, but the service was poor. However, the pros definitely outweighed the cons. PROS:1. Awesome location - steps from trafalgar square, 15 minute walk to the London Eye and Westminister Abbey/Big Ben, 20 minutes to Picadilly Circus and Buckingham Palace, Charing Cross rail station 5 minutes. Chinatown is about a 10 minute walk north of the National Gallery. Grocery store and restaurants right around the corner (also near Charing Cross Rail Station). City bus and On-Off bus stops are in front of the hotel. 2. Complementary coffee, filtered-water, high speed internet - There are filtered-water dispensers on each floor and the hotel provides new empty bottles for your water. Coffee is found on the 2nd floor and is available all day long. High speed internet is available in the guest rooms and a computer connected to a printer will allow you to print at no cost on the 2nd floor. 3. Rooms - Very clean and contemporary. Our room had a microwave and a small refrigerator. This was most helpful in a pricy city. We bought microwaveable food from the Tesco down the street and nuked it our room. We had a view of Big Ben, the London Eye, and the top of Westminister Abbey from our room on the 9th floor. Also, there are history books and London travel books in the room for guest to read. The hotel also provided an umbrella in each room for the unpredictable London weather (it actually snowed on our first day there and the umbrella was a lifesaver).4. Other Hotel Amenities - A small laundry room is available on the 3rd floor at no cost, great for the light packer. There is a vending machine in the same area. CONS:1. Service - The front desk was a hit and miss. One concierge was not very helpful. He always sounded annoyed. It was easier to look up the information ourselves on the internet. On our last day we checked-in our luggage at the front desk and upon picking it up we were guided to a back room where all the checked luggage were stored to get our own luggage. 2. Room Heater - On 2 out of our 4 night stay, the heater was working and the other 2 nights it was not (although, the temperature in the room was comfortable). It seemed as though the heat was shunted to different parts of the hotel on different days. Our friends who were on the 2nd floor had heat on the days we did not. 2. Elevators - Guests need to insert their room key into the slot before pressing the number of the floor. We often met other guests in the elevator on the 9th floor who were trying to get to the first floor. It was nice to know that we were not alone. (Not a big deal, though).3. Room doorknobs - I'm only 5'3'' and I had a hard time opening the guest room door because the doorknob is placed very low on the door. 4. Hotel house phones - there were no hotel house phones in common areas (ie. the lobby, 2nd floor, etc). We asked the front desk if we could call another guest in their room from the front desk phone since we were in the lobby, we were told by the concierge that we had to go back to our room (which was on the 9th floor) to make such a call. If we were to go back to london, we'd probably stay here again since the location was excellent, the price was very reasonable, and the amenities were convenient. But we'd probably look elsewhere if we were looking for excellent service."
146,1223,"May 8 2008 	Great location and lovely hotel	The hotel is situated about 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square. The setting of the hotel is very good with the impression that it is going to be something special The reception area is small with no amenities other than a check in desk.Check in was fast and both lifts were in working order.On the 2nd floor was a lounge with free tea and coffee. At the entrance to each floor as you exit the lifts there are complimentary ice machines for crushed ice or cold water and a residents locker for extra towels and pillows. The use of this has to be requested via the reception.The room was excellent though a bit small as a family room. Free internet via the TV, microwave and climate control. The third bed was a sofa chair that would be ok for the under 12s.We did not have breakfast in the hotel but used the restaurant on the corner which did a good cooked breakfast at about 5 pounds.For drinks at night we bought wine from the local Tescos which is only a 2 minute walk away and as the room had a fridge drinks could be kept cold.This hotel is excellent for visiting all the west end attractions and given its location i think is good value for money.We would definitley stay again."
147,1223,"May 8 2008 	Not so grand but okay	Probably once quite grand, renovations have stripped most of the grandeur away. If you look closely you will notice signs of its once elegant former self, like the marble staircase in the center, which can easily be missed if you take the elevator. It's clean and perfectly adequate but there's not much that's memorable about it. A colleague stayed in a room with more charm and original details than my square box, so the rooms may vary quite dramatically. It's so self-serve you barely see any staff. The location is convenient -- at Trafalgar Square and very near Covent Garden. I liked the filtered water machines in the hallway. I did not like the horrifying cab ride to Kensington that was arranged by the hotel. It was the driver's first day (I believe in London, not just driving a cab) and his navigation system didn't work. Enough said, but I learned the hard way to NEVER take any cab that isn't a Black Cab -- this particular cab was green and operated by who knows what cab company."
148,1223,"May 7 2008 	Great hotel great location	My wife and I had a 4-night stay at the Club Quarters Trafalgar Square (May 2-5 2008) and really have nothing but good things to say about our stay. We had stayed at another Club Quarters in New York about a year prior and had a good experience there as well. Our room was very clean, with plenty of room and sufficient amenities. The facilities seem very new and nothing is worn out in any way. The one thing that everyone seemed to have trouble with was the elevator. There's a card reader required to operate the elevator that doesn't work really well.The location of this hotel is definitely one of its highlights. We took the Heathrow Express and then the tube to get to the Charing Cross station, which is maybe 2 minutes walking distance to the hotel (Its a busy intersection). From the hotel its only 15 minutes walking to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, most of the theaters, Big Ben and Parliament, The London eye, etc. A tourist visiting London could really not ask for a better location to stay. As for food, there is a reasonably priced (but fancy looking) Italian resturaunt across the street, a generic British resturaunt next door, a Tesco Express at the corner, a great pub across the street, etc. The wireless interent service was a bit spotty in our room (the antennas seem to be on one side of the building), but it did work and was reasonably fast."
149,1223,"May 5 2008	Godd hotel in a GREAT location	Originally wanted to stay at the Jesmond Dene but it was fully booked, so went for this on on its location. You couldn't get more central than this - literally just a few yards off Trafalgar Square and close to both Embankment and Charing Cross tube stations. We were only staying the one night - 2nd May 2008 and wanted somewhere not far from Theatre Royal Drury Lane and Joe Allens in Exeter Street (brilliant for pre-and post-theatre meals). Check-in was easy and automated (if you wanted - just a little instruction needed). Staff at reception very polite and helpful. We had room 511 at the front of the hotel. Sticking my arm out the window I managed to get a fairly good picture of Trafalgar Square and Nelson's column. Our room was spotlessly clean, comfortable and modern. We had a Queen-size bed and armchair which converted into a single bed for our daughter. The &quot;kitchenette&quot; had crockery, cutlery, small sink, kettle, fridge and microwave. Both beds were comfortable with nice linen and towels. The shower was superb! Free chilled water and bottles in the hallways were an added bonus. The only &quot;problems&quot; were: a) the kettle (the lead was loose in the plug - it still worked fine so I mentioned this for health &amp; safety as we were leaving next morning), and b) being woken at 6.00am by traffic noise, but this was CENTRAL London after all. We didn't have the hotel's continental breakfast as we thought 9.90 each was a bit too much. (Go round the corner into Whitehall and just a few yards down on the left is a great old pub called &quot;The Old Shades&quot; where we had a great Full English Breakfast including your choice of hot drink for only 4.95. We went back that evening for steaks too). Overall the hotel is a great choice for comfort and location. The price was 147 without breakfast - but there were three of us so pretty good really. We would recommend this hotel."
150,1223,"Apr 24 2008 	Great central location and reasonably priced business class hotel	I have stayed at the Club Quarters numerous times on business travel. If possible you should have your company activate a membership with CQ. The hotel is the most reasonably priced, centrally located business hotel in London. The rooms are generally well appointed with internet included in the tariff, there are rooms and lounge for meetings, and did I mention that the hotel is centrally located near trafalgar square.The staff are helpful, pleasant, and usually efficient. They have accomodated several requests for changes of room and early check in (with additional tariff). I highly recommend the CQ for business related travel."
151,1223,"Apr 23 2008	Grand-ish	Location is indeed the trump card for this hotel as recurs throughout the reviews. And at the end of the day justifies its choice as a safe, sound and reasonably priced tour base. The hotel is no 'Grand' though- public spaces are minimal, the promised Restaurant/Bar in late 2007 is an untruth requiring an urgent truthful update (no evidence of any progress....), the Lounge is not accessible to pleb visitors (unless you stand swiping looking innocently at your faulty card till a 'club' member takes pity or passes by) (ha!). Breakfast was advertised in the room cheaper than earlier eviews (~6 I think) but had transmogrified to 10 on arrival in the breakfast zone. A tad overpriced for continental. BUT.... my mother who's 60th birthday treat this was had never stayed in a big hotel before, and loved it. Took photos for souvenirs. Felt special. It's all relative..."
152,1223,"Apr 14 2008 	Good location poor service	This hotel is in a great location and for that it cant be faulted.The room was OK, bit dusty in places and overlooked the back of the hotel, so a bit dark and noisy from various vents etc.The one problems which shouldnt really be a problem was there was no air conditioning, this being March and it snowing outside I didnt think it would be a problem.However, the ambient temperature of the room was so warm that the window had to be kept wide open at all time, even through the night which didnt help with the noise. But as youre really only in the room to sleep it did make for a couple of uncomfortable nights.The desk staff couldnt care less and didnt want to move us room due to the rate we were on, they suggested opening the window and did offer a desk fan to help. Although I had to wait 3 hours and chase it twice before it showed.You do get a microwave and fridge in the room and there is ice and bottles of filtered water in the halls which is a nice touch.As this hotel is part of the Club Quarters organisation there are certain facilities that are mentioned in your room that arent available to guest at the The Grand (there are separate reception desks) and you dont get access to the lounge."
153,1223,"Apr 14 2008 	Unsurpassable location and nice rooms	We stayed here March 08. The hotel's location couldn't be better, with Leicester square, Chinatown, Soho, Covent Garden, Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Big Ben and the houses of Parliament all within short walking distances. The rooms were nicely decorated in a modern style and spotlessly clean, although quite small. The hotel building itself is very grand from the street and the staff were smiling and helpful. There's nowhere to eat in the hotel but that's not really a problem with huge numbers of restaurants within a few minutes' walk! Overall we enjoyed our stay here and found it really good value, given the quality of the room and the central location. We'll definitely be staying again next time we're in London."
154,1223,"Apr 9 2008 	Excellent Location	very clean and very large rooms. which is excellent after a long day of touring, plenty of room to rest and relax. very safe area, with everything in walking distance. restaurants ? about 50 within a 15 minute walking radius. we did not have to use the underground , but it is only a 2 minute walk away or get a cab once except to leave. location was perfect . we stayed 7 nights and could have stayed 7 more, and only got a taste of this awesome city. this hotel is a true gem!"
155,1223,"Apr 3 2008 	Great hotel excellent location	My husband and I spent 2 nights at The Grand on a London City break, the hotel's location is excellent. We walked from Waterloo to the hotel and walked to most of the London sights (Leicester Sq, Oxford St, Covent Garden etc).The hotel itself is great - clean, good sized rooms with all the necessary amenities. Complimentary chilled water (in plastic bottles) was a nice extra. room rate was reasonable for a central london hotel.Although it didn't have many communal areas (inc a restaurant - although I know this is due to be opened shortly) this wasn't a problem for us - we wanted to explore the city not sit in hotel room."
156,1223,"Apr 1 2008 	Great location good price basic room	This hotel is in an excellent location and the price is affordable for London, but still expensive at 160 pounds. The rooms are clean and of good size, but ours which was at the back of the hotel was very dark with one window overlooking an alley. The ventilation system is noisy- a problem for those who sleep lightly. We will try another hotel next time even if we must pay a bit more."
157,1223,"Mar 31 2008 	Great Location Decent basic accomodations	This hotel is in a great location steps from Trafalgar Square and both the Charing Cross and Embankment Tube stations. Leiceister Square is only a few blocks away so it's also very convenient to many restaurants and shows. The hotel includes free Internet access, but it was disrupted for a full day during our stay. Additionally the elevators didn't work sometimes, but there was always one in working order.The free filtered water and bottles in the hallway are a nice touch. Breakfast is available for a charge... we went to the Tesco a few doors down and picked up fruit, pop, and breakfast bars instead much more cheaply. Rooms include a refrigerator and microwave too.There are many friendly and affordable pubs near this hotel as well."
158,1223,"Mar 27 2008 	Very nice reliable hotel for tourists and business travelers	I visited this hotel on a business trip and felt it was quite adequate for travelers like myself, or tourists coming from outside the country. The amenities were very nice and similar to that of a large hotel chain. The location was unbeatable - right in the middle of Trafalgar Square. I worked all day, but the locale made it so I could run out at night, anywhere nearby, to photograph beautiful buildings and sites. The breakfast was continental and standard - yogurts, coffee, bread, cheese, meats, etc. The rooms were substantial - just make sure to request one on the street to get that sun into your room. I was on the 2nd floor and heard very little street noise. I would likely not stay here again only because I prefer smaller, more personal hotels. But I would recommend this spot to a family who needs all the amenities of home, or a business traveler working in downtown London."
159,1223,"Mar 25 2008 	A Great Location!	We stayed at The Grand at Trafalgar Square for 4 nights in March and it was terrific. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and accomodating. Our room was spacious and lovely. We were concerned because of some of the reviews that we had read but we felt that our room was very comfortable and spacious (I guess by NYC standards anyway). There were two of us and we were quite comfortable.But the best thing by far was the location. It was so super central to everything that we could walk or take the underground anywhere, conveniently and easily. We went to Buckingham Palace, Piccadily, the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, Kensington Gardens, Harrods, and many other places and it was all very, very easy. The underground (train) was just up the street (Charing Cross) so getting there from Healthrow was a breeze. It was also supereasy to purchase the Oyster Card (for the train) the moment we arrived in Heathrow. All so easy to accomplish.As for our room, it faced the back of the hotel, but this was fine by us because it was sunny (no obstructions) and it was super quiet. We slept soundly with no complaints. The hotel is smart to place spring water fountains on every floor so that you can refill your bottle of water if you'd like.We spent most of our time sightseeing and seeing shows so we didn't spend a lot of time in our room. However, the bathroom facilities were excellent, very clean, and our room was new and very comfortable. Great bed, tv, and very comfortable. The only negative was that the front desk is too small. Because the front desk can really only handle one person (two max) at a time, the line ques up fast and that can be a drag. We were lucky and arrived at a time when no one was on-line, but as soon as we were done, we turned around and the line was long. Not good. They need to enlarge the hotel's front desk and add a few extra chairs to the lobby area as well. Overall though, it was a terrific hotel and we will definitely return!"
160,1223,"Mar 21 2008 	Good value for this postcode.	We were one of three middle-aged couples having a weekend break, and CQ Traf Sq suited our purposes admirably.Staff were very efficient and helpful, rooms were spotless and pleasantly appointed in contemporary style.Location is everything, so close to the heart of the city and many of its attractions; lots of amenities close by.Nothing frilly or pretentious, you wouldn't call it special by any means, just very good value for this part of the world - we'll certainly return."
161,1223,"Mar 19 2008	Great location	We spent two nights in this centrally located hotel, We found it adequate but lacking any kind of atmosphere and the room was on the small side. We had one flattish pillow each and when we requested extra ones we were told none were available. Our bathroom wasn't cleaned after our first night and the toiletries were not replenished. The towels were very small and skimpy. The TV was very basic - no text and not many channels. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but at Garfunkel's, almost next door and paid far less than we would have done at the hotel."
162,1223,"Mar 12 2008 	Better than expected!	Took my Fiancee fo a weekend in London on the 9th March, I spent hours searching on-line for a hotel. I must say we were so impressed with this hotel, Location- Fantastic, Room- Excellent.I was worried we would have a very basic room as I only wanted a standard double as we hadnt planned on staying in the room much, but for 98 it was Awesome! Highly modern, clean, spacious, sat tv, everything you would need for a 1 night stay.Tube only 1 min walk, Traf Square 1 min walk, Leicester Square 5 min walk ,Tesco Express 1 min away, loads of Resturants and good pubs all within 5/10 mins.Overall 10/10!! Highly Recommend.Only negative, Breakfast not included in price, they wanted 9 pp, So we went to the Weatherspoons round the corner 3.69 massive breakfast!!!! Loved it!!"
163,1223,"Mar 7 2008 	Fine.	Nice location and very good price. Overall experience is fine. Not much to complain about, not much to rave about either. The rooms are smallish (and the bathrooms are tiny) but perfectly comfortable. Flat screen TVs, decent lighting. It's only 1/2 a block from the edge of Trafalgar Square and the Charing Cross tube stop. No restaurant in the hotel (they do have a breakfast buffet) although that wasn't an issue for us."
164,1223,"Mar 5 2008 	Excellent location 	After reading many excellent reviews our expectations were high &amp; we were relieved when they were met in every way. Stayed for 3 nights &amp; were a matter of yards from Trafalgar Square so couldn't be more conveniently located for transport links (bus, tube &amp; water ferry all within 5 mins walk) as well as numerous shopping, entertainment &amp; eating options. Super speedy check in, a comfortable room with all the required amenities including an umbrella &amp; hair dryer with a long enough lead to use AND reach the mirror! Basic tea &amp; coffee making, This hotel is specifically equipped for business use rather than tourist &amp; the room had a fridge &amp; microwave but you won't find things like a mini-bar. If you want to spend a lot of time within the hotel then this is probably not perfect but there is now a bar &amp; restaurant (although we didn't even bother to look at them - too much else to do &amp; look at!) Everything was clean through-out the hotel. Staff were helpful - we asked for an extra pillow which had been placed in our room by the time we returned to the hotel later that evening."
165,1223,"Mar 3 2008 	Perfect in London	This hotel is perfect. If you know London and don't want to stay in some chintzy tourist trap, but you want location, cleanliness, modern and (for London) spacious, then this hotel ticks all the boxes.The staff could be considered a little on the perfunctory side, and the actual check in area is cramped and a bit unprepossessing, but the rooms are large, modern, clean and perfect. The American ice and water machine is a lovely touch, and the ironing board and tea and coffee making facilities most appreciated.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who loves to walk London, doesn't need much fuss or advice and wants to be in the thick of things."
166,1223,"Mar 3 2008 	Great location great price	We were a little alarmed when we asked our London cabbie to take us to the Club Quarters Hotel,Trafalgar Square, and he said he didn't know it. London cab drivers famously seem to know every inch of London. But that interaction, best describes the hotel- it goes somewhat unnoticed on the London hotel list. The outside of the hotel is unassuming- no doormen or bellhops. Inside is a small concierge desk, self-service check-in, and elevators that require a keycard before they take you anywhere (when said keycards prove fickle, it can be a bit annoying)The location is great- a block from Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery- the hotel is very accessible.Amenities- while the lobby is sparse, the rooms feature pretty much everything a business traveler would need- free high speed internet access and flat screen TV. There is free bottled water from a dispenser in the hallway and an adequate breakfast served every morning. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so late night meals need to be delivered or you need to go out.Room- small but comfortable. Enough room to spread out. A desk to work at. No amazing views or luxurious comforts.Overall a great place to stay."
167,1223,"Feb 29 2008 	Great location great hotel	I agree with all the positive stuff already written. Fantastic location, clean, quiet, efficient hotel. We travelled as a family of four and had a good sized family room - king size bed and sofa bed. Bathroom was small and towels were miniscule but apart from that, no complaints. We were cold though, but the staff arrived with a fan heater within five minutes of us calling down to reception. Same when we needed extra towels. Cannot complain, great service!"
168,1223,"Feb 29 2008 	Fantastic location friendly staff wonderful resource	Fantastic location for both business and pleasure literally steps from Trafalgar Square. Incredible value. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Free wi-fi in the room, work room available for wi-fi, workstations or quick informal meeting ... or relax and watch TV. Complementary coffee, tea, and bottled water available. Friendly staff and helpful service, even, for a light-service hotel.Not a high end London hotel but a wonderful resource."
169,1223,"Feb 29 2008 	Perfect Location 	The hotel is in a brilliant location and easy to get to from Gatwick airport thanks to train and underground links. It is 2 min walk to a tube station and seems to be central for everything else. Trafalgar square, picadilly, the mall, covent garden, everything is in easy walking distance. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The self checkout was great, very efficient. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. The views from the rooms are great, although better depending which side your room is on. We were a party of 6 with 3 rooms and they were all great. It was very handy to have free mineral water, and ice on our floor too. Next time I go to London I would stay here, it was great!"

The bed was comfortable and furnished with a feather duvet.Beware that there is no restaurant in the hotel, so if you're getting in late and want room service for dinner, they will order in for you, but it takes around 45 minutes. They do serve a buffet continental breakfast."
171,1223,"Feb 28 2008 	Good value	The Grand isn't all that grand, but it's a good value hotel. The rooms are smallish by American standards, but perfectly adequate and well appointed with internet access and flatscreen tvs.The outlets on the desk were broken."
172,1223,"Feb 27 2008 	I loved swiping the card key	Found a mini suite through londontown.com for a very reasonable price. A part from the long time spent checking in (there was only one receptionist), we enjoyed our stay at Club.i really loved the fact that you had to swipe your card key to access the gym, the library, the tearoom.Our bedroom had a double bed and a sofa bed, a kitchenette with a microwave and a fridge.The bathroom was big enough and very clean. There was a plasma TV which could also be used a PC since the remote was a sort of keyboard. Internet connection was free.On each floor there are vending machines and ice machines as well as drinking water available to be bottled in the free bottles provided.The drawback of this hotel is that there is no restaurant, so you have to go out to get breakfast. Anyway, this is not a major issue since the hotel is within walking distance to Leicester Sq and the Strand."
173,1223,"Feb 25 2008 	Great stay	We stayed one night, it was great as close to Waterloo where our train arrived (15min walk).The check in/out is electronic and was easy. The staff that we met were very helpful.The room was quiet and clean, comfy.A great base for exploring as its very central. Breakfast wasnt included but most guests simply had to walk a few minutes to a well known chain restaurant that had great breakfasts.Would go again."
174,1223,"Feb 21 2008 	Superb location comfortable	The Grand is just off Trafalgar Square and is a superb location for Londons theatres, opera houses and classical music venues, museums and art galleries. Its also close to Westminster and the Eye. The hotel is a recent boutique type conversion of a late 19c grand hotel. The compact rooms are adequately furnished but have limited storage and small bathrooms. The public areas are limited, with the bar and restaurant under construction. The hotel serves a good buffet breakfast and organises take-in room service from a range of local outlets. There is a small gym, excellent free internet access and good laundry/dry cleaning service. The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel is affiliated to Club Quarters, whose members and guests have lower rates and some additional privileges, including access to a lounge. Rating: three star plus now but will be more when completed. Recommended for a short stay but this is not a destination hotel."
175,1223,"Feb 19 2008 	hidden gem in a stunning location at a good price	It's rare to get a hotel in London which is worth writing anything positive about, so I normally abstain...after all - if you don't have anything good to say, then don't say anything at all....So here we are with the Grand. This small, recently renovated hotel is in a simply stunning location 20m of Trafalgar square, 3 mins walk from Charring Cross....yet it is not burdened by being positioned on a major noisy road...In reality it is not a hotel as such, rather an executive club lounge with sleeping accommodation. The reception is small and guests are encouraged to check in using the automatic check in facilities which issue key cards automaticallyingenious if you are in a rush - though staff were about to guide you through the process.The second floor lounge area doubles up as a lounge and breakfast hall. There is a PC work station with complementary internet and a decent laser printer which is useful if you do everything online including Airline check in. None of this key code rubbish or 30 minute internet restriction for a tenner...simply hop on and hop off and Bob's your uncle. Another well thought of idea is the fact you can print directly from your room using the Wifi or LAN connections.The rooms are small  this is after all London! but well appointed and tastefully decoratedno English country garden or Mary Poppins pink toilet covers crap here: just clean, cool creams, browns and greys  it is after all a hotel designed for men. The air conditioning was a bit noisy and the room temp range was 18-25Cbut it did feel kind of chilly with the damp cold winter outside. Plenty of sockets for gadgets. No minibar though....but just next to the lounge are complementary mineral water bottles and ice buckets. Tea/coffee facilities in room with kettle.Decent 26 ish flat screen with a mixture of approx 25 English channels some with subtitling options in foreign languages, 2 phones one on the desk and one DECT cordless and a digital clock radio.The only let down was that there were in-hotel room service facilities as yet, but they provided a delivery service covering most tastes from locally based restaurants minimum order was 20 quid + delivery. Delivery took an hour and was added to the room charge. But lets face it, you don't come to town to stay locked in the hotel all day and night.and there are enough restaurants to cater for most tastes within 5 mins walk...Pizza Express was 3 mins away just in front of the Cx station.Breakfast was also a bit anorexic and would struggle to keep kate moss happy.....and over priced at 20 quid a person, so we just hopped in a cab and went down to the Wolesley on Piccadilly for some hearty brekky for a similar price.Best thing of all was the distinct lack of brats, ok there were a few - but only seen fleetingly and not heard. Keep the kids away and this will remain a hidden gem for distinguished traveller not willing to pay an arm and a leg for London's 5* hit and miss hotels.This hotel is a good example how the big boys should do it....Free internet, free printing, automatic check in, irresistible location, friendly front desk when you needed them and remarkably quiet rooms considering location."
176,1223,"Feb 18 2008 	Excellent Location	Myself &amp; my boyfriend stayed here for a weekend (Fri-Sun). The location was excellent, everything was in walking distance. There was FREE purified water on each floor. Our room was located at the front of the hotel and the noise levels were never disruptive. Check-in &amp; Check-out is hassle free with the express method. Only thing we can't comment on is the food. It's such an ideal location, you're surrounded by bars/cafes so we went out 2 eat on both nights. Would definitley stay here again &amp; recommend it to others."
177,1223,Feb 11 2008 	Great Location	This hotel is in a great location and the staff were pleasant. Aprreciated the free internet and on site free laundry.
178,1223,"Feb 9 2008 	Amazing in every way! Right between Big Ben 	AMAZING MODERN PROPERTY!! PERFECT loation...50 m from Embankment Tube/Thames, 40 m from Trafalgar &amp; RIGHT around the corner from Big Ben/Parliament! Super-High Security with swipe card for access EVERYWHERE! This is a private club for business travelers, usually...but I got lucky! There was a GREAT breakfast buffet daily, on the 2nd floor, for 5 pounds? I think. Huge marble lobby &amp; professional staff... the maid even looked like a super-model! Hehe. Roomy MODERN LED lift. COOL bottled water dispenser/refiller outside my door that was very James Bond-ish.The room... gorgeous &amp; pretty roomy. Beautiful appointments &amp; SUMPTUOUS bed! Big 32&quot; LCD TV &amp; plenty of built-in desk &amp; drawer areas. Corner wardrobe with shelves &amp; room to hang your going-out clothes. Plenty of modern gizmos. Bathroom fairly roomy &amp; ultra-sleek/modern! Double lighted, extending makeup mirrors, and roomy enough shower (no bath) with huge removable shower massager...even a AC/Heating vent BUILT-IN to enclosure! The windows opened up to bustling London, below, with heavy drapes that block the sun nicely. There was plenty of desk space for writing postcards, and nothing lacking. The ENTIRE property is spotless, new, and perfect! NO restaurant, presently, but a TON of EVERYTHING 2 mins walk away. Internet access in the room, as well as FREE webTv. There's also a internet access point &amp; computer on each floor, in the breakfas room/meeting &amp; lounge area on each floor, with a flat-screen there, as well. Oh, and you can print there FROM your room, too!"
179,1223,"Feb 4 2008 	Good (but not great) hotel at best location in London	This is a good (but not great) hotel in an excellent location. The reading room is very special with a great atmostphere (five star hotels please note). The rooms are average, (no mini bar) but adequate. The breakfast was unfortunately disappointing and way overpriced. Staff seemed efficent and friendly. The location crowns it, within seconds of Trafalgar Square and within walking distance of Westminster and Buckingham Palace. I will go back!!"
180,1223,"Jan 30 2008 	Convenient to central London	I stayed in the Club Quarters as it is steps away from my firm's London office. It is a nice clean hotel with comfortable compact rooms. The housekeeping is fine, there is a microwave, coffee/tea maker and a few dishes and cutlery in the room. This made it convenient to prepare some microwave meals from the 24 hour Mini-Tesco on the corner after late meetings. There is a washer and dryer available on the third floor for guest use. I did not use it, but I noticed it when I went to the drinks machine. There is only one but it was not in use the evening I looked at it. Very convenient if you want to rinse out a few things and not use the sink in the room. Filtered water and bottles are available on each floor as are closets with extra room supplies, ironing boards and irons so you can just collect them as you need them and not wait for someone to bring them to you, this is actually quite convenient. There is a lounge with newspapers and coffee on the first floor open to members only. My firm is a member, but I thing that all room keys probably open it. Check in was quite quick and easy as you don't have to wait for a staff member, but simply check in using your credit card in a machine not unlike airport check in kiosks. Check out was as easy. They are building a restaurant, as well as a bar but they are not completed yet. That is not actually a problem as there are plenty of restaurants on The Strand 100 yards away. They do not have room service, but the will shop for groceries at market prices and place them in the in room fridge for 2 service fee. There is also a list of places that will deliver to the room in a binder in the room. The prices on the weekends are quite reasonable for Westminster and non-members are welcome on the weekends. (Frankly they are probably welcome during the week but I have no idea as my firm is a member - as are many other large firms. There is both wired and wireless access in the rooms as well as the common areas. There is a printer that may be used with these connections, however I didn't print anything. One has to go to a central location to relase the job and pick it up (from the hotel's computer - you needn't lug your laptop to the printer). Housekeeping is quite flexible as I requested that they return later in the day as I was having telephone calls to the US east coast during the usual cleaning time.It is close to the Embankment Tube station and Charing Cross train station. Taxi's are ubiquitous at all hours. The streets are not too loud as there are double windows."
181,1223,"Jan 25 2008	Great Location - Need to work on their bookings	The location is unquestionably great - walking distance to the Strand, Trafalgar Square, and Covent Garden. We found a great deal on londontown.com and booked a suite which was to include a kitchen which we wanted since we were staying in London for close to a week. However, when we arrived, we were given a room without a kitchen - the staff said we were downgraded in their system for some reason. We asked to switch rooms and the staff was great and promptly switched us to a room with a kitchen. However, the window in our second room wouldn't close. It was around dinner time and when we called, the staff assured us it would be fixed and we should go out to dinner. We came back after dinner to find the window still stuck open. We called the front desk who sent maintenance to check on it but they couldn't fix the window either. This was around 11pm. We couldn't stay in the room because it was freezing. There was no other room with a kitchen available so we were moved to another room without a kitchen and told we would be moved to a room with a kitchen the next night. So we packed back up to our third room at around midnight.The next morning, we left our stuff packed and the staff told us that they would move us to a room with a kitchen that morning and not to worry about anything. We returned that afternoon to find that we were moved back to the room with the broken window - except the window had not been fixed. Then we were told that all the rooms with kitchens had been booked and there was nothing they could do. We offered to compromise - we would take a room without a kitchen if they lowered our rate accordingly. They said since we booked through Londontown.com, they couldn't adjust our rates. After about an hour or so and a lot of calling around, they &quot;found&quot; a room that they kept on reserve for showings. It was a very nice room with a kitchen. We were told we could stay in that room for at least 2 nights and might have to move again but in the end, we were allowed to stay in it. After we finally moved in, the room was excellent and we didn't really need any other hotel services. The free laundry was excellent. Use of a kitchen was great and what we wanted when we initially booked the hotel. The staff was nice and tried to be helpful but the coordination and logistics in giving us a room we booked and moving us once there was a problem was less than ideal. The hours we spent moving from room to room at the beginning of our stay spoiled the experience a bit."
182,1223,Jan 17 2008 	Excellent placed hotel
183,1223,"Jan 14 2008 	Great location pick your room	RECOMMENDED. One of the best London locations, literally feet from Trafalgar Sq, easy access from Embankment Tube station, hotel is on a relatively quiet street, though rooms facing the street will have street noise. Rooms sizes vary, this is an older restored property. I changed initial room, one facing street had strange bedroom with bath built into room and then enclosed. But bedding &amp; lighting comfortable. I generally stay at St. Paul CQ as think that it is more comfortable (hence I don't give this 5*). But for location this CQ Trafalgar Sq is a super choice."
184,1223,"Jan 10 2008 	Excellent location very good choice	I spent 1 night during business trip in this hotel : very central, very clean, modern rooms (flat screen tv, wood / glass), nice bathrooms. Overall really quiet, and wonderful lobby.Very good choice for a central location and very comfortable rooms."
185,1223,Jan 3 2008 	Great Location
186,1223,"Dec 28 2007 	Great place	This is a fab place to stay in London on a budget. We stepped out early Saturday morning to find Nelson towering only a hundred metres or so away - even if the place itself had been run down that alone would have given it the wow factor for me. But the place is fantastic - as long as you're not expecting a real hotel. We opted to pay a tenner more for a larger room and it was huge, pristine, beautiful fabrics, all the electronics you could want (I didn't want any but they looked impressive), a small dining table/large desk, a kitchenette, a decent bathroom (no bath - but you can't have everything for 85 a night). There was a shopping list in the room - staff will do your food shopping for you for 2 a time - and the prices were just ordinary supermarket prices. We also liked the chilled filtered water and the ice, available down-corridor.The drawbacks... no bar and no restaurant and although we rarely use these when we stay away, somehow the place lost some of its soul in not having them. Reception was very very efficient - wow - and polite though not overly friendly.Would I recommend it...? If you're on a budget and can get a good rate, yes (try Londontown.com). If it's going to cost as much as somewhere like the Rubens then no, go to a place where the welcome and service is exemplary. As we were meeting friends for a Christmas meal in St Martin's Lane it was perfect.And have breakfast in the Strand - we went to a tiny sandwich bar/ cafe place and had full English etc for half the price of the horrible Garfunkels nearby."
187,1223,Dec 16 2007 	Fantastic value for money hotel right in the heart of London!!
188,1223,"Dec 3 2007 	Excellent value for money	All of our usual places had increased their rates substantially so we were lucky to find this hotel. Stayed here over the Thanksgiving break and was impressed at the ease of checking in and out of the hotel. Just swipe your card and you're done. Got a great rate from londontown.com of about 100 pounds/night and well worth it for cleanliness of rooms and location.The room had very comfortable double bed, microwave, air conditioner, and was very clean. No problems with service when the hairdryer broke. Housekeeping showed up almost the moment I put the phone down. Loved the free bottles of water as well!Fantastic location to get anywhere in or out of London (I very easily took Heathrow Express and tube to the hotel). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants nice, clean accommodations but doesn't normally use hotel services like concierge or restaurant."
189,1223,Dec 2 2007 	Great Stay
190,1223,"Nov 27 2007 	Great Location - Very Happy Here!	My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights, November 22 - 26, 2007. When we arrived, shortly after 1:30 p.m. our room, on the 3rd floor was immediately available. I can't say that the front desk was the friendliest I've ever encountered but they were efficient and it took, at most, 3 minutes to get our key cards, take an imprint of our credit card and point us to the elevators (lifts). There were 2 sets of 2 lifts and they all seemed to be working for the entire visit but I did find it strange that one set was hidden around the corner from the check-in desk and not mentioned.Our room was &quot;down the hall and around the corner&quot; and they failed to mention that there were 2 steps, which wasn't a problem excect when rolling the suitcases to and from the room.Great features of this floor include a guest services closet with extra blankets, pillows and irons and ironing boards that could be borrowed. A separate room held laundry machines, an ice maker (!) and a microwave. I was also impressed that the vending machine charged just 60p for a can of Coke, which is half what I've paid in other London hotels. There was also a coffee maker in the vending room but I never used it. Near the elevators was a water purifier with spare bottles and pitchers. This was a very welcome touch.Our room, 331, was huge by the standards of many London hotels. The bed was a queen size (not the double that is standard in many London hotels) and there was a comfy chair that pulled out to a single bed if you needed to sleep a third person. The bed was very comfortable and had crisp white sheets and a big heavy duvet. The pillows were plentiful and comfortable. Each room has individual temperature and fan controls and we were able to make the room a nice temperature once we figured out the c/f conversion.The desk space was very large and well laid out with room to either unpack or live out of your suitcase. There wasn't a proper closet but there was an area with hangers and drawers.The room had a 23&quot; flat panel TV with hook-ups to connect your laptop, video player, or video game system. What a nice touch! The wireless wi-fi worked perfectly and without any complicated log-on protocols. The hotel directory said that it was even possible to print to a printer in the lounge from your room but we never tried this out. The TV didn't have a huge selection of channels (what London hotel does?) but did have the standard channels plus 3 Sky Sports channels, CNN, CNBC and Bloomberg. The hotel is obviously designed for business travelers. There was a clock radio with a CD player and two telephones.A hairdryer was provided as was a make-up mirror, making my wife very happy. The hotel also provided, as a courtesy, an umbrella in every room (5UKP charge if you steal it). There was an electric kettle with tea and instant coffee provided.The bathroom was well laid out and had the best water pressure I have ever experienced in London. The adjustable and variable shower head was very nice. The towels weren't the best but they certainly weren't the worst either. I found them a little rough the bath towel wasn't very large. It may be important to some people to note that this hotel seems to only have rooms with showers and not tubs.Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day and seemed to operate on a later than usual schedule, so we weren't disturbed in the morning with a knock on the door.The hotel has a small fitness room in the basement with a few machines and free weights, which would be enough to keep some sort of routine going if you needed to (and there was a TV to keep you company).The guest lounge on the 2nd floor apparently serves an overpriced continental breakfast (we never had it) and had a TV and one general use computer. If you are a Club Quarters member, you have access to a much nicer lounge with newspapers, comfy chairs and a few more workstations.Sadly, this hotel still does not have a restaurant or bar and I saw no evidence of any haste being made to complete one. Several signs mentioned it was coming soon, but I'll be interested in seeing how long it takes to open. The area is great. The Sherlock Holmes Pub, across the street gets great reviews. The whole area has plenty of places to eat and it is just 2 blocks from Charing Cross Station. There is a 24 hour convenience store a half block away and plenty of fast food and take-away near the station. Charing Cross and Embankment are the two closest Tube stations. A large number of buses pass through Trafalgar Square and it wasn't hard to hail a taxi. The National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery can be seen from this hotel's front door. Covent Garden and Leicester Square are just a short walk.Check-out was quick and efficient but again, not very friendly. Overall, this hotel gained high marks for the location, quality of room and &quot;fit and finish.&quot; It lacks in friendliness of the staff and the dining/drinking options.I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
191,1223,"Nov 25 2007 	good location but very poor service	I stayed here for two nights in November and I must say that the location was very good but the service was the worst I have ever received especially after paying more than 300.00/night. The workers at the hotel don't seem to care at all about their guests! When I arrived at the hotel my room was not even ready, my door to enter my room was left open by the maids, they charge you 1 pound per luggage that they have to keep it in storage for you, and they fail to disclose costs such as breakfast. For the price its not worth it....I recommend people staying at a more reputable hotel organization where you know you will receive proper attention and service. Worst service in Europe by far!"
192,1223,Nov 21 2007	Small rooms but good location	Only stayed for one night as I was in London for business. The room was very small but had a decent tv with internet access. Staff were very nice.Excellent location.
193,1223,Nov 10 2007 	Not worth the $$
194,1223,Nov 7 2007 	Good value for a great location
195,1223,Nov 5 2007 	Nice hotel great location
196,1223,"Oct 24 2007 	Great Weekend Value---Fantastic Location	Fantastic! 2 blocks from the Thames. 1/2 block from the national gallery and Trafalgar square. Clean rooms, comfortable bed, AND FREE LAUNDRY. Yes, FREE LAUNDRY. After a long european trip finishing in London, no better way to spend a rainy afternoon than lounging in a nice hotel room and doing your laundry."
197,1223,"Oct 15 2007 	Great Hotel amazing location	Spent the weekend at this hotel in September '07. It's been recently renovated. The rooms are very nice and the bed was really comfortable.Our room was at the side of the hotel, so we looked out onto the wall next door - not perfect, but this meant that we heard no noise at all, which, for such a central location is amazing.You can't have a better location than this, it is by far the best in London and I used to live there, so know the city quite well. As yet the bar/restaurant is not open, but this is not a problem as there are so many places to eat and drink close by. That said, we went to Garfunkels (a couple of doors down) for breakfast on the first morning and my advice would be to give it a miss. The service was awful, the food average and the toilets horrible! If you cross the road and walk down the alley past the side of Sherlock Holmes pub (also don't eat here) you will come to a street littered with all sorts of places to eat/drink.We will definately be staying here again."
198,1223,"Oct 7 2007 	3rd Class Treatment at 300 Dollars a Night	This hotel is part of a small chain that caters to business travelersin several major city financial and government hotspots. The locationis great, its clean, and nicely decorated. There is limited service, very limited. Part of the hotel's business strategy is to sell memberships to individuals and organizations in exchange for reduced rates. And, the hotel sells rooms to everyday travelers. I found I could not enter the member's lounge, although literature in my room said I had access. The front desk matter of factly told meI wasn't a member and did not have access. At $300 US Dollars a nightbefore taxes this felt less than hospitable or professional. There's a stratification of services and accesses I haven't encountered before."
199,1223,"Oct 7 2007 	The good the bad and the elevator	If you have stayed at a CQ property previously you know that the rooms are very functional and very small. As business traveler on my own this is just great. For families, romantic getaways, etc., not for you.This hotel is in a terrific location, just steps off of Trafalgar Sq. and 2 blocks from Charing Cross RR station and underground. For the price (I booked a few months ago and paid Sterling 97) it can't be beat.However, this place has an elevator problem that needs to be fixed immediately and permanently. I checked in on Sept 29th at about 2pm and was told that 1 (of 2) &quot;lifts&quot; was down but that repair was on its way. After a long wait, I had to squeeze in with several other guests and their luggage in order to get to my room. I went out later in the afternoon and when I came back at about 5pm, both lifts were down. I walked up 8 flights and that was fine for me, these things can happen. But for an older guest, this could be more than a minor inconvenience.When I came back from dinner, all was right - both lifts were working. That would be the end of the story until...I checked back in today, a week later, and 1 of 2 elevators was down again. Again long waits to get to the upper floors. If management can fix this problem, you should stay here as this place has several great attributes. If not, stay away."
200,1223,"Oct 4 2007 	Great Location - Good Hotel	Stay - 4 nights / 4 days.Location - Located just off Trafalgar Square and halfway between Charring Cross Station and Embankment Underground, it was perfect.Room - OK size for London, enough room for our bags, desk to work at and the bathroom was fine, also very clean. We had a room on the 9th floor so views were good - London Eye, Big Ben, etc. Other services they provide for free that we used were chilled water and water bottles (on every floor near the lifts) that you could help yourself to and on the 3rd floor was a laundry room (washer and dryer) that we made good use of.Food  Breakfast only, only had it one day - very basic - better to go up to the Strand and chose from any number of cafes.Staff - Quite good. We arrived about 7:30am and our room wasn't going to be ready till at least 12:30pm but they took in our luggage and let us put our valuables into their safety deposit boxes until our return.Overall - Booked through londontown.com and got a great rate for 3 of the 4 nights and standard rate for the last night (couldn't do any better using any other booking agent either). We would definitely stay here again."
201,1223,Oct 2 2007	Great Hotel In A Prime Location
202,1223,"Sep 25 2007 	Great but only if you get a good rate!	I booked via Londontown.com and paid 279GBP for 2 nights. I asked for a room with a fridge, microwave and a nice view (which you had to crane your neck out of the window to see) - it was very nice .....but I wanted it to be amazing.After paying for a better room and telling the hotel it was a special occasion I thought it was going to be fantastic, but from other reviews I feel let down, there are better rooms than that one (902) it was modern and clean but dark, narrow and with a tiny bathroom! Probably would have been ok for no more than 90GBP per night.My fiance remarked it's a real negative that there's no bar area or couches to relax, and the service is nothing to comment on, just impersonal as is expected.On the positive there are refillable water bottles, ice, ice buckets, pillows, iron and ironing board in cupboards along the corridor which can be accessed free of charge.Also the wireless keyboard in the bedside cabinet allows free internet access on the tv - great for checking tube times etc - just have plenty of patience.TIPS: when you check out you can leave your luggage at the hotel for 1GBP per bag - allowing you to see the sights before your train/flight.Buy an Oyster Card for the tube if you are making more than 3 journeys it will save you loads!"
203,1223,"Sep 25 2007	OK but not finished	The Grand is in a great location and the furnishings are plush, but be warned that I stayed there in September 2007 and the hotel wasn't finished. There is no bar or restaurant yet and the (expensive) buffet breakfast is served in a small lounge. The rooms are well-equipped but small and mine didn't have much natural light."
204,1223,"Sep 23 2007 	Best value 4 star Hotel in London	My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay and found the Hotel exceptional in every way. We payed a little extra for a deluxe double (around 90) which was worth it as we got a larger room with sofa, queen size bed and a kitchenette. The kitchenette which includes a fridge was really useful to make rolls and keep drinks in.The Hotel has recently been refurbished so everything is new and clean. Great location, immediately adjacent to Trafalgar Sq and 5 minutes walk to the west end.Now for the negative - guests are not allowed to use the lounge, which is reserved for members. Also, breakfast costs 9. Don't bother as there is a Garfunkles at the end of the street and a Tesco Metro so you can get supplies there. The tv loses reception and flickers sometimes, but you hardly notice it.Overall, a fantastic hotel that is great value for money."
205,1223,"Sep 21 2007	Very good for the location	I booked this hotel through a website for a special rate of 99GBP with taxes.. it was absolutely worth the money. Excellent central location.. even the stations are very close, although I didnt have to use them. The rooms were neat &amp; modern, facilities like free internet &amp; fitness room are an added bonus. Overall, excellent for business stays. Good staff too."
206,1223,"Sep 16 2007 	Good hotel good location	We stayed at The Grand from 8/24/07-8/26/07. The hotel room was very spacious and the furnishings new. We booked a room with a queen and a sofa bed. The queen had a great mattress. The sofa bed mattress was a bit on the thin side (I could feel some of the springs), but given that we were pretty tired at the end of each day, it didn't matter much. The bathroom is also new and the shower has good water pressure. There is also a really nice gym with new equipment and a very nice lounge (which I assume is where breakfast is served) where they have some very comfy chairs, a t.v. and computer if you need to kill time after checking out. The location is excellent in terms of being able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery are only 5 minutes walk away. We went for runs in St. James Park which was about 8-10 minutes away and could walk the 10-15 minutes to Buckingham Palace. There is also a tube station nearby. I would avoid eating at the nearby restaurants as they seemed a bit over priced since it is a touristy area. What we did find handy was the Tesco Express on the corner. We could buy snacks and drinks and store them in the hotel room's fridge. (The room had a little refrigerator, microwave and sink. They also provided a hair dryer and umbrella.)For the most part, the service from the hotel staff was good. We accidentally zapped the power in our room when we tried to plug something in (oops, and yes, we did use a converter), and they came right away to correct the situation. They took a little longer with the extra towels, but nothing too inconveniencing. (I thought it odd they knew there would be three in the room, set up the sofa bed, but not have 3 towels.) However, on our last day, the street in front of the hotel was closed due to construction, therefore taxis were not driving past the front of the hotel as they usually did. When we asked about taxi service in light of this condition, rather than offering to help us find a taxi, or have someone help us with our luggage (we each had one big suit case as we were travelling for 2 1/2 weeks), the gentleman at the front desk told us to just walk down two blocks to the next main street and hail a taxi from there. I personally thought he could have been a bit more accomodating, and after travelling to three more countries and experiencing service in those other hotels, I definitely know he could have been more helpful. He could have at least tried, I think. Nevertheless, as far as hotels go, it is a good place to stay if you are looking to be in a central location. The rooms are clean and spacious. They also do provide free bottled water which is very helpful. A pretty good deal for the price."
207,1223,Sep 16 2007 	Great hotel with a great location
208,1223,"Sep 13 2007 	Brilliant Place to Stay!	We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the Hotel, every thing you need is available, you could just go to the Locker in the corridor for more Tea/Coffee/Milk if you needed it, Irons &amp; Ironing boards were there too. I needed extra pillows &amp; they weren't in the locker, I rang reception &amp; they were delivered to our room within 10mins. Loved the Iced water available at all times. Look forward to staying there again when there is a Guest Lounge for after Theatre Drinks. We were on the 7th floor at the back, but we had nice views &amp; only very slight traffic noise. The staff are all very friendly &amp; polite. The fact that you don't have to check out until 12noon was wonderful too. Excellent!!!!! Thank you."
209,1223,"Sep 12 2007 	Great location and room	The hotel is a superb location, just steps from Trafalgar Square. Easy walk to tube (2 stations), Waterloo Station, Charing Cross, many attractions. The room was very large and well appointed by London or NY standards, and the shower was great. They do tend to stick it to you on any extras-- they wanted 60 pounds for early check-in before 2:00 PM and 9.90 for a cold buffet breakfast. There was free bottled water, one computer for guest use (hard to get a turn) and free wireless throughout the hotel. All in all a good choice for tourists or business in London."
210,1223,Sep 10 2007 	Perfect Location	Perfect Location. First visit to London and could not have been more pleased with location of this hotel.
211,1223,"Sep 8 2007 	Best Location in London!	The Club Quarters at Trafalgar Square was the best hotel I've stayed in in London. (I've been many times). This is mainly because of its location just off Trafalgar Square. We were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to visit e.g. Covent Garden Leicster Sq, Oxford St, London Eye etc. The rooms were modern, comfortable and clean although I suspect our room was bigger than average due to it being on an awkward corner. The staff were pleasant and helpful at all times. We decided that at 9 the breakfast was a bit pricey so went to the local Tesco for sandwiches!All in all definately worth a visit!"
212,1223,"Sep 4 2007 	great location	Would definitely stay at this hotel again it is new, clean &amp; modern and situated in a great location for sight seeing, theatre's &amp; shopping. All mod cons Flat screen tv, queen bed, nice shower, there is no bar at present but plenty around the area and you do have slight traffic noise but I would imagine most places in London would be the same. Great weekend."
213,1223,"Sep 3 2007 	Fabulous Location	Located just off Trafalgar Square, this hotel is so central, with tube station very close or an easy walk into Leicester Square etc for a good night out.The lobby is very grand and the rooms are really nice. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
214,1223,"Aug 17 2007 	Great location	Very good location. Clean rooms. Good size. Bathrooms are small. They don't advertise it but a washer and dryer (machines are free to use but soap is 1 pound per wash) are available in case you are planning a longer stay.Get a room with a microwave and refrigerator. Very useful again for longer stays.Had a water outage one morning caused by the city water supply. However, hotel did not handle the repercussions well. No water at all for 3 hours in the morning and I had to have the front desk call the manager at home (it was Sunday) to get the OK to have them let me shower at a sister hotel a few miles away. Luckily water supply was restored before I had to make the trip.Restaurant was still being constructed while we were there. Lobby is small but functional.Wireless internet was free along with water bottles everyday. Good connection and speed for the internet.Great value in the heart of central London."
215,1223,"Aug 5 2007 	Great Location	We have just returned from our stay at Club Quarters, Trafalgar Square, having got what we thought was a bargin 173.00for 2 adults for 2 nights (although our hotel receipt did say it was only 56.75 per room per night but still cheaper than the travelodge) first impressions, the hotel is very 'Grand' our view of big ben and the london eye was fab!All attractions just a short stroll away.The only downside we encountered was there wasnt any water at all on Sunday! so a lot of smelly people in London that day! I was glad we hadnt drank all of our bottled water and was able to boil the kettel to have a quick wash.On the whole a great hotel rooms compact but big enough to suit a long weekend, fantastic location and great value."
216,1223,"Aug 3 2007	Great location but overpriced	The hotel location was great; it was close to all major London attractions. The hotel was very expensive. The front desk customer service was very poor. They could not provide any help with booking theatre tickets or restaurant reservations. For the price we paid, the overall experience was very disappointing."
217,1223,"Aug 1 2007	Lovely Stay	I stayed here on two separate occasions while traveling between London and Italy and had a marvelous time both stays, helped in part by the ease with which the staff took control of my luggage between stays. The first room I stayed in was a bit bigger and nicer than the second, but both exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and cleanliness. The hotel's quite new, so everything is in beautiful working order (except the wireless internet which seemed not to reach my room for a few days during my second stay and then magically resolved itself.) The front desk people were helpful, but a bit bland -- this is not a hotel where you'll get a rousing greeting upon your arrival and a fond farewell upon your departure. What you get is competence, which is quite enough for me. (For example, I left behind a nice stainless steel water bottle in the fridge, called and asked if someone had found it and, when I returned for my second stay, it was waiting for me in the fridge of my new room.) The Grand is so comfortable, and so conveniently located (very close to every theater you could want to visit, and a really nice walk to the South Bank), that the slight stiffness at the front desk is not a problem. I will certainly stay here again. And again."
218,1223,"Jul 28 2007 	Be careful about your room rate	When I checked in, I was quoted a room rate significantly above the web rate. When I produced the confirmation e-mail, the original rate was honoured, but as I checked out other guests were querying their rates - so it wasn't an isolated problem.Good room, if perhaps a bit small for two and some obvious fittings missing - fridge, safe. Good walk-in power shower - at least by UK standards.Hotel amenities are a bit basic - although the fitness room is good. I passed on the 9 continental breakfast - there are some great cafs nearby.One concern - while I was there there was a power cut, and the staff didn't sem able to cope. Obviously staff are kept to minimum to keep overheads low, but I wonder how they would cope in a real emergency.That said, if you can get a rate around  100 it's good value in a central location."
219,1223,"Jul 27 2007	Great Hotel - Great Value - Great Location	I have been to London many times and I am happy I discovered The Grand. The room was very comfortable housing my wife and daughter. The kitchenette was convenient and allowed us to enjoy a couple of homemade breakfasts in our room. The location is smack dab in the centre of London close to all tourist attractions and 3 tube stations (Charring Cross, Embankment and 10 minutes from Westminster). Big Ben, Covent Gardens, Theatre District, The London Eye, The National Gallery are all minutes (walking) from this hotel. The staff was very helpful and very pleasant. The free laundromat on the 3rd floor was great as it allowed us to wash our laundry in the comfort of the hotel. I understand this hotel is 6 months old and has the feel of old English charm with all the amenities of a modern hotel. Our cabby mentioned that the hotel used to be an old Ministry of Defense building and the foyer has been completely restored. There are many restaurants and English pubs in the surrounding area. Hats off to Club Quarters for doing a great job restoring this hotel. We'll be back!"
220,1223,"Jul 25 2007	Great stay in London!	My husband and I loved this hotel. The location was perfect for getting around London. We could walk practically everywhere: the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus -- not to mention that we could see Trafalgar Square from our room. Anything out of the way was just an underground or bus ride away (like Notting HIll), and the bus passes just in front of the hotel. That said, the hotel was pretty quiet, the staff was efficient (not warm though). We loved that there was a laundry room we could use if we needed and that the hotel provided us with an environmentally-concerned alternative to buying bottled water. Skip breakfast at the hotel though and get it at a nearby restaurant. We loved going to the restaurants on St. Mark's just a five minute walk away. When we booked this hotel, we paid a bit more than some other options, but we loved every minute of our stay at the Grand and don't regret a thing!"
221,1223,"Jul 24 2007 	Great hotel great location	This hotel is in an absolutely great location - practically right on Trafalgar Square, close to Big Ben, House of Parliament, a 10-15 minute walk to Buckingham Palace, very close to the Theater District and Piccadilly Circus. Also, only one block to the footbridge to the South Bank.The rooms were larger than I expected (after staying three days in a smaller hotel in Paris), were updated and very tastefully decorated. They were very comfortable and were quiet. We were able to control the temperature in the room with a very easy to use digital thermostat. The bathroom wasalso a nice size, although the shower curtain allowed water to escape the shower and puddle on the bathroom floor. One very nice amenity was that there were bottles available to fill with cold purified water and take with us as we went about our site seeing. The staff was very professional and pleasant. I'm not sure this is the place if you have kids (no pool or other such entertainment), but it was perfect for adults. Apparently, the hotel was recent renovated (about 7 months ago) and the restaurant was not open while we were there. No big loss, though, as the hotel was close to several pubs and other restaurants."
222,1223,"Jul 24 2007 	Really pleased with our choice	We stayed here for 2 nights - 6 &amp; 7 July 2007, we were coming to London to see the Tour de France and choose this hotel because of its location being close to Trafalgar Square, Whitehall, The Mall etc and were not disappointed when we found it. The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Charing Cross station and 2 minutes from Trafalgar Square. We were really pleased with the hotel, having booked through the LondonTown website at a discounted price, we paid 220 in total for a 'Superior' room with a kitchenette, the room was large and very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was nice and clean and the shower was good. I'm not sure what the full price should be and maybe you could find a cheaper place but we had no complaints whatsoever. There was no breakfast included but we just called into a coffee shop down the road and stocked up with provisions at the Tesco Extra just on the corner before going on our wanders. We would definitely stay here again next time we go to London."
223,1223,"Jul 23 2007 	Excellent value and what a location!	Given how last-minute we booked the hotel, we never expected to get anything half as nice for 84! The hotel is new (some facilities 'coming soon') and clearly oriented to guests of 'member clubs' - but neither thing should put you off. The location, 1 minute on foot from Trafalgar Square, is hard to beat, especially if your reason for being in town is the West End or South Bank theatres, clubs, etc.The room we had was a standard, but better (and less dull) than most chain hotels costing more than we paid. Excellent shower, comfy bed, nice furnishings. No mini-bar though, and the TV system seems too clever for its own good and occasionally cut out for no reason.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. There is chilled filtered water, and ice, on each level, which is a good idea and I don't know why more places don't do the water too.Would definitely recommend, especially given the bargain price!"
224,1223,"Jul 15 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	We stayed here 13 July and enjoyed our stay. We booked a deluxe room which had kitchenette facilities. Room is larger than average in central London , was very clean, had aircon. bathroom is small but adequate. Location is great - we could see Nelson from our room and it is literally a minute to Trafalgar Square and 5 minutes walk to Leicester Square. We got a good rate of 110 through Londontown but expect prices will rise once all the facilities are available. Nice hotel of good standard."
225,1223,"Jul 9 2007 	Great value	Great value in the heart of London. Rooms are good and the hotel is very quiet even though Trafalgar Square is on the doorstep. Don't be put off by the lack of restaurant facilities. Who eats in their hotel anyway when there are so many restaurants in London to choose from? Front desk staff are efficient and very courteous. Whether or not they will increase their prices when the hotel renovation is complete remains to be seen but for now it represents great value for a hotel in central London. By the way, the renovation work does not affect the rest of the hotel in any way. You would not know that work was going on. Book with confidence."
226,1223,"Jun 16 2007 	Smart hotel and top notch location	I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone planing a short stay in central london. It's near to almost all of the touristy things, no more than two tube stops, if not within walking distance.The room was really pleasant too. It was smart, modern and very clean. The room didn't have a bath but this meant that the shower space was bigger so the shower curtain didn't stick to you so much.Good times = )"
227,1223,"Jun 14 2007 	Great location new hotel	We stayed here one night after flying in from Australia. We were ableto check in early at a fee of 30 Pounds. The room is smallish, but very comfortable. The bathroom is quite adequate.The location was good, 3 minute walk to Trafalgar Square, and the tube station. A short 10 minute walk down to the River Thames, where there are some nice restaurants on river boats.Agree with previous comments about check in and check out, they need more staff, although once explained the automated check in/out is easy to do.Each floor has an area where to get extra supplies eg soap, shampoo etc, not like a hotel where someone would bring these to you.Also if you book cheaply ie via the internet you DO NOT get access to the Club Lounge, which is quite nice. Instead you get access to the lounge on the second floor, one computer and a very ordinary coffee machine.I would stay here again, I felt is was good value, and the bed was comfortable."
228,1223,"Jun 13 2007 	The Grand	We recently stayed at the Grand at Trafalgar Square (listed here as &quot;Club Quarters,&quot; the chain who own the hotel). We were happy with our choice, for reasons described below: We needed was a hotel close to a Tube station since one of us had business elsewhere in the City and the other wanted to sightsee on foot. The Grand it as centrally located as it could be, and it is only some 2.5 blocks from Embankment Station. We could see Big Ben out a window adjacent to the lift, we had an easy walk to St. James Park (at the end of which stands Buckingham Palace) and to Westminster Abbey, and on a sunny day we walked across the bridge to the London Eye and (further up) the Globe and the Tate Modern. If your goal is to make quick visits to Picadilly, Covent Garden, the British Museum and such, and to return (late) to a location that never lacks for activity, this hotel is a good choice. If you want something cozy or funky, or homey (like a B&amp;B), or of you want to be close to the London club scene or less expensive restaurants, this is not your hotel. The Grand is very corporate in feel. Dependable, I suspect, and a good bet for a first trip. I'd stay there again, unless my goal was to explore for something more clever. That has to do with my own interests, not any failings at The Grand.The hotel itself was clean and recently refurbished. The room was better appointed and far more spacious than I expected -- though we often stay in NYC hotels, which modifies an American's expansive hotel expectations. Still, I didn't expect as much as we got. We'd heard such horror stories about &quot;London hotels&quot; that I anticipated paying $300 for a closet with outdated furnishings. Neither of these fears proved true. The room rather reminded me of a small &quot;executive&quot; room in Midtown. Bathroom was modern, adequate, clean. Similar to the better bathrooms I've encountered in European hotels -- i.e., economical use of space, no fluff.Service not very chipper -- sort of, &quot;You want us to do what?&quot; -- but once we clarified, they did everything we asked, by the book. It took some doing, but we did eventually convince them to send up the cereal, milk and yogurt they listed on the in-room price list. (Who can eat English breakfast five days in a row? You'll die of a coronary.)"
229,1223,"Jun 12 2007 	Ab Fab	We stayed in the Club Quarters Trafalgar Square in May. It was a lovely hotel with excellent staff and in a great location. The hotel has no facilities yet for getting breakfast or dinner but as it is London there are lots of options on your doorstep. The room was clean and serviced daily and there was water and ice on every floor which meant we had drinking water at all times they even provided the bottles to take away, which in London is very rare.There was attention to detail and the hotel would be excellent for business or pleasure.The location of the hotel meant we wasted no time or money stuck in the notorious London transport system as everything we wished to see was within walking distance.The hotel is well worth a visit!"
230,1223,Jun 5 2007 	Hotel and breakfast	Great stay this last weekend. Refurb seems good. Room a little small but location was fantastic and price was good as well. Didn't have breakfast at hotel but sat in Trafalgar Square with Croissant and coffee from coffee bar at right top side of Trafalgar Square -- near perfect early summers day -- unbeatable.
231,1223,"Jun 5 2007 	Mediocre and unhygienic	The Club Quarters looked brilliant but it was not.I arrived at reception. One person was working and five guests were waiting but there were automated check-in booths. Three of us tried to use a booth but it refused to accept any credit cards. We all joined the long queue and checked in at the desk where the receptionist told us that she knew the card reader on that machine was not working -- she had been standing a metre from us as we all fumbled with it! A quick sample of other check-in conversation, (to the man in front of me), &quot;don't worry: the walls at the one at St Pauls are like paper but these are a bit quieter&quot; or (on being asked if the room was far from the lift), &quot;I don't know, the computer assigns them at random&quot; You have the flavourThe room itself looked nice -- lots of browns and greens but well done with decent space. I'd booked an executive with kitchenette (a microwave and a non-functioning refrigerator). But it is obvious where they save the money. The beds are cheap and the linen is worse. The duvet covers are not changed between guests I guessed (from the stains on the quilted material) and confirmed this with reception -- a revolting practice which may be acceptable in America but clearly provokes a lot of complaints here as the receptionist wearily told me that no, there were no cotton duvet covers. New York recently had an outbreak of bed bugs in hotel rooms -- I thought I would rather be cold and uninfested, so slept under just a sheet (which did seem clean). The bed was hard but not in a supportive way.I was cold because, whatever temperature you enter into the system, the air conditioning pumps out cold air. I turned it off and put on an extra t-shirt. The rooms are quite noisy as the renovation is flimsy and noise from the hallways can be heard starting earlyAt 9am, housekeeping tried to come into my room. At 9.30, they started drilling in the wall of the adjoining room, next to my bed.This place is designed for junior employees visiting a London office, often on contracts, who have low hotel travel budgets. The club lounge (with fake panelling and work stations) is probably useful for them. The lack of staff, indifference to guests, low level of facilities, unhygienic bedding and noise make it unsuitable for anyone with serious work to do the next day.Cheap but not good value. If you really need to pay this little, a Travel Inn costs less and the duvet covers are clean or the Citadines across the street, whilst still lacking luxury, has an adequate level of staffing"
232,1223,"Jun 4 2007 	Great location.	Spent ages trying to find a reasonable priced hotel in a good location in London and eventually came up with this. Paid just under 100 a night for a double room, room was very clean and a reasonable size for London. We found the staff friendly and helpfull though we didn't have any problems for them to deal with.As remarked before it is in a great location about 100 Metres from Nelsons column, it has been refurbished in the last year so everything is clean and working. There are free ice and filtered water dispensers on each floor and also an iron and ironing board for the sort of people who feel the need to iron in a hotel.On the downside there is only two lifts that meant using the stairs was sometimes worth doing if you can't be bothered to wait around and are happy to keep fit.Also though there were a good selection of TV channels including spy Sports 1-3, the picture kept fractulating which became annoying after a while, but them I wasn't there to watch TV.The lack of food facilities at the moment isn't really an issue as there are loads of places to eat within a few hundred metres. I recommend the Thai Square restaurant.There is also a Teso extra on the corner of the road to get anything you need."
233,1223,"Jun 2 2007 	Perfect location	I do some work for an institution that is a member of Club Quarters. It was the first time I stayed at one of their properties and I can not complain. The location is so good that I give the hotel an Excellent rating overall, although I have stayed at more elaborate hotels. Also the room rate was about 200 and I was quite pleased that didn't come out of my own pocket.The hotel is located in a grand old building, I suppose that is way it is also called &quot;The Grand&quot;. The rooms are quite modern, though. The air conditioning is excellent and the rooms are of good size. I had only a shower in my room and there was nothing to put on the bathroom floor. As a specialty, there were some books to read in my room. There was no minibar.The breakfast was ok and inexpensive (I think 4). Internet was free. There is no restaurant or bar yet so the breakfast was served in a lounge. There was a feeling of safety in the hotel as the clients are mostly from member organizations. The hotel should have a gym but I didn't try that out."
234,1223,"May 30 2007 	Very good for families -highly recommend	We just returned from a 2 night stay over the May Bank Holiday weekend and were very happy with our experience. We lived in London for several years but had never quite cracked it in terms of finding a place to stay when coming back as tourists with 2 young children. Now I think we have. The location is fabulous, a half block from Trafalgar Square and across the Millenium Bridge from the South Bank and London Eye. The renovation of the hotel seems to be complete. We had a lovely room which, although billed as a one bedroom suite ,was actually just a very large single room with a comfortable king size bed and a large sofa bed which fit our 2 children. I had read a review indicating that you had to be careful to make sure that they gave you a big enough room for a family of four so I called the hotel reservations centre a few days before we arrived to confirm that the room would be big enough. If you need a family room, I would advise doing the same. We also had a kitchenette which consisted of a microwave, refrigerator (new, with the plastic wrapping still on the inside) and a sink. The hotel provides a complete set of dishes and silverware and pots and pans. We found this invaluable for bringing food back from the nearby Marks and Spencer Simply Food and heating it up ourselves. When you travel with small children you really need to have kitchen facilities. The room was quite spacious, even with the king size bed and sofa bed. The bathroom was a separate room, no bath, only shower but quite large and obviously new. Our rate did not include breakfast but with the kitchenette, it was quite easy to have our own breakfast in the room, and much more convenient with kids too. I had read the reviews indicating that the staff was unfriendly but we found everyone very helpful and any requests for service (ie to fix a light or bring up additional plates) was dealt with quickly. Also liked the fact that there was good security, key card needed in the elevator and the fact that they called to the room to confirm that they could give out a key to my husband who arrived after we did. The price was the same that we had paid for smaller rooms much less centrally located. We did request a room in the back of the hotel, off the street. It had no view but it was quiet and we weren't in the room long enough to have a view really matter. The location of the hotel leads me to doubt that there would really be any special view (ie it does not front onto Trafalgar Square but rather a road off the Square with only a view of the street, so who really cares?). All in all, a great place for families and others too. I would definitely stay here again."
235,1223,"May 21 2007 	Perfectly locatedrecently refurbished	This hotel is perfectly located just off Trafalgar Square. It's as grand inside as it is on the outside. It had very recently been refurbished and we could still smell the paint! (but not a put-off whatsoever). I booked through booking.com, and thought it was excellent value. Our room was spacious, light and airy, with a lovely big bed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, with its convenient location and perfect rooms, you can't go wrong."
236,1223,"May 20 2007 	The good the bad and the confusing	We stayed at The Grand at Trafalgar Square (also known as Club Quarters) in mid-April, 2007, for about a week. For the price and location it cant be beat. The central London location is the best thing about this hotel. The rooms were spacious, with tall ceilings. The bathroom and closet were obviously added into the rooms with the remodel. They didnt reach to the high ceiling, and the bathroom would get pretty steamy, with no fan. There were a total of 4 elevators, and they were pretty modern, but you had to use your key card to get to the other floors. We found it easier just to take the stairs most of the time.They have a free laundry (one washer, one dryer), on the 3rd floor. The instructions on the machine were strange though, since they didnt have the standard washing cycles. The timer seemed to be off, too, since I came back to the machine before it was to have finished, only to find someone had already removed by laundry and put it in the dryer. Whatever.The LCD TVs are nice, but the satellite signal was troublesome. The channels we watched would freeze the picture every 20 seconds or so, making it difficult to watch for any length of time.Each floor had a chilled purified water dispenser, with little plastic bottles to fill. The caps arent watertight, so dont plan on putting the bottles anywhere where they might tip over.There was a guest supply closet on each floor, with extra towels, toilet paper, etc., but they were always mostly empty when we needed supplies. Oh well.Other good stuff: Washcloths are included! There is free wireless internet. Its really close to multiple tube/rail stations. The queen beds were a good size, and they had books about London in the room, as well as in the sitting areas on other floor. Other bad stuff: Housekeeping didnt always give us toilet paper or towels, the toilets have to be flushed many, many times. Even a Kleenex sometimes wouldnt flush until after a few tries. Go figure. The front desk was usually pretty slow to respond to requests  in the evenings they seem to have minimal staff. Although we did get a quick response once out of about four calls.The continental breakfast is very expensive, but OK (croissants, granola, cereal, fruit, and salami and cheese). A lot of the restaurants nearby arent open before 10am, so good luck finding another breakfast place.They were doing construction on the street at night, so occasionally there would be this rhythmic booming sound, but it was somewhat distant, and not too difficult to ignore.And the stuff we couldnt figure out: There was a weird knob on the lightswitch that didnt seem to control anything, and there were no do not disturb placards to hang on the doorknob. I dont know if this is a british thing, but its the first time Ive stayed in a hotel that didnt have any."
237,1223,"May 14 2007 	A pleasant surprise!	I stayed here for one night whilst in town for a business do. I was really pleasantly surprised! My room was really big and with the rate from Expedia, this place offered a really good value for money. As this is a newly refurbished hotel (still being done up), the decor was brand new and everything worked perfectly. There was a large desk in the room, kitchen corner, big wardrobe and a sofa. The TV was a brand new flat screen one. In terms of style, not a designer or boutique hotel, definitely more like a Hilton or Starwood... The staff were fine, didn't experience any problems at all. I couldn't get a taxi so they got the hotel car to take me out. This was a good service too; a big private car with a chauffeur! I really enjoyed my stay. There were no bar/restaurant facilities which was a shame. These are still to come and I think everything should be up and running soon. I can recommend this place for sure and will check it out again if I need a hotel in London. I would stay again!"
238,1223,"May 6 2007 	Wonderful Hotel!!! Would Highly Recommend	First time visit to London and could not have been happier with this hotel! The location was to die for. A few steps down the street and you were right in Trafalgar Square. This hotel is right in the heart of Westminister and we were able to walk to the Thames river, Buckingham Palace, Theatre District, National Gallery, Picadilly Circus and London Eye. There are two underground stations nearby (Charring Cross and Embankment). We actually found that the Embankment station was the closest to the hotel. Walking down Northumberland Ave. (away from Trafagar Square) near the Embankment station are two boats that have been turned into restaurants/bars, where you can sit out on the deck and overlook the London Eye and Big Ben and sip a glass of wine or champagne. Very nice!Besides a great location, the room was top notch. Modern decor, nice linens, flat screen t.v., shower only in bathroom (but we didn't mind), and free internet access. Front desk staff was friendly, check-in was a breeze (they now have touch screen monitors for easy check-in), serve-yourself purified water and supply cabinets (with extra pillows, shower gel, etc.) on each floor. I would highly recommend this hotel to fellow travelers!"
239,1223,"Apr 17 2007 	Nice Hotel Great Location	This is a lovely hotel, nice old building and big rooms but can be noisy if you are over looking the road (Northumbeland Avenue) as it is right opposite the bus stop but just request inside room or take earplugs!. This is a 1 minute walk from Trafalgar Square and about 10 mins to Covent Garden. 2 mins from nearest tube which is embankment. We were going to Phantom at the theatre and it is a 5 min walk. Double room was very spacious (think disabled facilities) and very clean and modern. Reception very polite and you can leave your luggage for 1. Would stay again."
240,1223,"Apr 9 2007 	Will Be Better When Fully Finished	We stayed at this hotel during Easter. The Location is great about 1 minute walk to trafalger square. The nearest tube station is Charing cross which is about a five minute walk.This is a very modern hotel and i would think that this will become a very popular hotel over the next few months. the rooms were very nice with all the amenities you need. Eg television, tea and coffee, shower and king size bed. There was no bath in our room only a shower but that didnt bother us.Wasnt much information in the rooms about the hotel only an a4 sheet of paper telling you when other things will be open.There is no bar or resturant at the moment and these are due to open in August.If you will be staying there soon then garfunkles is next door and there is a pub just opposite.The cleaner didnt try to clean our room until about three in the afternoon which was too late for us as we was getting ready to go out for the night then.All in all its not a bad hotel. i would imagine that when this new hotel is fully open it will be alot better so we will be waiting until its fully open before we visit again."

1,1226,Nov 16 2009 	Very disappointing	I found this through trip advisor and thought it looked like an interesting modestly priced alternative to the other London hotels. I was very disappointed. It is located in a side street opposite a block of flats. Its style is retro - if retro means bare wooden floors and tables. There are lots of pubs in the area with lovely Victorian glass etc - this is the opposite. Our room was modest but at the top of two flights of narrow stairs up which i had to carry a 25kg case! The shower was almost impossible to adjust properly and the shower stall was minute. Officially the worst of many awful showers on this trip.It advertises itself as a gastro pub and we had breakfast 2 mornings - most of the food was from a packet. The toast was white bread with no option. Everything arrived at once and the coffee was lousy. Still it was cheap and the girl who booked us in was friendly.
2,1226,"Aug 18 2009 	Wanna keep the Harrison a secret but others deserve the pleasure too!!!	First, the hotel is so good it should get more business, but I don't want it all booked next time I'm in London. I stayed at the Harrison two nights on my way in and one on the way out of Britain, mid-July and early August. I was there with my wife, and some friends going to the same event stayed there too. The hotel, third floor, four rooms, with a pub on the ground floor, is run by the owner, who had no trouble with our arriving early and quite late respectively on both bookings. The staff, which is minimum, and himself, are very helpful and friendly. They will also tip you on London stuff if asked. When our friends had some trouble to leave on time for Heathrow, the owner was ready to help them with all the arrangements neededBreakfast is enormous, filling and delicious, it kept me going for the rest of the day. We had the veggie option. A banquet. And you can order it to your room at no extra cost.The rooms are very spacious compared to similar places, clean, not hospital-clean, but in really good shape, the beds are great and the bathrooms are small but not at all tiny. There is a TV with a DVD player, and a small number of movies available if you want to see them. You can make tea or coffee in your room.Location: It's a short walk from Kings Cross, in a completely residential neighborhood, really quiet, I even got to see a red fox on the lawn in front. It is a healthy walk, maybe 20 minutes, to the British Museum (if you are a commited walker).In all, I should compare the Harrison with other places I've stayed at in London. In common with others, steep stairs, small bathroom. Everything else is better. Best toilet paper ever, toiletries are excellent, Neutrogena, not the detergent like stuff I've seen elsewhere. The rooms are, again, really big for London standards. And it has a cozy, homely air that helps you rest better. Bedsheets, towels perfectly clean. Mmh, you can tell I loved it."
3,1226,"May 6 2009 	Lovely pub with rooms close to Bloomsbury.	Stayed here recently and found it a pleasure -- lovely staff, very pleasant, clean and simple accomodation with a fab breakfast served in your room if you want it. The pub itself is in a quiet residential street about five minutes walk from King's Cross/St Pancras or 10-15 minutes from Russell Square tube. The rooms are two flights up above the pub itself. Not the place if you are disabled or have dificulty with your mobility, but otherwise great. The room was very simply but beautifully furnished and larger than I expected. Wifi access was free and easy to access throughout the building. Staff were really friendly and helpful and the breakfast which is included in the price was good. There was quite a lot of noise from the downstairs pub in the evenings, but it quieted down after 11pm and it didn't bother me, but might make it trickty for people with small children. Overall good value for the area -- you'd pay at least as much if not more for accomodation in a hotel which was nowhere near as good. Recommended for short stays or weekend breaks."
4,1226,"Mar 24 2009 	Great Breakfast warm welcome and very pleasant stay	We stayed for one night on a Saturday and were very pleased. The room was small but clean and modern, bathroom nice and clean, and best of all a huge breakfast was included in with the price which, if you wanted, you could have in your room.Located 10 mins from St Pancras and 5 mins from Russel Square tube we found it an ideal base for a weekend in London. The rooms are above a pub in a residential area so we were a little concerned about noise but we had no problems. The pub is actually only open for private parties on Saturday nights and by the time we returned at 12.30 it was shut up, and noone is aloud outside with drinks after 10pm so they are very considerate landlords.We had a warm welcome, our bags were looked stored after we checked out until we returned to collect them and we had a great Sunday roast (served until 7pm on Sundays). We will return!"
5,1226,"Mar 12 2009 	A Hidden Gem	I found the Harrison through Late Rooms.com and took a chance as i was on a budget and i could not have been more impressed. They advertise themselves as 'A Hidden Gem' and it is exactly that.The staff were welcoming and friendly, our room felt like home from home and the breakfast was just the icing on the cake!for 50 bed &amp; breakfast per room you cannot go wrong!"
6,1226,Sep 27 2009 	Muy buen hotel y bien situado
1,1228,Feb 19 2006	Service is an oxymoron	Stayed at the hotel with my wife in January. Would definitely not recommend. Some of the worst service I have ever seen in a hotel. My wife had booked a room after having gone to the hotel 10 days earlier while she was in London. She had spent an hour looking at the rooms and then reserved it on her AMEX card. The hotel then cofirmed the reservation with me personally on the phone 3 days prior to our arrival. They promptly gave away the room and gave us the smallest room in the hotel saying that they had needed it. The manager lacked any grace and does not understand what service means. They had not the slightest sense of compunction. I personally do not know how it can survive.
2,1228,"Oct 25 2005	Friendly stylish cosy and reasonable	I love this hotel! For half the price of an anonymous, impersonal and mass-produced chain, it offers charm and comfort in a greta location - close to Hampstead, Belsize Park and well connected to central London by tube in 10 minutes.The food is excellent (french-inspired and ample) and the service smooth. Just don't expect the mass-produced slickness check-in and scripted service routines at dinner - take your time, relax and chat - you'll find it welcoming and refreshing.The standard rooms are minimalist, Scandinavian style rooms in the basement. the executive rooms are cosier and more opulent, on the upper floors.Try calling them direct for better rates - it can beat the prices offered elsewhere."
3,1228,"Sep 19 2005	Don't you dare ask for a Sandwich	If youre after a hotel that takes you back to 1970s levels of English unionised service  the House Hotel in Hampstead is it. Youll find the check in process slow and cumbersome, hampered by computers that hardly work. The rooms are at best adequate and the room service  well its non-existent. A request for a simple sandwich at midnight will be met by blank refusal and the advice that if you want any food theres a newsagent some way down the road !! For a mid-priced London Hotel in 2005  my advice is to seek accommodation elsewhere."
4,1228,"Aug 28 2005	Shockingly bad service	Based largely on other reviews on this site, I booked one night at the House Hotel in Hampstead. When I arrived, the person at check-in ignored me in favor of the news he was watching, never even saying hello once he grudingly got up, walked over and threw the check-in form at me. Adding to his charm, he also smelled as if he hadn't showered in four days. When I asked to confirm that the room I had booked at a higher rate was not facing the street (this on the advice of the booking person on the phone, who suggested that if I needed a good night's sleep, I ought to pay 20 pounds more a night for a room not on the street), he said: &quot;Well, I guess you'll just have to see for yourself. I need your credit card.&quot; When asked what time check-out was in the morning, he said, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I asked for a wake-up call the next morning, which came in 15 minutes late and consisted of a ring and no answer at the other end. The room -- which, unlike the main room, which is charming, was characterless and cheaply furnished -- was also in the basement, heated to approximately 95 degrees, and as I was a woman traveling alone on business I didn't feel comfortable keeping the ground floor window open. It took 90 minutes to cool the room down, using an inefficient air conditioner with a hose that had to be manually put out of the open window. The bed was uncomfortable, the pillows were foam. And the next morning, having slept badly, I arrived 45 minutes before breakfast ended to find that there was no silverware left, several items had run out and were not replaced and only one staff person showed up during 20 minutes. He was asked for a cereal spoon and did not return, until he and a colleague started loudly putting away the remains of breakfast, with 25 minutes to go until closing. At this point, I had given up. I went to check out, which involved 15 minutes and three people, though I had a cab waiting and a meeting to get to. At no point did anyone ask if I had enjoyed my stay. I guess they must know better at this point. I paid nearly $200 for one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had in any city. Don't be fooled by the charming website photos. This place is a dump."
5,1228,"Jul 14 2005	Nice Reasonably Priced Hotel in a Fun Neighborhood	It's not in the central touristy part of London, but Hampstead is a great neighborhood with lots of interesting shops and good restaurants. And the trip into town is a quick one on the tube. We had a room in the main house, which was of reasonable size, well-appointed and clean. There was good water pressure, and a nice continental breakfast. It's a charming little hotel, but on a busy street so ask for a quieter room if you can get it. The only small complaint was the staff. They tried hard to be helpful, but were poorly equipped. Had a hard time recommending restaurants and when they did, they couldn't remember the names, provide directions or give phone numbers. Seems like management could solve that with a book of recommendations and info. Overall, very good for the money. Would definitely stay there again."
6,1228,"Dec 16 2004	Not as impressive as I thought	Stayed for two nights in the House Hotel. It was in a great area, and seemed nice. However, they advertise that there is Moulton Brown in the bathrooms - there isn't! They have it in the public bathroom and they sell it - so that didnt impress me for a start. The room was exceptionally small, but comfortable at the same time and nicely decorated. Also, our CD player didnt work.Continental breakfast was served till 10. At 9:55 they started to clear everything away and made you feel uncomfortable for sipping over your coffee. The breakfast staff were very rude.The decor in the reception area and bar was fabulous, but I wasnt bowled over with the staff, nor the rooms (and the lack of Mouton Brown!)We got a good deal on the room, but if I had paid full price I would have felt ripped off!"
7,1228,"Nov 15 2004	Romantic retreat in London	I stayed in the House Hotel in London's Belsize Park/Hampstead area for 4 nights. The hotel was rennovated and opened under new management a few years ago. Located on a busy street, the hotel offers guests quick access to the lovely shops and delightful restaurants of Hampstead Village, Belsize Park, Camden, and Primrose Hill. It is also a few minutes from the Hampstead Heath, a quiet oasis of nature in busy London that is perfect for a relxing walk or jogging. The House Hotel is also located directly on major bus lines and 2 minutes from the Tube. The hotel is quite small--only 23 rooms--and has a wonderfully intimate feel. The rooms are stunning, each one uniquely decorated with bold use of color, sumptuous fabric wallpapers, luxurious bedding, and interesting artwork. The marble bathrooms are compact, but comfortable with large bathtubs, delightful amenities, and thoughtful touches like a clipping of fresh flowers. Our double room was split-level with a small sitting area in the upper level and then a few steps down into a gorgeous and romantic bedroom with a rich red theme. Each room has cable TV, CD player, mini-bar, and safe. By London standards, the room was generous in size, but still quite cozy. The staff were friendly in spite of being ueber-hip, but because of the hotel's small size, don't expect the range of services offered at larger hotels (lugging your luggage, for instance, is your own problem unless someone happens to be around to help you). We didn't dine in the trendy restaurant, Salon, but heard that it was quite good, albeit expensive. Because the hotel is located on a major street, expect some traffic noise, especially during the warmer months when you may have your windows open. We had some minor service glitches (no sheets on the bed when we arrived, problems with our TV), but staff sorted things out quickly and with good cheer. I often visit family in this neighborhood and would stay in this hotel again."
1,1230,"Oct 15 2009 	Average for London but beds are ridiculous small	First of all it is London we are talking about and everything is super expensive there. Whatever you consider a bargain it will come up with a big price tag.Keeping this in mind the Hyde Park Towers are ok. The location is very good 2 min walk from Baywaters station and entrance to Kensington Park. It is a considerably clean hotel and the part of the hotel the room was located was quiet. The remarks about sub-terrain located rooms are true and defenitely avoid those rooms. The breakfast is really good unfortunately the breakfast room tends to be overcrowded. The biggest downside of the hotel is the bed. Never seen a hotel with a double bed that actually qualifies only as single. On our complain the reception told us all beds in the hotel are of the same size. The rooms are small as well but suficient if you only want to rest, but you will not spend there more than 10 minutes awake and make sure you are not claustrophobic!After all I would only recommend the hotel for tight budgets. Everyone able to spend an extra 50 pounds per night go to one of the branded hotel chains."
2,1230,"Oct 11 2009 	just above no frills	great location, close to tube. rooms small, but your only there to sleep so who cares. Bed was excellent with down duvet and pillows, which is top marks for me cause a good sleep is number one in inportance. A little noisy on steet side rooms, but it settles down when its time to sleep. Morning meals were great, however end at 8.30 am which as a little early for worn out tourists. Staff were freindly. Hotel is getting a little tired, and its close to needing a makeover, but still its O.K. for price and location"
3,1230,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Location Great Value	The location is yards away from the Bayswater Tube station and a short walk from Kensington and Notting Hill. Easy access to restaurants, shopping, and transportation. The hotel appear to be a restoration of several older buildings that now connect. My room, 115, small but very comfortable bed. No iron or ironing board. Full bathtub/shower. TV with 5 or 6 channels. Free internet was great!!!!!"
4,1230,Oct 2 2009 	Centrally located but small room loud subway noise	We stayed here for one night during Wimbeldon. There was not much available. The room was small and the carpets were really worn. There was no air confitioning and the bathroom was a closet. The only plus was the the price was reasonable and the hotel was close to central london on the tube train. The hotel rumbles from the tube each time it goes by. The neighborhood is good and there are lots of restaurants and an internet cafe down the street.
5,1230,"Sep 17 2009 	Basic but adequate	Most of the reviews below are pretty accurate:- Location is great (3-minute walk from Bayswater tube)- Rooms are quite small, but that's London if you want &quot;cheap&quot;- Staff is very helpful (if sometimes ill-informed)- Two nearby tube stations, Queensway high street, Whitely's shopping mall and Hyde Park are easily walkable. The Paddington tube / rail is also only one stop away.- In-hotel bar--open til 12:30 am--is a &quot;nice to have&quot; in this area where there is little open after 11:00pm. Good free nibbles from the restaurant, and a TV that is significantly larger than what will be in your room (12 inch in mine--no joke).- Umbrella'd picnic tables and restaurant patio out front are nice in good weather.- Free morning newspapers (various)- Day-time concierge / trip-planner seemed knowledgeable- Can leave luggage for early arrivals or late departure timesLook out for:- Room choice is key. Mine (117) was clearn, but small and musty-smelling. - The handle on the tub was broken, which I felt was kind of dangerous as you do have to climb in / out, up and down a step as the plumbing is a bit dated. Not much room to navigate within the obligatory shower curtain either.- Rugs throughout needed cleaning or replacement- Noise from other guests and housekeeping begins early. Traffic noise on the front of the buidling can go late.- No AC"
6,1230,"Sep 16 2009 	Hotel was fine	I stayed at this hotel for four nights with my husband and toddler. We had a mixed experience. The first room we were in was on the 1st floor (or second floor by American terms) and would have been fine if we were just a couple. Unfortunately, it was too small with a portable crib and we barely had any room to move around. Nevermind that there were several steps leading down into the room which made it difficult to get a stroller in and out and we had to keep an eye on our toddler. The other downside to the room was that we were on the level with the floodlights that lit up the hotel's exterior at night. Despite closing the curtain, the light still seeped in. We complained to the hotel staff and to their credit, they did shut off the lights early the next night. Since this was the :&quot;balcony&quot; level, we, being paranoid New Yorkers, chose not to open the massive windows/doors at night so it was stuffy. After two nights in our too small room and tempers flaring, we asked to be moved. We were assigned to a room on the third floor and we had a much different experience. There were no steps and we actually had room to move around with the portable crib open. We also had a proper window and could keep it open to allow for air circulation. If we had this room for all four nights, it would have been a much better experience for us as a family. Overall, the hotel was fine. The carpets are worn and stained, you can see the edges of wallpaper peeling, etc. but we considered it all part of the price level that we were willing to pay for. Our rooms were clean. The hotel staff was helpful. We were able to use the wi-fi in both rooms. The breakfast was good. The location was fantastic. I would recommend this hotel but I think it really does depend on which room you get."
7,1230,"Sep 15 2009 	Bayswater experience	Stayed at the Hyde Park Towers Hotel for a weekend away in London. Bayswater is a great location to stay in with the Tube Stations on the door step &amp; Hyde Park &amp; Kensington Gardens just a stones throw away, In February they are great to walk through when the weather is all crisp &amp; cold. The hotel is situated just off the Bayswater Road. The room was small comfortable &amp; clean but very reasonably priced you get what you pay for. When eating out be adventorous there are plenty of restaurants situated on the main high street but if you're going Chinese be prepared to wait the one we went in we had to wait quite a while &amp; to be honest we were disappointed with the seating arrangements as it was cram as many people in as possible it spoilt the meal.We will be doing Bayswater again very soon but will try a different hotel."
8,1230,"Sep 7 2009	Convenient location - too small rooms	We received very pleasant help from the receptionists and the consergiere. Our room were ready when we arrived about 13 .00 hrs. Nice and quiet street. A little noise the first night due to carnival. Beds were nice and clean. Big, nice towels where changed every day! The room with twin beds were so small we could hardly get around. No place to put our suitcases. Bathroom very small too.The interior of the hotel, both room and corridors seemed worn and shabby. The exteriour nice!The hotel restaurant seemed to have no guests. We had our breakfast around the corner on Cafe Roma, very nice!Close to underground stations and near to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park."
9,1230,"Aug 18 2009 	I'll never stay here again	Now that I'm visiting London again and looking at hotels, I wanted to share my experience with Hyde Park Towers. I arrived in London to take the GRE test (I was at the time an American studying in scotland) and checked in, delighted at the exterior of the building, which was gorgeous, and the staff was extremely nice. I get to my room, open the door and notice how small, outdated and dirty the place was...which was ok...and I even didn't care about the random hairs in the bathroom. BUT when it came time for bed, I pulled back the sheets and noticed a cluster of short, black hairs near the pillow. That was it for me, I called the front desk and the man was really nice and put me in a different room. It was in the basement, INCREDIBLY small, I inspected everything and although it was still dirty, no hairs. Great. So I go to sleep...only to be awakened at 4am by a group of guys standing right outside my window, drunk. And they continued for an hour or so. I had to skip my GRE test b/c I didn't get any sleep and I didn't want grad schools to see a bad score...try to explain that one! So finally the next morning I asked for a different room, and they put me on the 3rd floor. Other than that, everything was fine. But the hassle of it all, and the knowledge that they never even changed the sheets in the first room made me want to NEVER stay here again. I would not recommend this place, and I would avoid it! The only good things were the location and the staff."
10,1230,"Aug 10 2009 	Terrible hotel in a brilliant location!	Firstly, I must state that after complaining about my problems, Marcell on reception was excellent. There were no other rooms available for us to swap to so she refunded me 30 and gave myself, my partner and son free full English Breakfasts. However - the basement family room was shocking. Very dirty carpet, a hole in the duvet, bed not made properly, dirty bathroom with mouldy ceiling and shower curtain, no hot water, peeling wallpaper and a very damp smell which was still on our clothes when we got back. We were also told that parking was around the corner at 20 for 24 hours. This isnt true - its a standard car park round the corner that charges by the hour. We Paid 30 for 20 hours. Unimpressed Despite this, its location is great - 5 mins walk from Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and on a lovely quiet street!"
11,1230,"Jul 28 2009 	Im so disapointed!	Choose and booked this hotel in April and asked for a nice room! When me and my husband get there they say all they got left is one room in the basement. And they made us pay 50 pounds deposit although we prepaid for the room &quot;In case something happends&quot;! The wiew (or so called) from the window was a brick wall and the room was so small we couldnt open our suitcases. Moldy shower, no hotwater and a dirty old rug! We complained and got the answer that guests that check in early get the best rooms. We were offererd 2 change in the morning IF we did that before 9.30. And we would not get a new room before the afternoon. So dont stay here, we sure wont again!"
12,1230,"Jul 28 2009 	Extremely exhausted hotel	The room was so tiny with very old and smelly furniture. Although the hotel located at a quiet street, walls at hotel are exremely thin. You should expect to hear walking and knocking starting from 6 am. Staff at hotel charged me for dialing free local number. The breakfast was not bad though."
13,1230,"Jul 9 2009 	Good parts and bad parts about the hotel	Bad parts-I stayed in a single room and it is extremely tiny. I mean &quot;extremely&quot;. I didn't mind that too much but you certainly don't want to &quot;relax&quot; in your room. Well, you can't. If your room is merely a place for you to shower and sleep, then it will be OK.The internet connection (wireless) cannot be received in most rooms although this information is written as &quot;complimentary internet connection in all rooms&quot; in most travel websites. The only place where you can catch the connection is in the bar next to the lobby.Good partsStaff is friendly and polite.No other hotels have better locations!"
14,1230,"Jul 8 2009 	Value location great; but the room the bed sacre bleu!!!!	My wife &amp; I stayed here 29 &amp; 30 April 2009, in room 209. Hey, it's only 2 nights and the photo outside looks nice we thought.So we booked early at a special price, requested an upper floor (to avoid the noises from below per other reviews), and all that was delivered on arrival, even entry a couple of hours before check in time. So far so good. Only a block away from a very cosmopolitan Bayswater as well, plus 2 tube stations and Hyde Park very close. A the breakfast was OK too.The room was so small we couldn,t have two cases on the floor.The bed was totally worn out, when you felt the top surface of the mattress you become intimate with every spring top in the beast. Sleeping on that lot reminded me of a kafir style bed of nails evry time I woke up in pain in the night?And then something bit or scratched my wife on the leg overnight, requiring expensive antibacterial and antiinflammatory treatment a couple of days later.The experience was topped off by a &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; moment on our last morning. My wife fielded a pounding on the door by an agitated man in a suit, while I was in the shower, a flooding directly below she was told. He wanted to check I had the shower curtain tucked inside the tray (I promise I always do!), so he was given short shrift.Stay again there, no!!!. Rated the worst stay of our 42 night travels. Maybe &quot;2 star&quot; and cheap (by London standards) should have sent us a message loud and clear."
15,1230,"Jun 24 2009 	Worn down but clean good value for the money	We booked early and got a 30 % discount, breakfast included. Good value for the money. Carpets and paintwork shabby. Rooms small but we didnt spend much time in the rooms being tourists! More important, rooms and above all bathrooms were CLEAN and staff came in every day. Beds comfortable with great duvets and pillows. You could hear everything in the corridor and other rooms but we were lucky and had a quiet stay. Ask for rooms on second floor and above because of the tube. Staff friendly and helpful (it helps if YOU have a positive attitude!). Happy hour in the afternoon and a very nice outdorr area to sit in. Breakfast quite alright with fresh fruit, breadrolls, ham, cheezes, musli, croissants, eggs. The night time hotel reataurant is not that good.The surroundings great with 2 tubes nearby, 2 large parks, lots of restaurants ( many with low budget prices), pubs, shops and a great mix of people. Felt like a safe area too."
16,1230,"Jun 11 2009 	good location comfortable bed smallest room we've ever stayed in	The location of this hotel is fantastic -- it's steps from two Tube stations, representing three different subway lines. It's near Hyde Park and Kennsington Gardens, and there are restaurants nearby. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the front desk allowed us to run into an empty room for a few minutes to freshen up when we arrived at 7 a.m. (our room wasn't yet available). The room we ran into was a single and quite small, basically a bed and a bathroom. We were optimistic our double room would be more spacious. It was -- by maybe a few feet. It was tiny and cramped. The lights were weird about turning on. No toiletries in the bathroom, other than some soap dispenser thing in the shower that was soap and shampoo in one. The TV was about 9 inches and had few channels. While the bed was comfortable, we were not given a top sheet until we asked for one. And two nights during our five-night stay, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. When we called the front desk after the second alarm, the man who answered said he was just the night porter and couldn't do anything. Turned out that the alarms were going off because someone was smoking in a room. After complaining to a manager, we were offered a complimentary breakfast but the breakfast wasn't much. One morning we asked them to call Harrod's for us to make reservations for tea and they didn't have the phone number and couldn't find it online (we didn't think this an unusual request).Bottom line: good location, tiny room, some weird happenings."
17,1230,"Jun 6 2009 	Great value for money Can't beat the location!!	Stayed in this hotel for one night with my friend for an overnight shopping trip. I had my worries about this hotel after reading previous reviews but I was surprised at how clean the rooms were. Our room wasn't ready when we checked in but our luggage was stored for us. We didn't arrive back to the hotel until later that evening and we found out that we had been upgraded from a twin to a triple room. The triple rooms are located on the third floor and I was happy as I was worried about hearing the tube, as stated in other reviews. The tube could still be heard but not to a level that would be disturbing. The room itself was very small and the bathroom was tiny. But for the amount of time we actually spent in the room, it didn't bother us. The hotel is located literally around the corner from Bayswater tube and about 5mins walk from Queensway. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for a short stay. The value for what you got is brilliant!"
18,1230,"Jun 5 2009 	Deceptive practice by Hotel Mangement	When we arrived at this hotel(hotel A), the Front desk staff told us that there were some maintenance problem, so they booked us to another hotel about 10 minutes driving distance. We asked if there was underground station nearby that hotel. The answer was no. We asked this &quot;hotel A&quot; to place us to some hotel nearby. They sent us to the hotel next door and claimed it was 4-star hotel, I forgot the name of this hotel (I reference it as hotel B). When we checked in this &quot;hotel B&quot;, found the room size small - barely fit for 2 twin beds. The smallest bathroom with a bath tube, a wash basin and a standing area. The &quot;hotel B&quot; did not offer wireless internet as we booked with the original &quot;hotel A&quot; and no breakfast facility. The room window had a brocken latch, it could not be closed. There was another critical problem, our friends supposed to arrive in London next morning and we arranged to have them called us at &quot;hotel A&quot; after they landed at Heathrow Airport. It would be very hard for them to contact us if we switched to another hotel. So we confirmed with the front desk at &quot;hotel A&quot; and asked them to log in their front desk book to notify our friends when they called to let them know that we moved to &quot;hotel B&quot;. Next morning when my friends called &quot;hotel A&quot;, the front desk clerk told them that we did not stay there, she did not bother to read the notes in their book and refused to give my friends the telephone number of another hotel with very similar name. We were very upset for these things to happen and expressed our dissatisfaction to the hotel manager at &quot;hotel A&quot;. He appologized for their mistakes. While we were at &quot;hotel A&quot;, we saw many tourists in and out the lobby, there were many guests in the breatfast room too. We wondered the truth about the so-called &quot;maintenance problem&quot; which they had never specified. We had prepaid our hotel charge with Low Price Guaranteed in January 2009. Did they overbook and used this method to get rid of guests who paid less? Otherwise, how could they have problem to find one room for us when we arrived at noon on May 21? We saw quite few quests were checking out then. We strongly urge Orbitz to stop list this hotel in their website for this type of unfair treatment we had encountered. We have traveled extensively in US and abroad, this is the first time we ran into something like this. We also stayed at two other Hilton hotels in London during our trip. We paid less per night to Hilton hotels with much better accomodations and services."
19,1230,"Jun 4 2009 	OK I suppose but very noisy and worn down. 2 star hotel. Good location.	After stating at this hotel for five nights with my wife and daughter (4), I would describe my feelings about this hotel as very mixed. We arrived in the afternoon and were quite surprised to be kept waiting for half an hour before being let into our room at the official check in at 1500, even though we'd arranged for an early check in when booking the room. We had pretty good expectations for the room, as the lobby looked modern and inviting, and had a plaque on the wall stating it was a runner up for the &quot;best hotel in britain award&quot; (or something likethat) a couple of years earlier. However, the room was at the end of a smelly, dark corridor on the ground floor. The room was small and cramped with three beds (was supposed to be a &quot;family room&quot;) and the looks overall was very shabby. My wife and myself both are NOT very picky when it comes to hotel rooms, but it took about 0.5 seconds to decide that THIS was NOT where we intended to stay for our 5 day vacation! That was before the subway went rumbling by half a meter under the room... every three minutes form 0500-2400 as it turned out... I went to the lobby, ready to raise h*** and contact our booking agency if necessary, but managed to remain friendly.... We could not change rooms the same day, but were told that the next we would get a &quot;superior&quot; room on an upper floor, as the hotel was full (plausible, as this was the sunday of the London Marathon!). The night in our room was the worst ever, and I tell you that spending the night with a fully awake, cranky and travel weary 4 year old, while the subway shakes the whole room all night is NOT the way you want to spend your holiday. The next day we were given a room on the third floor which was bigger and better, but very noisy. Apparantly London does not have any regulations regarding noise pollution, as the room faced a back yard where an assortment of fans, air conditioners etc. made a lot of noise - and the windows were single layer, of course. The bathroom was extremely small. Carpets had strange stains and was approx. 30 years old. The door to our room had a gap between it and the floor that was about 4 cm, so we heard everything in the hallway... But that's what earplugs are for, right??HOWEVER: It was clean, there were enough towels, beds were changed every day and the staff didn't complain when we informed them our daughter had an accident in her bed. The room was very cold, but when I asked, the reception had a radiator brought to our room. The breakfast was not at all bad, and the concierge was helpful with checking a couple of things for us and getting transportation. All in all we had a quite pleasant stay, but we probably won't come back.If you plan on staying at this hotel, make sure you get a room on the top floor, facing the street. Then, at least , you will have some quiet.PS: The hotel homepage does not lie. The beds really were new and quite OK; there were real down pillows and duvets. The breakfast was (barely) as described. But don't believe the pictures, as they only tell half the tale. I paid about GBP 55 per night for 3 people including breakfast, by the way, and the value for money was OK."
20,1230,"May 21 2009 	Very good price for the package	Good hotel for its price range, very close to subway and free wireless internet in the rooms and hotel. I Recommend. Only problem was the breakfast staff, not the most friendly in the world."
21,1230,"May 19 2009 	Absolutely fine	Read some terrible reviews before we stayed here, so before we arrived, we rang and requested upper floor rooms. They did initially give us 2 basement rooms, but without too much fuss they then offered us rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors. We were prepared for the tiny bathrooms! Rooms clean, beds very comfortable plenty of hot water and for the amount we paid (60 per night) thought it was very reasonable. Location excellent. Would definately stay here again if we could be guaranteed an upper room. Must be very noisy in basement (underground).Liked best: LocationLiked least: Small bathroom"
22,1230,"May 9 2009 	best location for great price!	myself and my friend stayed here in sepember 2008 when we went to london for shopping and to see the sites! even though we arrived at the hotel really early they kindly let us take a room..beware.. always get one upstairs, we got bottom floor room, stank of smoke,and the floor shook every few minutes with the tubes passing underneath!!! very basic breakfast but other than that no amenities at the hotel. very close to tubes (2) and ideal location except kind of dodgy at night!! got major discount off the price for booking online so was worth! nice place but could also be cleaner, needs a new coat of paint!"
23,1230,"Apr 22 2009 	Fantastic location average room for single traveller	I booked a single room for three nights. The room was very small and the bathroom was even smaller. The bed was comfortable and clean.The location was fantastic, Queensway was just around the corner with it's shops and restaurants.The staff was friendly and the breakfast was great, too.So if you're a single traveller like me, and want to spend a few nights quite comfortably in a great location and don't mind the small rooms and shabbyness, I would recommend this hotel for you."
24,1230,"Mar 30 2009 	Average small hotel	This was my first hotel experience in the UK. After comparing it to others in Glasgow and Edinburgh this one came in at the bottom. As others have mentioned, it's close to the tube and the park. Starbucks and other cafes are close. The rooms were very small but clean. The bathroom was even smaller. Full tub and shower, but not much room to maneuver. The breakfast was decent. Cold cuts, cheese, European yogurt, and coffee/juice. Hot breakfast for more money. Staff were very nice, but I felt continually cramped. Only one lift and the stairs and hallways were very narrow. Would stay here again if I had to, but next time I'm going to pay a little more for some extra comfort."
25,1230,"Mar 17 2009	Good location is about all I can say about this place.	This was one of the worst stays I've ever had at a hotel. I'll start off with the positives. It's a pretty good location as it's a block from Hyde park, and close to two tube locations. And they have a great happy hour. Now for the rest. This place does all they can to suck every dollar out of you, and gives you absolutely no quality service in return. The beds are god awful uncomfortable. You know the commercials for mattresses where every square inch contours to your body? Well, imagine that kind of bed, except its more like every square yard contours. You can't lay on your side period, and it's uncomfortable to lay on your back. The rooms are as small as you'd expect from a European hotel, so no surprises there. However the absolute worst part of the trip, and where I see no excuse for failure is that of the hotel staff. The front desk customer service is non-existent. I received a bill for 45 pounds for local phone calls. If you are going to charge for local calls fine, but you also need to let people know that. I made only local calls and was charged 45 pounds. This came after trying to extend my stay because my mother was hospitalized on the trip, and the manager, who was in the room behind the counter, was too busy to come speak to me. One of the staff at the desk had to run relay back and forth between me and her. And they basically weren't willing to do anything. They claimed they were overbooked, despite the night before being told that they had rooms. I'm used to american hotels where if a hotel is booked, they will call other hotels for you and help you find a new place. All the help I got from them was, &quot;there are more hotels on this block you can look at.&quot; Perhaps I'm whiny, but I expect hotels to make some effort to help, especially after telling them that a family member has been hospitalized for days and you're already at wits end. This place was god awful and would never go back there again.Oh yea, and how could I forget the incredibly overpriced, HORRIFIC food they offer in the restaurant. The dinner is edible, however avoid the awful breakfast. It's easily the worst &quot;buffet&quot; I've ever seen. I put buffet in quotes because they offer a wide selection of semi stale flavorless break, lunch meat, cheese, and bad yogurt."
26,1230,"Mar 16 2009 	Good budget hotel great location	I stayed at this hotel in February 2009, with my parents for a theatre break. The hotel is an a good location just a few minutes away from Hyde park and near to bayswater underground. The hotel staff were friendly and willing to help if you needed anything. The rooms were clean and a good size for just a couple of nights, we had a triple room and the space was fine, we have stayed in smaller! One downfall was we were on the ground floor so there was some noise from the underground, I understand this is to be expected of a lot of ground floor rooms in london but we were not advised about this on arrival or by our booking agent. The continental breakfast is really nice with a good selection of cereals, pastries etc. The bar has a happy hour 4-7 everyday, they have a good selection of drinks although when I stayed the draught lager was coming out warm and very lively don't know if its like this all of the time or just bad while we were there. Overall this is a good budget hotel in a great location."
27,1230,"Mar 6 2009 	Great value great location great service!	We stayed here on a mini-break to London. The price we paid was a bargain for London especially considering what we got for the money. The hotel is in a good location on the circle line and is no more than 200m from the tube, there are numerous restaurants and souvenir shops very close to the hotel and it is also a stone's throw away from Hyde Park. The rooms were not the biggest but a good size for London with comfy beds and everything you could really need for a short break. Breakfast was included in the price (although cooked breakfast was 3) but the buffet breakfast was more than you coud need! Cereals, fruit, eggs, pastries, bread, cooked meat &amp; cheeses, muffins. The staff were very friendly and more than willing to help. Free newspapers provided, you can buy tickets for days out from the hotel, we didn't use the bar/restaurant but they do have special offers and give us vouchers to spend in the bar.Would definitely stay there again!"
28,1230,"Mar 6 2009 	Great location	I meant to write about this hotel long ago but never find time to. I stayed in this hotel august 2008 and London was the last stop before I headed back to Hong Kong. Since I was only spending 3 nights in London and with the main aim to be shopping, I needed a hotel in a good and safe location and most important of all, would not cost me an arm or a leg. The Hyde Park Towers was just I was looking for. It is situated between the two tube station Queensway and Bayswater. It will only take you 3 - 5 mins to walk to either station. You can also find various bus stops around the corner which will bring you to all main areas and less than 15 mins to the famous Oxford Street where Topshop and Selfridges are. There are also numerous restaurants , fast food stores and small supermarkets around the hotel vicinity where you can easily grab a bite.The girl in the reception area ( sorry I forgot her name) was very helpful and she suggested that I should get an oyster card which saved me quite a lot (you pay 1 pound instead of 3 for buses) when I used it on buses and underground and I didnt need to have all those coins and queued up for tickets.The size of the room is very small ( I got a single room) and they have a small bathroom too. But as I am a petite person, that doesnt really bother me.The only thing that I didnt like about the hotel was the noise. The walls were thin and I could actually hear when people closed their doors and when they were walking in the corridor. It could bother you if you are a light sleeper. Apparently they had a very sensitive smoke alarm system and I was waken up twice by the fire alarm because some jerks smoked in their rooms. If you go to London mainly for sight seeing and shopping, then this is the hotel for you. I will definitely come back to this hotel for my next shopping trip."
29,1230,Feb 23 2009 	Much better than I was expectimg	We came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were very pleasantly surprised by the size and standard of room we were allocated on the third floor. The location is brilliant.. Two tubes nearby and lots of places to eat. The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very good with lots to choose from. We would stay here again and recommend it.
30,1230,"Feb 8 2009 	Is a great London budget hotel	We'd read a couple of slightly negative reviews about this hotel so were expecting the low-end of budget. So SO pleasantly surprised. Our flight had been delayed by snow at Gatwick (Feb 4) so we arrived later than expected. Reception was friendly and welcoming and the foyer promised much more than budget. Our room was 109: spotlessly clean, huge bed (actually 2 twins pushed together) the bathroom was tiny but fine and spotless, t.v. on the wall - of the bedroom, not the bathroom. (If the bed had been a standard double there would have been room for a couple of chairs but obviously the room could've been doubled as a twin.The bed linen/towels were changed daily even though we had done the green thing and said we were OK with the same linen. The four pillows were down (!) and luxurious. We were here for 4 nights and it was great - for a long stay not so sure, but this is simply due to the fact that they utilise the space in each bedroom to the maximum so it was a wee bit cramped. Having said this, the hotel is within 50 metres of Queensway and probably 200 metres of Westbourne Grove and the choice of restaurants, bars, pubs and cinemas is superb so you don't really need to stay inside for long. Also the bar does a happy hour from 4 to 7, is comfortable, free newspapers and the restaurant has an Italian buffet which looked good, tho' we didn't try it out preferring Indian and Chinese cuisine.Downside? Well some reviews said they could hear the tube but I think these rooms must have been on either ground or sub-ground level. We very occasionally heard the rumble - possibly once or twice - no big deal at all. And for those that are really naffed off about threadbare carpets, well, what can I say? It's IS a budget hotel, in a great location, so you get what you pay for, n'est pas?"
31,1230,"Jan 28 2009 	Pretty good	We booked this hotel through Expedia for a lower price than on the hotel's website (about 50 a night). We stayed 4 nights with breakfast excluded.The first good thing about this hotel is it's location near the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. And near the hotel are various restaurants, some cuzy pubs, shops and supermarkets. The area is pretty lively even at night, but the hotel is located in a quieter street.The reception staff was friendly, even though some lines seemed a bit 'rehearsed'. We were asked to leave a 50 GBP deposit and we received a discount voucher for the hotel restaurant. The lobby looked nice, and the hallways of the hotels smelled pretty good with the aid of air-freshner.We booked a twin, but in the room was a double bed. Considering this bed was pretty big (Queensize) and there was an extra duvet, we decided not to make a fuss about it. The room was located on the frontside of the hotel and the outdoor spotlight was lighting our room in a very sun-like manner. This was not a problem since the thick curtain hid the light completely, it was a nice touch actually!The room definately needed some updating, especially the carpet. It all looked a little bit dated and shabby, but the bed linen was absolutely clean and so was the bathroom. The beds were made every day and when requested the linen would be changed. Huge towels in the bathroom also. The TV only had a few channels and wasn't working very well, but we weren't visiting in London to watch tv! The size of the room was ok. We had an absolutely quiet night and we could hardly hear the tube (on the first floor).I'd stayed here before a couple of years ago and remembered that it's not the most fantastic hotel in the world, but if you're looking for a budget hotel with a great location, and if you're not picky about the look of a hotel room then this is definately a good option."
32,1230,"Jan 25 2009 	Beafeater	Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was concerned after reading reviews. However, staff were friendly and continental breakfast presentation was excellent. Manager in charge was very professional and helpful. Room was on third floor and was tired looking and in need of refurb. Cleanliness was good and bed linen and towels were excellent.Staff were helpful but I did find Russian barmaid (maybe Lativan) in the bar was talking too much to some customers. The other staff were helpful and polite.The Italian buffet offered was not appetising and could do with a re-think. Whoever designed this menu has no idea on what to offer as I spoke to other customers who also found the menu terrible and laughable. A cold buffet is not satisfactory. I ended up eating out in the evenings in the Bayswater area which offers a variety of restaurants and some good Italian restaurants with an excellent menu choice.Overall, a good budget class hotel."
33,1230,"Jan 21 2009 	Great value!	The location of Hyde Park Towers was sweet, the Bayswater Underground Station being just aorund the corner. The downfall of this was the frequent sounds of the Tube going under the hotel, but it wasn't that disturbing at all. Our room was ensuite and large enough to serve our needs. It also came with a TV (small) and tea &amp; coffee amenities. The overall impression was good, but be prepared for a dirty window sill and grey-from-dirt curtains. The bed, however, was extremely comfy and that is just what we needed.The staff at the hotel was friendly, but always seemed a bit busy. Upon arrival, we were allowed to leave our luggage there already at 8am (check-in was at 3pm), which was great.The hotel offers a buffet breakfast that is absolutely wonderful for 5.99. They also give some 20% discount deals at the hotel restaurant, which we never got around to using.The hotel was all in all a pleasant experience. For the amount we we paid, I would definitely stay there again!"
34,1230,"Jan 20 2009 	Great budget hotel!	My freinds and I stayed at the Hyde Park Towers Jan 10th-14th. We got a triple room and it had 3 twin beds. The room was good, bedding nice and clean, bathroom was small but def mangeable. The hotel is easy to get to by the tube, its 1 block away from the Bayswater stop and about 2 blocks away from the Queensway stop. There are many restaurants, shops and pubs in walking distance and Hyde Park is 2 blocks away. The price of room included the continental breakfast, which was great, there was always pastries, cereals, fruit, meat and cheese, coffee, tea, juice and then you could elect to get english breakfast for like 3 gbp more. When we checked in we got there early, we couldnt go to our room but they have a luggage room and we stored our bags there until we could check in. My only complaint and it wasnt even a problem was that, where our room was you could hear the tube train, it wasn't loud enough to be disruptive and it didn't shake the room, but you could def hear it, but our room was towards the back of the hotel, you couldn't hear it anywhere else though and the tube doesnt run from 12:30am-6am so it really wasn't a problemSo overall, if you're looking for a budget place to stay, this is the place its clean, friendly and alot better than anything else you're going to find at this price!"
35,1230,"Jan 19 2009 	Much better than I thought!	I was very worried having seen some of the reviews on tripadvisor but I have to say I was happy with the hotel. I ended up with a basement room (number 24). I had requested not to be in the basement or on the ground floor, and hotel offered to change my room for the second night if I wanted. I was happy with the room and didn't bother changing it for the second night. There was the noise of the underground trains running but it wasn't really too bad - definitely not worth complaining about anyway. Room was small but very comfortable. Heating was very good and room was clean. Also had free WiFi which was excellent. I didn't leave anything valuable in the room after reading some previous reviews! Hotel does offer safe keeping though if you need it. Only complaint would be the lukewarm water for a shower. Perhaps it was because it was late morning when I took them but it is something the hotel should try and remedy. I would stay again."
36,1230,"Jan 19 2009 	Great location bigger rooms than I thought!	I stayed at the hotel for approx 4 nights with 2 of my friends. It was great that they were able to hold our bags for us, as we arrived in London well before the check-in time (we got there around 9am when check it was around 1pm). Since there were 3 of us, our room actually had 3 separate twin size beds, which were actually pretty comfortable. The room size was much better than I thought it would be, considering I read a lot of reviews on London hotels that complained about room size. The bathroom was also a decent size, and the shower always had hot water, and great water pressure. One thing I did find weird, and I noticed this at our other hotel as well, is that you have to literally step up and into the shower, so if you can't make the step up, it would be difficult to use the shower (esp for any older individuals or anyone with any disabilities).The one complaint we did have, was that (and I believe it happened to be our room, given it's location - room 60) the tube station was apparently directly underneath us, so you could hear the trains running - at least they stopped at midnight, and usually didn't start again till around 6am. Also, the room was FREEZING. *Note: I found that wherever I stayed or went indoors in London, it was always freezing, so it must just be a common trend and not something specific to this hotel.We had the continental breakfast while we stayed there. The breakfast &quot;bar&quot; included pastries, juices, coffee / tea, meats / cheeses, fruit, yogurt, and cereal. No complaints regarding the breakfast.Overall, the hotel and staff were great - I really enjoyed the location as it's very close to 2 tube stations, tons of restaurants, some pubs and shops. It was also walking distance to Notting Hill and Hyde Park.I would definitely stay here again on another trip to London."
37,1230,"Jan 13 2009 	Great Location Great Value	I wanted to find an inexpensive hotel in London to lay my head in the evening knowing that I would be out and about most of the day. After searching on orbitz and expedia I found a variety of interesting properties at attractive rates but Hyde Park Towers had special rates on both sites that were really hard to beat. I read a ton of reviews here on tripadvisor that were not entirely positive but I booked anyway as the rate was sweet and I'm not a finicky traveler.I must say I was very pleasantly surprised as Hyde Park Towers was really a great place to stay made even better by the low room rate. As is frequently mentioned, the location is fantastic, near Hyde Park, close to tons of restaurants and in a very nice neighborhood, close to Portabello market and 2 underground stations. The reception area is professional and organized, and the hotel has modern credit card style keys (many budget hotels make you stop at the front desk to get your key which I HATE.) There's a nice bar area and an elevator to the 3rd floor where I stayed (I mostly walked the stairs but it was nice to have the elevator available).My rate came with the &quot;English Breakfast&quot; which was too heavy for me (bacon/eggs/etc), but I was content with the very nice buffet which was all I needed. The breakfast was really quite good, but crowded if you don't get there early.The room was small but adequate for me, plenty of room for my backpack and stuff. Nonetheless, if you are a very large person or need lots of space, this hotel might not be for you.As to noise, it's always a crapshoot anywhere you stay. In general people are polite and keep it down, but one evening a group was pretty loud/rude and you could for sure hear it, but for 2 other nights it was fine, no issues. I've experienced noisy neighbors at much better hotels for much higher rates so I can't fault the hotel. Oh yeah, you will hear the tube, but it wasn't an issue for me being on the 3rd floor, although it might be louder the closer you are to the ground. It certainly wasn't loud enough to wake me up.Side note, I was taking the Eurostar to Brussels at 6:00 AM and was thinking the hotel was going to be an expensive cab ride but the 390 bus runs 24 hours, stops 1 block from the hotel and goes directly to St. Pancras/Kings Cross station."
38,1230,"Jan 3 2009 	Do Not Go There !	DO NOT GO. We went there for buisness and we stayed for 10 days. On Christmas eve laptops, passports etc were stolen from inside our room as well as from other seven (!) rooms, without even violating the doors which made the whole thing look like an inside job. Needless to say that there was no reimbushment from the hotel, they did not even discuss about it. The personnel completely ignored us and the owner showed up one day later, and as soon as he saw as he run away so as to avoid talking to us. Additionally the rest of the days we stayed there everyone in the hotel was rather rude towards us and behaved as if nothing had happended. Apart from hte loss of money the stealing of our laptop entails, we also lost all of our work, for which we visited London. Definitely do not go to this hotel unless you want to get robbed off your valuablesl!!"
39,1230,"Dec 31 2008 	Maybe for the breakfast...	Ok. So everything worked - I got my hotel room, breakfast everyday, was charged the right amounts. Also, the staff was quite helpful and the room was cleaned everyday. And yes, it is London we are talking about, so I really wasn't expecting a lot. However, I was disappointed with the hotel room. The public areas were ok, but the room... there were mostly problems in the bathroom, mold in the ceiling. Also, the room was very cold when keeping the bathroom door open, not to mention the showers in the ice cold bathroom (water was warm, but there was cold air coming in from somewhere). If the bathroom door was kept closed, the room turned super hot and the air got bad in the miniscule closet of a room.The 2 points basically come from the practical aspects being handled, the nice bed and the super breakfast.However, the bathroom experience left me feeling a bit dirty, so I would not book this place again."
40,1230,"Dec 31 2008 	Loved it!!!	Lovely hotel, nice staff and delicious food. Good value for money."
41,1230,"Dec 29 2008 	Beware!!!	We checked in Christmas Eve 2008. Dropped off our bags, went out to grab a bite to eat came back to find our new laptop computer had been stolen right out of the room! We went downstairs to find many other people at the front desk complaining. They had their rooms broken into as well. Stolen passports, money, cameras, and many laptop computers. It was bad enough that it was christmas eve but even worse the hotel did absolutely nothing to help us or reassure us the matter would be handled. We did not get a refund on the room. We were offered 2 free drinks as a comp and then later we were charged for them. We had approval by the manager to call the States to call our banks, insurance companies, the local police etc. and then we were billed for the calls upon checkout! It was absolutely an awful experience. The manager had no customer service, we were treated terribly the rest of our stay. Needless to say, were waiting on the police report and having a talk with our lawyer. Must have been an inside job as there was no forced entry into any of the rooms. We asked to speak to owner several times. The owner avoided us the entire trip and was nowhere to be seen upon checkout and a huge bill for the phone calls. This experience was on top of the tiny, cramped room, the dirty carpet and moldy bathroom. Travelers Beware!"
42,1230,"Dec 2 2008	perfect for a weekend	After reading some of the reviews I didn't know what to expect. We booked one double and one twin and spent 3 nights in this hotel. The rooms (309 and 315) were ok and the badroom was tiny but clean.The breakfast was better than expected: fruit, juices, bread, ham, cheese and all types of pastries and rolls.I will definatelly repeat. It's a good hotel for those who want to explore London. It's close to Oxford street and hyde park, and the metro (bayswater) is just behind the hotel."
43,1230,"Nov 11 2008 	Don't do it!!!!!	I am struggling to write this review with one hand following a nasty incident which involved me getting my finger hurt at this hotel, so perhaps I am biast. But my sore finger kind of sums this place up... Fawlty towers (without the humour). Great location, but that's about it. The place was grubby (dirty bathroom, filthy carpets). Wierd TV - German porn TV channels??!! The rooms were very small and dark. Twin beds when you booked a double. Most of all, however, I got the impression they had cut corners (literally) to fit the maximum number of people in here. Surely there are health and safety issues here? My own fateful incident involved slamming the ladies toilet door into a wall that I didn't expect to be there (the door only opened half way and there was no stopper between the door and the unexpected wall). My finger got caught somewhere in between. If I were you, I'd stick to the standard chains - Days Inns, Best Western, Travellodge etc - which are in a similar price bracket rather than the many dodgey looking hotels in Bayswater area. At least you will hopefully return with all fingers intact."
44,1230,"Oct 25 2008 	Not twice	We were booked into this hotel so that we could attend a business meeting. Public spaces are OK but the food was sub- standard and the rooms (single occupancy) were shabby with interesting mould in the bathroom/shower. The majority of rooms are accessed by stairs rather than a lift and could pose a problem to anyone with mobility concerns, The staff were doing their best to be helpful and were all very friendly and courteous but were let down by the standard of the rooms and the bizarre fire alarm system which in less than 12 hours went off 3 times (false alarms). The deciding moment was when 'housekeeping' very charmingly knocked on my door at 8.00 am just to check that I was leaving that day. I could see that the hotel was popular with tourists probably because of the price but the staff deserve a standard of food and accommodation to match their enthusiasm."
45,1230,"Sep 23 2008	good hotel	we stayed at the hyde park towers from 19th of sept to the 22nd ,the hotel is just off queensway and is in a great location from bayswater tube station (about 1 min walk) the hotel its self is a good value clean hotel, the staff are very friendly and helpful,they do a happy hour from 4-7 every day which was buy one get one free,we were also provided with pizza and olives to nibble on,Our rooms were small but clean a treat to come back to after busy days out ,all 7 of us agreed that we would definatly use this hotel again and reccomend it, thanks to all at hyde park towers"
46,1230,"Aug 28 2008 	A lot better than expected	After reading reviews here, I was quite anxious getting here actually. But I had really no need to worry, the place was great. Well, not a five star luxury resort, but for paying about 300 I was satisfied.Friendly staff, and check in went quickly. I had asked to not get a basement or ground floor room, and we got a double room on floor 2. On floor 2 you didn't feel a thing from the underground going by, as mentioned in other reviews, but if it was completely quiet in the room you could hear it. But we were definitely not disturbed by it.The room was okay, a little small but not disturbingly I'd say. We had place to leave our two bags open on the floor. A little tight getting from the foot of the bed to the desk because of the bench the TV stood on, but we managed. Bathroom is small, but it's okay, and the huge mirror makes the whole bathroom look bigger. Our towels were changed on a daily basis (we stayed here for 3 nights). Everything was clean but maybe could use some paint. But why do you have to think about that, when you're in London you don't spend much time in your hotel room.We had continental breakfast included and it was excellent. The location is great, barely takes 1 minute to walk to Bayswater tube station (District &amp; Cirle lines), and Queensway station with Central line is just 5 mins away."
47,1230,"Aug 25 2008 	Good base little else	We recently stayed in London for one night before venturing to Scotland, and this hotel served as our crashing point after a long flight. Everything about the room was small (size, tv, bed, bathroom, shower), though I will also say that it was clean and functioned properly. The best aspect of staying at the hotel is likely its location, which is less than two blocks to the tube station and makes it easy to get around the city. Bayswater is also a fun little area, with plenty of restaurants and shops. The hotel served its purpose as home base for one night, and it didnt cost an arm and a leg. If you are looking for more amenities and service, however, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
48,1230,"Aug 24 2008 	Suffered micro earthquakes every few minutes!	The best thing about this hotel is the great location: a quiet street just less than 100 metres of the busy and commercial Queensway. Also mention that there are two underground stations within walking distance, this is great.The hotel itself has a impressive victorian facade with two small steps to raise to be able to enter the lobby.But nobody told me that I had to save another &quot;9&quot; steps (2-2-1-2-2) to finally reach my room, which was located on ground level. Also had to cross a semicovered patio with a metal grid floor. Quiet surprising really!The rooms are rather old looking, small size (especially for two or more people), the furniture is rather tatty, the carpets not too clean, the matrisse rather &quot;flat and bashed&quot; and I also had to descend two steps to enter it.But the worst of all, by far and I would like to REMARK THIS POINT: the Circle/District underground line passes just under this hotel. Please note that this underground line is high level (aprox 3-5 metres below) and I had to suffer 10 second micro earthquakes every couple of minutes. I admit that after a few days I got used to it but, if you can avoid the ground floor, avoid it.Another BAD point is that:If anyone has the great idea of smoking a ciggy at 04:00 am, the fire alarm will go off in the hotel. I also suffered this several times in one night and ended up complaning at reception at 07:00am.Once again: a great location but a VERY average hotel. Think twice."
49,1230,"Aug 18 2008 	Great location	The first thing you need to remember is that London hotel rooms are TINY! We've been to several different places in London and all have been &quot;compact&quot;.Hyde Park Towers, however, excels in everything else. The staff are friendly and incredibly helpful. The breakfast room is large and well stocked. The decor, although a little dated in some areas, is neat and constantly being refurbished. Bedding and towels are very good and the rooms are cleaned every day. To be honest, how many people head to London in order to spend time in a hotel room?Without a doubt the best asset of Hyde Park Towers is the location. Thirty seconds walk from the Bayswater tube station, 10 minutes from Hyde Park. Situated next to Queensway it is also close to shops, restaurants and bars. Central London and the tourist hotspots are only a couple of minutes away on the tube. We used the hotel for a 3 day break and found it an ideal base for sightseeing."
50,1230,"Jul 23 2008 	Ideal spot for a stay in London!	After reading some of the reviews, as usual, we weren't sure what to expect. This is an older building, as most are in London. Our rooms were great for the money, bedding was immaculate and beds are very comfortable. We were on the third floor, heard no Tube noise, or any noise for that matter, although the floors were squeaky so those below us may have had a different experience. It is a FANTASTIC location in terms of Tube access and great/cheap places to eat nearby (stay clear of the Art Cafe for breakfast, putrid and overpriced). You're only a few minutes walk from Hyde Park, which is fantastic. You'll want to keep something on your feet as the carpets were a bit dodgy. And yes, the bathrooms are small, but it's LONDON! They serve the purpose and the staff are helpful and friendly. The bar also has great drink specials, so enjoy!"
51,1230,"Jul 17 2008 	Pretty Good	we stayed in june to go to see the foo fighters in Wembly. First of all good location, 10min walk to paddington can't complain with that. The room was on the small side with a crap view but our friends who joined us had a really big room, but for 75 i cant really moan.We had the italian buffet for lunch which our some of us had lasagne and canneloni which was nice and others had pizza buffet which was ok but you could tell had been left to stand.We had breakfast, great no issues and also had a few drinks in the bar after the gig. Super helpful gent on reception who didnt bug you to pay just let you chill out and enjoy your time also we were in there till gone 2 and he said 'so long as your not noisy dont worry' we could have stayed up all night if we wanted to.Overall great stay, would stay there again next time."
52,1230,Jul 9 2008 	Will think twice about rebooking	My husband and I stayed for two nights at the end of June on a bed and breakfast basis. The staff in reception are very helpful but the room was very small. We had a twin room en suite and it was difficult to walk round the bottom of the bed as it seemed to just fit the length of the room and was right up against the wardrobe. The room was clean but in need of a coat of paint to spruce it up a bit. On the second night somebody tried to gain access to our room during the night and we were awakened with the noise of the door handle being rattled. Luckily I was not alone and my husband shouted out and who ever it was went away. The fire alarm also went off during the night but was a false alarm. Breakfast was fine but if you wanted anything cooked you had to pay extra for it. The hotel is in a good location and very near to Bayswater tube station and Kensington Gardens which is probably its best feature. OK for the odd overnight stay but not for a long break.
53,1230,"Jul 7 2008 	Ok - if all you want is a base	My partner and I just spent 2 nights at this hotel. We normally stay in the Ibis at Euston , but as we were attending a music event in Hyde Park we decided to stay in a location nearer to the park.Initial impressions were good. Both the outside of the hotel and the reception areas are well presented. It is also very easy to find from both Bayswater and Queensway tube station. We checked in easily and were placed in room 62 which is on the ground floor. In order to get to this room we had to go down a very narrow corridoor and over a metal bridge. The room was the smallest room we've ever stayed in. You couldn't even access the bed from both sides, and the bathroom was absolutely tiny. A number of things in the room look a bit grubby from wear and tear (carpets and shower screen to name two) but the room was clean. We also discovered that our room was on the corner of the building right next to the street, and the windows aren't double glazed so you heard everything that was happening outside. Also all the floor boards seemed to creak so there's no way to move around the room quietly.We didn't pay much for the room, and were only using the room as a base so we managed for the few nights we were there but we wouldn't have been impressed if we'd paid the going rate that was advertised.Good: Location - handy for shops and tube as well as Hyde Park/Kensington Bad: Size and outside noise"
54,1230,"Jul 1 2008 	What an experience!!	We have just returned from this hotel after spending five nights. The good points being the rooms were clean and the staff friendly. Now the bad points. Although we booked two single rooms away back in February we were told the only two rooms available were situated on the lower ground floor, The rooms were very far apart and I had to travel over the fire escape to get to my room. My mum is 80 years old and we had to carry our cases ourselves (nobody offered to help). On complaining they moved us to other rooms on the first floor after the first night. Talk about the rooms being small. If I had been overweight I would not have been able to squeeze past the sink and toilet to get to the bath. There were no cords on the blinds in my room and therefore could not be opened. I found cords in one of the drawers and tied them up myself. On going down for a meal we were told by a member of staff not to eat at the hotel or we may have to spend the rest of the night on the toilet (her words). There are so many other bad points and I would DEFINITELY not go back!! Be warned!!"
55,1230,"Jun 27 2008 	Mixed Review	My Mom and I stayed in this hotel for one night while stopping through London. We chose the hotel based on price (about $190 USD which is not that bad in London) and location. There were both goods and bads about this hotel.GOOD: Free internet; great breakfast (which was included in our price); lobby bar with happy hour specials; located close to shops, restaurants, and a tube stop; very close to Kensington Gardens. The bed was very comfy, and everything was very clean.BAD: Our room was probably one of the smallest rooms I have ever seen, and the bathroom was even smaller. The carpets are also in dire need of replacement (in the rooms and the rest of the hotel). Even though the location was good in some ways, we usually stay closer to Westminster while in London and this was definitely far enough away that we had to take either the tube or taxi to get to any local attractions (aside from Kensington).Overall, it wasn't a bad stay, but next time we will probably pay a little more and stay at Sanctuary House Hotel, which is where we usually stay."
56,1230,Jun 23 2008 	Be Careful	This hotel has a great location near to Hyde Park. The room we stayed in was very small but comfortably furnished. The bathroom was very very small and overall decor was fading with stains on the carpet and paint peeling from woodwork. A word of warning when taking breakfast. The staff do not make it clear that when you have paid for breakfast this does not include the cooked breakfast. The 5.90 extra we paid for cooked breakfast was wasted on the inedible excuse of a meal they gave to us. Also be careful when arriving by car as the traffic wardens wait around the corner while you are checking in to catch you out. The Hyde Park Towers is ok if you need one night to crash out in London and don't need any space in your room and don't care what you eat at breakfast.
57,1230,"Jun 12 2008 	Terrible Room Good Location Friendly Staff	Booked Triple Room through United.Com and followed up with two separate emails to assure three twin beds. Upon arrival my daughter checked in (before my son and I) and was placed in a room with a double bed and a pull out sofa. We arrived at midnight and there was no triple rooms available.Since this was a three night stay and one night was gone we did not switch rooms.The room was small, no air conditioning, floors creaked, and no storage. The fold out sofa blocked the armoir so it could not be used for storage.Bathroom was functional but space shuttle sized.Staff was friendly, concierge very helpful, and breakfast was good.Terrible value."
58,1230,"Jun 11 2008	Perfect location!	Having read the reviews we were somewhat anxious to visit this hotel mid May. Several months before we had booked online a triple room for two adults and our teenager daughter for 3 nights. I had especially made clear that we wanted a room on 2nd floor or above because of the tube. We checked in early in the morning, left our luggage and came back to the hotel late evening to find that we had got room 60 (ground level). On our hotel card were a couple of room numbers on 2nd resp. 3rd floor; these had been crossed out and no. 60 added (as if it was intended that we got the room we had asked for. I guess that others arriving after us had become room 60 and complained, and because we came back so late, we ended up with room 60). Room 60 was a cigar box with a tiny window to a shaft with no daylight. Very uncomfortable. We were moved to the 2nd floor next day, a light, but very, very small room with 3 excellent beds, no space at all for us or our luggage. Everything in the room was worn and shabby, BUT the location is perfect, breakfast good and the price absolutely fair (booked online). I would consider going back.... Birgitte &amp; family"
59,1230,"Jun 6 2008 	Great value for money	I was coming down to London for one nights clubbing and found a great deal on Lastminute.com with a friend. As we are both young with a limited budget we thought we could grin and bear anything, but we really needn't have been so worried.Reception was immaculate and impressive looking. Helpful staff helped us check our luggage in, which was so handy as we had got the overnight bus down from Glasgow, and were able to get out and about for the day totally hassle free.The location of Hyde Park Towers was a very short walk from Bayswater Tube so we were able to travel into the centre of London so conveniently. When we checked in and got to our room, it seemed basic and clean - just what we needed really. The bathroom was however really tiny. Not enough room to get dried and ready in there after showering but there was a pc with internet access downstairs so we were able to just let each other have the room to themselves in order to get ready. Shower was very powerful, which was also a bonus.To be honest I've been put off booking in again due to the bathroom, but this is quite typical of everywhere in London, and for the money we paid we really couldn't argue. If you're considering staying here definately book ahead over the internet as reception prices were astronomical! A great clean, budget hotel - I say go for it!"
60,1230,"Jun 6 2008	Window Pains	I researched many hotels in London and this one seemed fine (even the reviews on this forum were good), but when I arrived for my one night stay - I was NOT impressed. The outside looks great, the reception is welcoming and the staff very friendly - it is the rooms that let this hotel down and that's what you are after all paying for - somewhere to sleep! (most people anyway).I was given a tiny single room at the side of the hotel (although I had paid for a twin) - the windows are old and very thin and the busy street outside was right next to the window. A couple decided to sit on the wall outside and start singing! (it sounded like they were in the room although there would not have been enough space for the 3 of us!) I asked at reception if they would ask them to move, they said it would be easier to offer me another room - 'OK'. Room 2 was at the back of the hotel, even smaller than the first and was unmade - towels on the floor, wet floor mat in the bathroom. I asked for another room... Room 3 - a twin room at last, but the door was ajar when I arrived and it wouldn't lock, again I complained - the receptionist was very helpful &amp; courteous, but this does not help when there are so many problems. He came up to the room and the lock seemed to be working OK this time - then as we stepped into the room, the towels were on the floor, the bucket was full - I insisted the room had not been made and his answer was to get 'fresh' towels...by this time I was very tired and I needed sleep to get to an early conference the next day. I checked the door again and it was unlocked! A chair in front of the door and sleeping with one eye open (on what was as far as I knew unclean sheets) while listening to people having a bottle smashing competition outside is not condusive to a good nights sleep.Its a real shame as the hotel is easy to find and the staff seem very nice, if the rooms were better and the windows were double glazed this would be a far nicer place to stay.As I have no intention of going back - I don't feel like complaining as forums like this, especially if read by the Hotels in question may get things changed. Plus if people stop turning-up, they may start to question why?...the answer would be spend a night in one of the rooms for themselves!I would say on the plus side - the costs were inexpensive for the location, but there lies the catch (unlike the one on my room door)."
61,1230,May 28 2008 	Comfy Beds!	I booked this hotel as I was planning a Theatre Trip with my girlfriend and wanted to cap the night off with a hotel stay.Paid 75 for one night (from lastminute.com) which is good for the area and for a 3* hotel.The room was pretty small but as we were only there for one night it didnt bother us. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was very clean as was the rest of the room.I'd say 75 is maybe a little steep but all in all no major complaints and it is a good walking distance from the tube.Only downside was being woken by a noisy couple &quot;enjoying&quot; each others company at 7am!
62,1230,"May 27 2008	Perfect Budget Hotel	I went to Hyde Park Towers hotel with a friend in May and wasn't expecting much from what we had read online.We only wanted basic accommodation to see the sights of London.I arrived in London and expected to have to search around to find the hotel but it was right by the tube station (Bayswater) which made arrival stress free. The staff were very welcoming and always happy to help no matter what my problem. I probably pushed my luck with requests but they were always accommodating. I wasnt expecting much from the room as we only paid 241 for 3 nights split between 2 people but it was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was small but water was always hot so we didn't mind. The room included tea making facilities which were re-stocked every day by the maids so you never go without a drink. Im quite fussy with how clean my bedding is and they passed even my tests.The bed was the comfiest ive ever slept in and it was heaven to get back to after a day walking around London.The breakfast was included within the price and was the best part of our stay.It is served buffet style and had pretty much anything you could want. Loved the juices, muffins and croissants. Overall the Hotel surpassed my expectations and me and my friend would definitely go again.Its biggest plus is its location, right by Bayswater and Queensay tube which makes getting around London very easy.We bought a 3 day tube pass which cost 17 which meant we didnt have to keep buying tickets. Its bad points would be not having channel 3 in our room and the slight mumbling of the tube below but even then im just picking.Perfect budget to get around London and see the sights!!!"
63,1230,"May 15 2008 	Would definitely stay again!	Me and my sister stayed at the Hyde Park Towers for 2 nights in April after booking through Expedia. As we were on a budget I used Tripadvisor to find the best of the hotels/B&amp;Bs we could get for our money and so it came down to either staying at the Hyde Park Towers or at some badly rated B&amp;B near Kings Cross.Brilliant things about the hotel:It is literally round the corner from the tube station (Bayswater). From what I'd read I expected a few minutes walk but as we stepped out of the tube station you can literally see the back of the hotel over the road. And the other tube station (Queensway) which is on the central line could be seen just along the road from Bayswater which meant we had no trouble at all getting round London.It has quite an impressive exterior. It had seating out the front of the hotel for drinks on a warm night, or if you need a cigarette.The receptionist was very welcoming and efficient. There's a lift, which I was thankful for, being on the 3rd floor.The room was small but clean and bright and had tea making facilities.The beds and bed linen were fantastic. We both slept really well.The bathroom again was small but clean.The breakfast was exactly as described, we had toast and pastries and there seemed to be plenty of cold meats and cheese around as well as fruit. And the tea came in mugs not silly little cups!The location is fantastic. There's a Tesco Metro opposite the tube station and you can see Hyde Park from the front of the hotel.The only negative was that the shower was lukewarm. We didn't complain because it was bareable but I would have if we were staying longer.All in all it was great value for money and I wouldn't hesitate in booking there again."
64,1230,"May 7 2008 	Be careful when booking this hotel	I booked this hotel via their official web site in advance,there was a confirm e-mail back. But when I asked for some enquiries more, no reply from them.Three weeks before my booking date, I'd to change my date of stay. No one replied my e-mail so I'd to make an oversea call to the hotel because the rule is in case of cancel or change date, the customer will be charge for 1 night from credit card if didn't contact them in advance.The reservation told me that the hotel didn't work with the agency which work for their web site in booking anymore so I'd to contact that agency by myself for this. Then they gave me an e-mail.No one of that agency replied my e-mail. I'd to made an oversea call to the hotel many times about this problem but they told me to wait.One week left, I asked them for that agency's phone no. because I can't wait anymore. It's in Italy! I made 2-3 times oversea call to solve my problem.Finally, I cancel all of my booking because it seems like the hotel didn't care for the customers and let me waste the time and money. So becareful about this problem when you book this hotel!I've just backed from The UK so just have chance to post this problem. Hope these kind of problem didn't happen to anyone else!"
65,1230,"Apr 30 2008 	A very affordable place to stay overnight in London*	* provided you book online!! The prices listed at the hotel at the time we checked in were more than double the price we paid online.My partner and I stayed here for a night after a long day in London. Having read previous reviews, I was slightly apprehensive about Hyde Park Towers. However, I tried to approach it with an open mind, and I was very pleasantly surprised!The first plus point is that it is just around the corner from the tube station so it is very convenient. The hotel from outside looks very well kept and reception was welcoming. Staff were very efficient to check us in and the girl who served us seemed friendly (a nice smile) but didn't attempt to make converstation (which was fine by me - I was really tired from the day and was impatient to get to my room in order to relax).Which comes to the room: we were allocated a room on the first floor. The view outside it was... nothing - just another building on the other side and some ventilation vents. (quite expected) Also the room was rather small - just enough for a double bed and some space around it. However, they managed to fit in a table with the TV, a desk by the bed and a wardrobe. I think given its size, they did the best they could. It was pleasant and all we needed. The bed was the highlight of the room - lovely soft cotton sheets and two fluffy pillows - the perfect remedy for my tired body after a day in London.Another thing I was pleased about was the bathroom - although very small (hard to fit two people in there) it was clean and there was a another highlight that I did not expect: a bathtub!The TV was tiny and the reception was not so great but not so bad that we couldn't watch it.Although there have been comments about feeling the underground, at the floor we were on, the vibrations were minimal and nothing that we couldn't sleep through. So I managed to get a good night's sleep.As for breakfast, I don't know what people were complaining about. There was a very good continental breakfast with a good selection of pastries, bread, jam, cereal, juices, fruit salad... I was very satisfied.Check out was just like check in, quick, efficient and problem free.One point that put me off a little about the hotel was the region it was in - although the road the hotel was on looked okay, I wasn't too comfortable walking around the areas closer to the station. (but this is someone who hardly is in big cities so I am biased and possibly more cautious than most!)I think that overall, this is a good place to stay if you need to stay a night in London. However, given the size of the room, I wouldn't recommend staying here more than a few days. I think it could get quite cramped, especially if you have a suitcase.So overall, the prices are very competitive online so I would definitely recommend to people on a tight buget and just needs a bed for the night :-)"
66,1230,"Apr 29 2008 	Dirty Rooms	We stayed at the Hyde Park Towers for 3 nights. We booked an economy room, but the room was probably the most disgusting room I've ever been in. The owners should really not let anyone stay in that room unless it's been cleaned thoroughly. The carpet has stains all over it, the floor creaks loudly, the bathroom is dirty and the walls need to be repainted. Every morning we were awaken by the loud chatty maids who would talk outside our room starting at 7am. They spent most of the morning chatting in the hallway rather than cleaning which was apparent by the condition of our room. On a more positive note, the breakfast was okay to get by and the service was friendly. The location was the best part about this hotel. I would not recommend the economy rooms of this hotel to anyone. I did not see the other rooms."
67,1230,"Apr 17 2008	Lovely staff	I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel.First of all the tube station was just around the corner, although we heard the tube regularly it was fine. The tube stopped in the night.The rooms were clean and smelled good, like the floors.The breakfast fast typical continental, e.g. croissants, jams, fruits, cheese- ham, coffe etc.Delicious and warm.We had problems two times (shower- was cold + eletricity didn't worked). So I went to the reception and told them about the problems- withhin minutes it was solved.=)I would definitly recomend this hotel."
68,1230,"Mar 30 2008 	A great place where to stay	I was in London immediately before Easter and I stayed with my family at the Hyde Park Towers hotel. I have to admit that when I booked using the hotel's website I was afraid that I could have the same bad experience that I had a couple of years ago in the same area. On the contrary, when we got there we were positively impressed by both the area where the hotel is located (calm and quiet and not far from Hyde Park) and the hotel itself. While we were checking in we had a problem with our credit card but the personnel at the reception were kind and ready to help us to solve it and to make our staying there as pleasant as possible since the beginning. The room I booked was a triple and it was spacious, neat and tidy, with large beds and all the appliances that you need (hairdryer and kettle included). Albeit the bathroom was a bit narrow, in any case it was enough for the need of a family (of course don't expect to find a jacuzzi!!!). The personnel is kind and always ready to give their assistance when needed. When it comes to breakfast, it was really good and you can have whichever kind of breakfast you want: you have different kinds of pastries, several kind of cereals, as well as ham and cheese for those who like this kind of food for breakfast (in this regard I advice not to have breakfast too late in the morning as the room is not so huge and in case you go there after 8.30 a.m. you have to wait for the waiters to give you a table). The last morning we stayed there we wanted to visit the British Museum and we could leave our luggage at the reception without being asked to pay any additional fee. To cut a long story short, I advice everybody to stay in this hotel when visiting London .... I will stay there again in future!!!"
69,1230,"Mar 27 2008 	rename faulty towers	i use tripadvisor a lot and usualy way up the good and bads fairly well as i did with this hotel.but its so bad i had to wtite a review.location super.hotel terrible.breakfast was worest i have ever exp.rotten fruit,stale bread,no milk for cereal,no juice left @ 8.30am when i asked could i get some i was told NO point blank NO not their is none left or all gone just NO.when their was not enough tables @ breakfast people who were eating were told to move over so other people could sit at the table as well.that night i wanted a bottle of wine to take to the room when i asked for it to be opened i was given a cork screw to open it myself but the cork was dryed out,the girls answer was what do you want me to do.Rooms are small bathroom a box.DO'NT STAY HERE."
70,1230,"Feb 16 2008	good location and very clean	We were a little scared after reading other reveiws here and on the hotel website but.........................we were pleasantly supprised!! we were on the first floor the room looked newly decorated the beds were new and everything was spotlessly clean!! we paid 160 for a twin room for two nights which is unbeleivable!! around the corner from the subway, it was great.no problems at all."
71,1230,"Feb 8 2008 	Damp in hotel room	I booked the accommodation for 3 nights off the hotels website as this was the only way we could get the best price for a standard room. Before I booked I called the hotel to check if breakfast was included in the price and they said if we booked on there website yes it would be. On arrival the hotel looked really nice and I was surprised that the hotel was so close to Bayswater tube station a great location. I paid my bill off up front at the reception and then I was told that breakfast had not been paid for in the price, I was not too worried has there are loads of places to eat. When we got up to the room we were shocked that it didnt look like any of the pictures on the website and thought it needed a little updating but after looking around we noted that there was a big patch of damp in the corner of the room, the window frames were rotten, the radiator was loose and looked ready to fall off the wall and the bath handles were loose. Also we were unlucky to be staying on the top floor and there was some kind of generator on the roof that makes a noise 24/7 its so bad we went for a few 3am walks."
72,1230,"Jan 30 2008 	Great weekend break	I feel that this hotel has had some unfair reviews in the past. I found my stay to be enjoyable and great value for money. I stayed with my mum for two nights. Our twin room was a little on the small side, but that didn't bother us as we were out in the city most of the time. The radiator was constantly on(!) so it was lovely and warm. The reception staff were pleasant, the rooms seemed to be cleaned daily and the continental breakfast included set us up nicely for the day.The location of the hotel was perfect - it was just a street away from Bayswater tube (District and Circle lines) and a few minutes walk from Queensway (Central lines); and the surrounding area was full of cafes and restaurants - I recommend Waffle House!I've no complaints about the hotel and would gladly stay again - especially at so reasonable a price!"
73,1230,"Dec 23 2007 	Ok but not great	Typical Bayswater hotel. With an more than ok, but pricey breakfast. The reception area really highthened our expectations, but the rooms but them back in place. The bath room was absolutely freezing. All hotels in Bayswater are of course in a very good location if you like to be close to the park and reasonably close to the shopping."
74,1230,"Dec 5 2007 	Nice budget accomodation if you can get a good deal	Good and cheap accomodation in London is hard to come by, but I got a very good deal on Hyde Park Towers through hotels.com and was pleasantly surprised with the hotel.Stayed there with my boyfriend for 6 nights in August.The positives:Location is great: walk a few minutes down the road, and you are in Kensington Gardens - we LOVED this! Queensway and Bayswater tube stations are only a few minutes walk away, and with a 10 minute walk you are right at Notting Hill Gate with all the charm of Notting Hill and markets of Portobello Road just round the corner.The hotel faces a quiet tree lined street but has the rather touristy Queensway right behind it. This means a lot of people on the street at all times, many souvenir shops and restaurants.Staff were friendly. We arrived late in the evening (around 11) and were assigned a small room which the receptionist apologized deeply for. We actually didn't think it was so bad but gladly accepted a larger room the next morning. This was nice, had its own big balcony. Room was clean and functional if a little dated - but nothing in comparison to what we have experienced in London on other occasions.The negatives:The rooms were a bit dated and the elevator a little slow. The hotel must be right on top of the tube line - from our room, we could hear the subway rumbling by every 10 minutes! Obviously we were a bit concerned about this, but surprisingly none of us had any trouble sleeping. And thankfully, the trains stop running around midnight.All in all, this is a good basic hotel for budget travelers who just need a safe and convenient place to sleep and from which to explore the city - provided that you can get a good price."
75,1230,"Nov 21 2007 	Not the nicest	Been meaning to write this review for a while... I booked to stay at the Hyde Park Towers Hotel for 2 nights on behalf of myself and my colleagues this summer. Having traveled extensively and stayed in many hotels around the world, I can honestly say this one did not come up to scratch. It was very dirty, run-down, the food was not good (breakfast ok but dinner was very poor quality) and the rooms were absolutely tiny! I am only tiny myself (4 foot ten) but even I was struggling to fit in the bathroom. I asked to be moved on the first night as I had been allocated a room in the basement which was not only very noisy but didn't feel safe as the window did not lock and the room backed onto an area that could easily have been accessed from the street. Although I was moved to an upper floor room the next day, I didn't manage to get a good nights sleep the entire stay and the new room was just as worn and dirty.The only positive thing I can say about my stay is that I am extremely glad I did not pay full price - managed to get a cheap internet rate.Bottom line: Avoid if you possibly can and pay a little extra to stay elsewhere - it will be worth it."
76,1230,"Nov 10 2007 	Worst Hotel of our Europe trip	We checked in on 10/6/07, fully paid for a three nght stay months before on June 20, 2007. We very dissatisfied, and stayed there that night until we could find another hotel. They would not let us cancel or refund our money, before, after or since.They placed us on the lower 1st floor with a window right on the noisy street. We were concerned about theft, because my husband had just had his wallet, passport and credit cards stolen in Spain. They said they had no more rooms, however, in the lobby later, they continued to give other people rooms in the upper floors. The room was so small that one could get into the double bed only on one side with an 8&quot; clearance (not acceptable for our ages), the bathroom tiles covered with black fungus. Carpets were filthy, and fire alarms continued to wake us during the night. We only slept a few hours before leaving. We took pictures. Our stay stated we had breakfast included but she would not let us have it. We found a Hilton Hotel closeby and continued our London stay there the next two nights. The hotel clerk would not even give us a receipt for the three nights we paid when we check out. Many people there were dissatisfied. I would NEVER recommend this hotel. This was the end of our Europe trip having stayed in wonderful places throughout Spain, Portugal and Oxford, England."
77,1230,"Nov 7 2007 	Good location	Stayed in a triple room for 3 nights with husband and daughter, quite small but OK for a bed when you've been sight seeing all day! Room was clean, and quiet for London, until someone set the fire alarm off at 4am, and scared the living daylights out of us! (False alarm) Convinced my daughter it was a one off, but then happened again next morning as someone had burnt the toast, so needless to say didn't get much sleep! Staff were friendly enough, would stay there again for the tarriff on their website but would'nt pay much more. Good location near tubes, buses and shops."
78,1230,"Oct 30 2007 	looking worn out but value for money	I booked this hotel as a cheap overnight stay in London. I didn't expect much as it was a very competitive price, but it just about came up to expectations. The place is very old and is made up of 4 or 5 old town house knocked into one hotel. It has all the right things you expect, but this is a good example of how having the right ingredients doesn't mean you will end up with a good result.The first room we were offered was via an outside 'bridge' over the basement, then back into a VERY small ground floor corner room. I wouldn't have stayed in it just because of the location (lots of pedestrians only 5 feet away) but the double bed was literally squeezed into the room. One side had limited access, the bottom and other side had none. The second room was better. King-size bed still again one wall, but we moved a small table and pulled it more into the middle of the room. The bathroom was tiny, just about room to make a cup of tea and the 14&quot; TV was lower than the level of the bed. Worst of all there was a sickly sweet smell that I tracked down to an air freshener in the corridor outside. I moved it to another wall socket and then realised it was covering a smoky smell, but that was preferable to the sickly one! On the plus side, the room wasn't overlooked and the wardrobe space was good. We had lots of hot water, it was quiet (very distant rumble of Underground but OK on 2nd floor) and we both slept very well on the bed. It was also very good location for Hyde Park, 2 underground station and Oxford Street is a pleasant 20 mins walkOverall I wouldnt recommend it. I would rather spend 10 more and get a better room, but if you only have 65 then it was OK."
79,1230,"Oct 21 2007 	Just OK	The one thing Hyde Park Towers has going for it is the location. It is about a 1 minute walk to the Bayswater Tube Station. The rest is pretty much sub-par. Naturally the rooms were small, you will get tiny rooms anywhere in London, unless you spend LOTS of money, but our room had a slight damp odor, stained carpet, peeling wall paper, and a leaky bathroom. All in all, I don't think that the hotel was worth what we paid for it (about $200 a night). And beware if you get a room in the basement, as you can hear and feel the tube trains."
80,1230,"Oct 19 2007 	Good value (we got a good deal)	I found a good deal ($100 CDN for a double room) and decided to book online. When we arrived, they told us there was a problem and would have to give us two single rooms. I had no problem with this since I had been travelling with my mom for 5 weeks and needed some space. They included a free continental breakfast for the inconvenience.We were on the main floor, but the day we were leaving the elevator broke and people had to lug their suitcases down flights of stairs.My biggest complaint was the washrooms: Hers was unimaginably tiny. You had to crouch down and squeeze in to sit on the toilet since the sink was hanging over part of it. And I'm 5'3&quot; and under 100 lbs. There was barely any room to stand while getting out of the shower. And the water only had one temperature-burning hot.My washroom was better, as it had more room and a bathtub and normal water temperature. However, the tub was very slippery. As I was getting out, I slipped, grabbed onto the shower curtain rod for support and managed to pull it out of the wall. I have to blame that on my own klutziness. Just be careful.Overall, I can't really complain. $50 (plus tax) for a clean, relatively comfortable single room in London is a good deal. It's certainly not worth the posted rates, though."
81,1230,"Sep 22 2007 	Expensive for very basic accomodation	Needing a hotel near Paddington station for the Heathrow express, we booked a room at the Hyde Park Towers. The room can best be described as basic, taking a 50GBP pre-auth upon check in was quite optimistic - even if we had gone on a rampage it would have been impossible to incur that much cost!The room was very small, quite dirty, very noisy but the location is good. It cost us 160GBP which is about twice what it is worth, even in London."
82,1230,"Sep 15 2007 	I got a room in the basement!	I've just discovered TripAdvisor, so this review is about my stay at this hotel in 2004, oct. Since then they may have changed everything, but from reading the other reviews here, I doubt that.At the time I booked this room the hotel was said to have 4 stars, and I thought it was safe to place an order. Todays rating of 2 stars seems more accurate. Me and my wife was placed in a tiny room in the basement, overlooking the &quot;courtyard&quot;, that is, we look straight into the kitchen, which oozed of bacon and scramled eggs every morning from 5 am. The room itself was so small that it was ridiculous.There was actually not any place to lay down our big suitcase! We could tilt it standing, but had to lay onto the small (queen-size?) bed if we wanted to retrieve something from it. I had to remove a large fan from the floor and put it on top of a locker to get at least some space to move around the bed. But even then I would have to climb over my wife to get into my place in the bed. I even calculated the available floor space not occupied by desk, locker, fan, bed and door-swing. The available area was 1.5 square metres! For two persons. The bathroom was exactly the same as the ones you will find in a third class ship cabin: sooo small.We had orderd a non-smoking room, but the room was equipped with an ash tray, and the smell was undeniable. The safe was there, but not working. The tv didn't work either, but we was not in London to see tv so that didn't bother us too much.I was extremely disappointed to be offered this small room in the basement. It couldn't be any worse anywhere in London.We complained and was moved to another room on the 3th floor. This was decent, but not large or fancy or anything. The bathroom even had a bathtube, but still not very large. When I sat down on the toilet, my hips touch from wall to bathtube, and I'm not that fat! (ok, I could take off 10 kgs:).The staff was friendly enough, but the basement rooms should be sealed off and never offered any paying customer!!"
83,1230,"Sep 6 2007	Unfortunate Experience	Im not sure whether my experience at the Hyde Park Towers was a one-off or just a bit of bad luck?. I made a late internet booking for the hotel only a few hours beforehand and when I had arrived the confirmation had not been faxed through to the hotel (I had maintained a copy of the confirmation email in my inbox). The poor girl on the reception was unable to verify my booking and as there were no available rooms left (singles) so she had to resort to giving me a few options - none of which I was pleased with. Either I pay for an upgrade to a double or go find another hotel. (I was furious!). I didn't expect this level of service after having a room confirmed via the internet. She later confirmed that I did have a booking and allocated me a dodgy room in the basement level. Unfortunately this left me with a negative impression of the hotel - I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. (Its like booking a flight over the internet and rolling up to the airport to find you don't have a seat allocation because the airline can't verify your booking due to a delay in the fax - sorry, its not good enough).Get your booking system together Hyde Park Towers."
84,1230,"Aug 15 2007 	A loud place with tiny room	Since every hotel in London is expensive, the best I could get for location and price was the Hyde Park Towers Hotel. Location wise, it is good. It is nearby two Underground stations, and across from Kensington Gardens. There are a number of restaurants, cafes, and fast food places a block away. The hotel itself is strangely laid out. There are stairs within the same levels, and rooms connected by little doored 'foyers'. Because of this, my room was directly across from another room by arm's reach. I could hear whenever those people came and went, and even snores. My room was really small, and I kept bumping into things. The heavier blankets were not clean and smelled really bad. The extra blanket in the closet didn't smell much better, so I just used one sheet blanket and slept in a long-sleeved shirt to stay warm. The bathroom was clean and simple. The noise from the street was very loud until 3am, then the morning work traffic would start at around 6am."
85,1230,"Jul 19 2007 	let down by the room	spent two nights at hotel on 9th july.staff very friendly and helpful.location good, bayswater and queensway tube nearby and kensington gardens at top of road .size and condition of room not great and noise from tube.overall ok for price."
86,1230,"Jul 19 2007 	Smiles Better than the rest	I have posted about this hotel before, and as I have just stayed again last night thought I would do a follow up.This hotel is clearly smiles better than the rest, and the reasons why are that must be the friendliest, happiest, hotel I have ever stayed in. All the staff here are just blinding. Elisa, Jelena, Chris, and Paul just always seemed to go out thier way to help me. For me service has to be the most important thing in any hotel and this wins every time. Service with a smail, people who know what they are doing, it just makes the stay all the better.The room I stayed in this time, 112 was better than my last stay, the restaurant has just been done up, the garden area is really good, especially for me as a smoker, breakfast is vast and with lots of choice, the internet even works in the garden, but for all the good stuff, the best thing about the hotel is the staff and they are just smiles better."
87,1230,"Jul 8 2007 	What a wonderful surprise!	I recently stayed at the Hyde Park Towers Hotel in Bayswater, London, while I was in the city on business. What a wonderful surprise. I normally stay at well-known chain hotels but this time my assistant booked me in to this independent hotel. I was dubious. But I had no reason to be. I found my stay excellent. Firstly the staff were warm and friendly. They seemed to genuinely care that I had a good stay at the hotel and were keen to help me find my way around the city. One night I ate at the hotel and found their pizza delicious. Just as good as anything I can get at home. My bed was extrememly comfortable and the room was quiet and well served by wireless internet. I was also impressed by the hotel's efforts towards being more environmentally friendly. As I travel a lot on business this is something that concerns me. It is good to see the hotel industry taking it seriously. I would highly recommend the Hyde Park Towers to anyone whether travelling on business or for pleasure."
88,1230,"Jul 4 2007 	Very small hotel	We stayed in this hotel over Thanksgiving in 2006. Entire trip was purchased through Virgin Atlantic. This hotel is so small that if you want to change your mind you have to go outside. Room was 8'x8' with no room for cloths so we had to keep everything in our suitcases. Bathroom clean but very small too. You have to remember that you are in Europe and everything here is small comparing to US. No extra soap provided even if you ask, so bring your own if you need more. We did not mind conditions because we spent entire day outside. Hotel room is only to have a place to sleep. So it was OK deal for the money although this was the smallest room I had ever stayed in Europe. So, do not expect spacious rooms."
89,1230,"Jun 29 2007	Great value for money and location	I stayed here with a friend for one night for 49. The staff were extremely polite and helpful and our room was basic but clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location, 1 min from bayswater tube and a great base for exploring london. For 49 a room it is great value for money. Our buffet style continental breakfast was included as well!!"
90,1230,"Jun 20 2007 	Below Average	I stayed at this hotel for one night on 16th June.I booked a twin room but on checking in there was a note on top of the piece of paper I signed to signify my arrival. &quot;Free upgrade to family room&quot;. Well that was good news.Upon getting into the room I discovered it was not a family room nor a twin room. We had a double bed. Wonderful. Luckily the double bed is just two twins pushed together so we managed to break them apart but that's not really the point. I had better things to do with my time.The room was rather small. The TV was rather big and had sky news and CNN along with with the 5 usual terestrial channels. The decor was shabby. It had clearly recently been painted but to a poor standard. The desk's seat was filthy. Goodness knows what all the stains were!The bathroom was a reasonable size and was quite clean apart from patches of mold on the ceiling. There was a bath and a shower.Even though we were on the second floor we could still hear and feel tube trains travelling underneath the hotel. I can only imagine how bad that must be if you're staying on the ground or 1st floor!The bar was small (a dozen seats and half a dozen tables) and overpriced. From memory a Smirnoff Ice cost 3, a small bottle of Guiness cost 3 and a very small bottle of coke (200ml) cost 1.40. But it was still open come 2am in the morning so that was quite handy.I saw two computers for Internet access. One in the lobby and one in the bar. 1 for 30 minutes use.As i'd booked online from a last minute deal type website I paid for the room only so I did not get the chance to sample the breakfast menu. Breakfast costs 6.95 which seems reasonable.The location is by far and away the best feature of this hotel. Bayswater tube is 1 minute away and Hyde Park is just at the top of the road."
91,1230,"Jun 17 2007 	excellent value	stayed here as a single traveller in January 2007. Having only paid 150 with Ryanairhotels.com for three nights, I was expecting something very basic, however I was pleasantly surprised to get a room adequately spacious for one person and very comfortable. My room was well equipped with a bathroom, tea/coffee facilities and a television, and the hotel's location was second to none, with Hyde Park at the end of the street, and numerous shops, restaurants and bars, as well as two Underground stations in the street running parallel to Inverness terrace.The hotel staff were very pleasant and check-in took less than two minutes. The downstairs bar was comfortable and not overpriced as in many London hotels. My booking included breakfast, which was served in buffet style, in a breakfast area overlooking the street outside.Overall this is an excellent choice for its location, price and comfort, however if you expect a view from your window, avoid a lower ground floor (basement) room."
92,1230,Jun 1 2007 	Great Hotel	We stayed in 3 rooms for 2 nights in May 2007. The staff were brilliant and the hotel itself was really handy to bayswater tube station. The continental breakfast had something for everyone. The rooms themselves could do with a bit of updating and they are very small but had everything you need in central London. Steer clear of the big sit in chinese around the corner though - the staff are crazy !!!
93,1230,"May 21 2007	Nice neighbourhood and location	Nice and clean but small rooms.Good service from the staff and nice breaky.Appealing building and quiet area next to a bussy one (Queensway). Shops, restaurants, pubs and cinema just around the corner. But the best of all is the location really just next to the tube."
94,1230,"May 18 2007 	Georgians pleased with Hyde Park Towers	My husband and I spent 8 days at the Hyde Park Towers in early March and had a very pleasant experience there. We had felt some apprehension due to a few bad reviews we'd read in the months prior to our trip but were very pleased with most aspects of the hotel and the service we received. Obviously, this is a budget hotel and anyone expecting luxury will be disappointed, but overall we found our accommodations to be very comfortable, clean and pleasant and the staff to be friendly, considerate and eager to meet our needs. The hotel could benefit from modernization, but this, we felt, was a minor consideration. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone seeking comfort, security, location and a friendly atmosphere at a reasonable price."
95,1230,May 5 2007 	Not fit for rats	I woul not reccomend this place to anyone im sure homeless people would turn it down if they were offered a bed here. They messed up the rooms from what was requested. The rooms are horrible really old and nasty. The bar is a tiny overpriced mess and thats all I can say really cause it is bringing back bad memories. Stay well away there is too many hotels in london so no need to get stuck here.
96,1230,Apr 29 2007	Lovely friendly staff great location and fantastic value	We stayed at this hotel for a period of two weeks and found this hotel to be in a great location very close to Queensway which is just around the corner with loads of restaurants and souvenir shops. The staff are extremely friendly and nothing is a problem. Rooms are small but clean which is a must for anyone. I would definitely stay there again in the future.
97,1230,"Apr 15 2007 	You won't go wrong staying at Hyde Park Towers	I feel that Hyde Park Towers is a very good deal in London, where hotels are often expensive for less than ideal accommodations. It is in a nice neighborhood and conveniently located near public transportation, shopping and restaurants. The front desk was very efficient and helpful all the time, but especially when I registered. I had requested a twin bedded room for myself and cousin and when none was available, we were provided with two single rooms at no extra charge. We both appreciated the hotel's flexibility. The rooms were clean, though admittedly small.. When one member of my group requested a new shower curtain, it was promptly provided. Breakfasts were generous, with a good selection of food. I would definitely recommend staying at Hyde Park Towers when in London ."
98,1230,"Apr 10 2007 	Convenient	Great hotel located within one block walking of the Queensway and Bayswater Underground stops. Queensway is a busy street with small shops, lots of restaurants and people activity. Hotels' location is also one block from the north side of Hyde Park in a very lovely section of London. Hotel lobby is standard and rooms are small but quite adequate. Bathrooms also are small but OK. Front desk personel very cooperative. Breakfast included in room rate and quite good. Very pleased with our three night stay.Would recommend to anyone. Very convenient for those that wish to use underground/bus travel throughout London or who like to walk to the sites(we walked to Marble Arch &amp; Oxford Street which is about a mile away."
99,1230,"Apr 7 2007	Give it a go	I have stayed here 5 or 6 times in the past and have to say I am surprised by the tone of many of the reviews here. First the negatives: The rooms could do with some modernisation but they are neat and tidy and clean. The carpets could do with replacing but again they shouldn't put you off. If you are a light sleeper (I am not) then the fact that the Tube goes underneath the hotel may annoy you if you are on the bottom floor. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. I have always found them to be really helpful and friendly. I work a lot in London and you can't over emphasise how important that is. Rooms have TV with 5 channels plus CNN with a remote and good reception. I am 6 foot but have never had a bathroom here which I would say was too small to be comfortable. There's a bar, restaurant, 24 hour reception and cheap internet access (1 for 30 mins). The breakfast (7am start) is good: the usual plus boiled eggs, fruit &amp; yoghurt.Bayswater is the best place in London to stay: this hotel is a 2 mins. walk from tube stations, and every type of shop, restaurant, cinema, bar etc. you could want.If you book through their website rather than lastminute you can usually get a single room for less than 50 quid a night. I've paid 40 before, and I can't find any better than that in central London... If you are a budget traveller you really shouldn't be put off staying here."
100,1230,"Apr 5 2007 	Don't stop here - keep looking	There HAVE to be better places in this price range. (We booked way late and didn't have time to shop around - our fault.) Really tired carpets and furniture. We were given a &quot;family&quot; room with a foldout couch, folded out for us. But as a twosome, we wanted to fold it up so we'd have room for our luggage. No can do - there's a board under the mattress. We asked if someone could help out. Nope, after check in time there's no one around to assist. We managed to extricate the plywood sheet to find that the couch didn't fold up anyway. Nice touch.But if you must stay here, you'll find it's VERY close to the Baywater tube station as well as coffee shops (Starbucks, etc.) and other quick eateries. The room is not microscopic as many London hotels are. The sheets were clean and crisp cotton, not pill-ed polyester. And the bell person was quite helpful when checking our bags since there was no way we could check in before 3:00 pm -room not ready until at least then."
101,1230,"Mar 25 2007 	Dowdy bare carpets good service avoid the dungeon	I stayed there for 5 days in early December, 2006. The Towers are 3 floors high. The bottom floor is a dungeon. If you like claustrophobia, youll love the basement.Carpets are threadbare. Internet works in the upper floors. Great location and neighborhood. Friendly staff, good breakfast. Stay only if you have nowhere else."
102,1230,"Mar 21 2007 	CHeap and Cheerful	Booked for two night stay while working in London. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room and bathroom small but ok. Great location, near tube with plenty of shops and decent restaurants nearby. Good value place to crash if you're just looking for a base but not particularly recomended if you are going to spend a lot of time in your room."
103,1230,"Mar 12 2007 	Avoid the Ground Floor	Beware of being given a room on the ground floor. You will not be able to sleep past about 6.00am, time of the first underground train on the circle/district line from adjacent Bayswater station.The train travels directly under the hotel and my room shook like it was being hit by an earthquake every few minutes."
104,1230,"Mar 11 2007 	Good Location	Hi just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel.First of all, the hotel is very easy to find. Minutes from the tube station. Its in a great location. Bayswater is not bad.....there is a shopping centre close by with a cinema if u prefer not to travel far.Walking into the hotel's lobby you feel like this is a great hotel.Great lobby. Checking in was smooth and the staff was very friendly.We stayed in a twin room, (2 single beds). The room was clean and basic. I wouldn't say it was TINY as some other reviews but it was a good size. Two cases would fit easily and still have space to move around.There were tea/coffee making facilities and the TV had a remote. Smile. Usual channels and couple other news channelsThe bathroom was also very clean and there were the usual soap/shampoo and shower gel.Although the room was clean, one could tell that its been a while since it was last refurbished as it looked old, not tattered but worn.The heating worked and I was pleasantly suprised to say it was one of the most comfortable beds I have been in. Usually you expect to feel the springs, but not in this hotel. The mattress must have been new.We were on the 2nd floor and couldn't hear the underground trains running. I did hear them however when I was in the lobby. I could only imagine how bad it would be if u slept on the floor below the lobby.Our room faced the road, we stayed on the weekend and on friday night u can hear the traffic, but not loud enough to keep u awake. On saturday it was much quiter.Breakfast was continental, included in our package. But if u wanted a cooked breakfast u can order one but u have to pay 7.00.Continental breakfast buffet was plentiful but the usual cereals,toast, fruits etc, but there were boiled eggs and the staff kept restocking as soon as anything went low. I thought that on some mornings it can get a bit cramped as there were lack of space, but if u waited a couple minutes a table wii be available.All in all I would say that I had a pleasant stay in this hotel.I got a great online deal for two nights with breakfast.If I got this deal again, I would be happy to stay here again."
105,1230,"Mar 5 2007 	A very good deal	For 50 GBP I was not expecting much (I'd been to other London hotels before). But this one was a nice surprise.The room was not big (a single bed) but it was clean and the hotel seemed well maintained - the other rooms seemed well looked after too (I looked in when the cleaners were there). The shower was clean and there was no sign of any mould.The hotel was quite smart, with a nice bar and a spacious entrance.It is very well located: just around the corner from Bayswater underground and 200 m from Hyde Park.I did not have breakfast. I spent one night there, so the small room (60 cm from the edge of the bed to the desk) was not a problem."
106,1230,"Mar 4 2007	Spacious Rooms Good quality furnishings and an excellent location	I'm a regular business traveller to London, and I like to look for good value 3 star hotels that offer comfort, amenities at an affordable price, and the Hyde Park Towers Hotel certainly offers all three.Tastefully furnished spacious single rooms, cable TV, Tea and Coffee, Bath and shower, modern clean rooms and wireless internet at 45.00 per night through lastminute.com make this hotel an excellent choice.Not really sure why it has courted such bad reviews. I've certainly stayed at an awful lot worse, and I was pleasantly surprised when I stayed here.Overall, a good solid choice in an excellent location."
107,1230,"Feb 18 2007 	Location Location Location	For 100 US dollars a night I doubt you could have found better in London. Before I went I read all the reviews and I have to admit I was practically terrified of what I'd find (I'm not the one who booked the hotel) but I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't bad at all!Our room was small, and a bit worn, but definitely clean and not so tiny that it was uncomfortable. The bathroom was also small but clean. We were on the second floor, facing the street, and that allowed for us to keep the window open when our room got stuffy.I did not feel the entire hotel shake as other reviewers have mentioned, but when I was in the lobby using the Internet (a great deal of a pound for 30 minutes) I would feel like my chair vibrated a bit occasionally.The main draw of this hotel is exactly what I mentioned in the title of my review, the location is AMAZING. Being in such close proximity to the Bayswater Tube Station made it incredibly convenient to travel around, and on Queensway Rd. was some of the best food I've ever had in my life. I would venture to say there were atleast 10 different ethnicities, and I would recommend trying both Bella Italia, and Bedoin (Moroccan) as they were both superb.One last tip, book online! The rates posted in the lobby were 139 pounds (248 dollars with the exchange rate we were dealing with) for the room we had booked for only 100 dollars a night."
108,1230,"Feb 7 2007 	OK hotel good breakfast	Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Hyde Park Towers for a weekend in February of 2007. The reservation was made via a Swedish travel agent offering packages for city weekends. We booked the Hyde Park Towers since the presentation from the travel agent looked good and the price was quite low. However, you get what you pay for!!!Check-in was fast and efficient (although I dislike when hotel staff try to sell me sightseeing deals or other tourist stuff unless I specifically ask for it - in this case a hop-on hop-off bus and boat sightseeing deal). As we arrived at noon we had to wait until 14.30 when the room should be ready the receptionist said.We returned at 18.00 got room # 125. After finding our way up there (through a smelly elevator, a narrow corridor and an even narrower separate staircase up to the room) we found out the room was not cleaned! There were trash laying around all over the room.After carrying the bags down again the front desk quickly changed our room to # 55. The room was small (New York size) and clean. It had tea and coffee making facilities but no refrigerator. The springs in the bed were worn out. The TV was tiny and had regular channels to choose from. The bathroom was really tiny but nothing to complain about - good hot water in the shower. The view out of the windows was a brick wall.The big setbacks with the room were an air-conditioning unit outside the window making a rather high humming noise 24/7 and the subway. The subway seemed to go directly under the room, which shook for 10 seconds every 10 minutes or so. You get used to it though. However, I'd suggest that you get a room as high up as possible.Breakfast was surprisingly good. A lot to choose from, although nothing out of the ordinary.Check-out was as smooth as check-in. No hassle. The hotel does not charge for keeping your luggage in the luggage room, which I find really good.The best with the hotel is the location. Not even a minute's walk to Bayswater subway. 2-3 minutes walk to Queensway subway, Bayswater Road (with a lot of busses) and Hyde park. Thus you can easily go with the subway to Heathrow (Around 50 minutes with 1 change at Earl's Court), Oxford Circus or Kensington, or wherever your destination is. I prefer going by bus as you see more then.I felt safe in the neighbourhoods around the hotel and there were a lot of good resturants and pubs between Bayswater and Queensway subwaystations. I recommend Kam Tang, which is a really good an genuine Chinese restaurant.I recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean, safe and decent hotel with a good location."
109,1230,"Jan 24 2007 	Good value!	Since I had read both very positive and very negative reviews about the Hyde Park Towers I was curious to see what it was really like. I was positively surprised and found nothing wrong with it at all, no sound our shakings from the underground or any other disturbances. We stayed on the second floor, and it might be that the rooms on different floors are different. Our room was small, but sufficient. The beds were comfortable, there was a coffe/tea maker and a hair dryer. The bathroom was small but clean. The breakfast buffet was nice with bread, eggs, ham, cheese, cereals, juices, coffe/tea and fresh fruit. The staff were polite and helpful. We were given tickets for each bag that we stored in the luggage room so no one but ourselves could claim them. I would not hesitate to stay here again, especially not for the bargain price (GBP 50) we got during low season."
110,1230,"Jan 22 2007	I did not like this hotel	This hotel is close to being not fit for humans. I did read rewiews saying it was bad but I thought it could not be as bad as people was describing. The only good thing was that after I got a room that was in the basement I talked to them about transfering to another room, and they gave me a better room on the 3. floor. The halls are smelly and sometimes you sunk down when you ware walking. Would not reccomend this to anyone.But probably most of the hotels in the same price range are not good quality!!!"
111,1230,"Jan 17 2007 	Location Location Location	Myself and boyfriend stayed in Hyde Park Towers from 12th Jan - 14th Jan. The hotel has an excellent location, just around the corner from Bayswater tube station. We flew into Gatwick, got the Gatwick express train from the airport to Victoria station, changed at victoria station for Bayswater station. It really wasn't that much hassle. The journey took us approximately 50 mins from Gatwick Airport. Check in was quick and efficient. We stayed in room 214, it had a queen size bed and a single bed. The rooms are TINY but I think because of the extra bed we had more room than some other reviewers to put our luggage etc. The bathroom is VERY small and only room for one person at a time!! The room was clean and confortable. We didn't notice the noise from the tubes going underneath at all. The street around the corner from the hotel has loads of bars and restaurants. We arrived late on Friday night, around 11pm and were delighted to find some restaurants still open (an Italian just beside the tube station called Bella Italia) - Lovely food! The main advantage of this hotel is its location. It is in a lovely area and I felt very safe walking around late at night. To make the most of the location of this hotel you really do need to use the tube system though. We got a taxi home from Oxford Street after a hard days shopping and it cost approx 11 sterling. Faults:-On our first morning we were rudely awoken to the fire alarm going off at 7am! The hotel's evacuation procedure seemed lacking. After getting up and evacuating our room, we had trouble finding the emergency exit and then halfway out the alarm stopped. Not once in all of the comotion was there any sign of a hotel employee assisting guests. There was total confusion. We eventually found our way to reception and had to ask was everything ok, the receptionist hadn't moved from her desk and there was nobody in the lobby to give information. On our way back up to the room, we had to inform other guests that everything was ok. I would hate to see if there was a real emergency in the hotel."
112,1230,Jan 16 2007 	AWFUL AWFUL AWFULsleeping on the street would be better	If I could minus the rating - I would.I wanted to treat myself and stay in a nice london hotel. I should have chosen somewhere else.My twin room was reduced to a single as they saw I was &quot;single&quot; and said they suddenly had none available. I was put in the tiniest room in the world. I could touch all walls by spreading my arms. The bathroom was tiny - with no bath but a floor shower. I had to keep the door open otherwise I would have got claustrophobia.At night there was a very loud clanking noise of the lift going up and down - so no sleep was allowed in my box of a roomI complained since I had paid for a twin and had an awful time and was told I would get a 25% refund put back on my card.I have yet to see this refund.Do not under any circumstances stay here.I would have got more sleep on the street.
113,1230,"Jan 3 2007 	Great Stay	Reception was great check-in was fast and the receptionist was very helpful. The reception is open 24 hours so they accept late check in. We stayed over new year for 2 nights. The hotel does also offer conferencing facilites, a bar and restaurnt. Although we did not eat or drink in either every time we went past there were people in them. I originally booked the room on what i though was a room only basis only to find when i arrived we also had a continental breakfast included in the price (but we did not make use of this).The room was an ok size if you don't have much luggage otherwise it could be very cramped. The room had tea and coffee making facilities, tv and was cleaned daily by the staff.The bathroom was extremely small although it had a good size bath and shower in. The toilet was right opposite the sink and when you stood up from the loo you didn't have to move to wash your hands. They provided you with fresh towels and a bath mat every day if so required otherwise they ask you to use them as long as possible to help on enviromental costs with washing and things. They also supplied soap, shampoo and shower gel.The hotel is in a excellent location being a matter of seconds away from Bayswater Station. The main highstreet of bayswater is one street along and has many shops, pubs and restaurnts.The tube does run straight under the hotel, but we were staying on the 3rd floor so i did not here this and it did not effect my sleep. Overall the stay was fantastic and i would gladly use the hotel again although if i were to go with some one else again i would ask for a larger room."
114,1230,"Dec 16 2006	convenient hotel	OK Hotel, single room#316 ,toilet tiny, bath which you would have to lay sideways in ,shower curtain with a 45% bend so you had a cold curtain clinging to you all the time,but then again, you should have seen the size of the room and bathroom in #57, which they tried to put me in, one legged people only, cause there aint room for both, the best thing is the location, 50M, from Bayswater tube, 200M to Queensway tube, by the way, if you get seasick easily then dont stay here, I was on the 3rd floor and the building swayed as the trains passed under, I swear/, I was offerred a cooked breakfast for 6.95, go round the corner and choose from 25 differant cafes from 2.95, same with the so called bar ,in 4 nights I did not see a soul in there, youll understand when you see their (cheap London prices), the bar on the corner left of Bays water tube is exellent, good food, good prices, great and friendly staff,"
115,1230,"Dec 11 2006 	Terrible	First it boasted free internet but once the credit on the managers card went low they refused to get it up online again.Was fo frustrating to be without the internet but they gave the excuse that it was upgrading.Next the rooms were very cramp and unfriendly for luggagesEach floor splits into another floor eg u can take the lif to the 2nd floor but u got to get stairs to floors 1.5 or 2.5 and if you are carrying luggages,look out.Next was the metro travels under the hotel.You can FEEL and hear the train as it goes past so it does disturb the stay.Other then that it is near the Bayswater area and looks better then some other hostals next to it.For me it still is a no-no i paid appx $100usd+++ for a nights stay."
116,1230,"Dec 7 2006 	Small but good quality with a discounted rate only	My husband and I needed a place to stay for a one night getaway in London. I have previously used [----] but am finding that its quality of service is diminishing. My main problem is that although the website states that there are rooms available, THREE TIMES I have been told that there was no availability and that they needed to find a replacement. The replacement hotels are usually not similar (based on reviews) to the one I initially book. Anyway it is a hassle to have to wait 2-3 days to see if the hotel accepts my booking. I used [----] for this booking and it went very well. We paid 59pounds for a one night stay for a double bedroom (without breakfast). The website only asks for your credit card information to hold the booking and we paid the full amount at the end of our stay at the hotel. We had a ground floor room which was fine. It WAS a tiny room, room enough for just 2 people sitting on the bed and watching TV, and 1-2 small bags. Think of a large walk-in closet and that is what we stayed in. The bathroom seemed bigger than the room itself. There was room to walk back and forth in and out of the bathroom. The room was clean, (including clean sheets and towels). The linens were pretty updated (I noticed a small stain on a towel, but it smelled washed). The TV set was TINY, but we weren't there to watch TV. The tub was a medium to small size but the shower curtain ROD ran along a bit too short, so if you shut the shower curtain all the way, you'd only have half of the tub to use. We just didn't shut the shower curtain all the way and we were fine, nothing got wet. Good updated faucets, good pressure in shower. It looks like they managed to update their sink faucet by combining the 2 spouts into 1, but I noticed they haven't quite got it perfected as I saw 2 different streams of water pouring out (one hot one cold) but out of one pipe. This didn't matter to us though, because you could wash your hands and face easily(just wait a couple seconds to let the 2 streams of water mix). They did not provide wash cloths which was a personal preference for my husband. Their shampoos were in small packets that you had to squeeze (so if you need lots of shampoo, bring your own), but they provide soap for the sink and the tub. They had a towel for the floor as well. I thought they did a great job with the space they had. They even had a nice size closet and desk with chair. We DID hear the subway train drive by every once in a while, but since we were back in at the hotel late at night we didn't hear it (and feel the rumbling) too often (I think the train stops running at a certain time). Neither myself nor my husband are light sleepers so it didn't bother our sleep. I'm not sure if you still hear and feel the train go by if you are on a higher floor. The location is the BEST part of this hotel. It is a block away from tons of shops, restaurants (all types, ethnic, etc), 2 underground stations. The area itself is very cute and quiet (in a small neighborhood). We would definitely come back here but only at a discounted rate. We saw that their regular rate was about 160pounds for a double room. Perhaps they reserve the ground floor rooms for the discounted rated rooms and the better/bigger rooms are upstairs??? There's no way I'd pay that much for the room we had. Reception at night was very friendly. The reception lady during the day seemed a bit moody that morning (Dec 2, 2006). Overall, good quality for what we paid."
117,1230,"Nov 8 2006 	Great Location rooms seriously tiny very noisy	Booked hotel through website. Got great price for room compared to price they were charging if you hadn't booked through net.Location is brilliant right beside Bayswater station.Great shops and restaurants on street adjacent.Room...no joking was TINY was on ground level floor twin room. Bathroom literally no room to move once your standing in it thats all the room there is.Couldn't get any coldwater from the shower (usually other way around) had boiling hot water- couldn't take a shower!Our room was a bit noisy as pipes were outside our window which we couln't open, no view - it was a wall!Breakfast grand- fruit, yougarts, toast., cereal, what more would you want!Staff lovely, dont know if i'd stay there again but wouldn't mind if I had to!"
118,1230,"Oct 30 2006 	Good Location	Good Location. Stayed from 21-23.10.2006 and 26-28.10.2006. Check-in was fast. Room for the first time was a twin room in the basement with two single beds placed opposite each other. The second time was a room at the third floor with 2 single beds placed together. Both were clean and the beds were new so they were comfortable. Staff were quite helpful. Bathroom was small with a bathtub. Coffee making facilities were available. The hotel is located near 2 tube stations i.e. Bayswater ( 2 minutes walk) and Queensway (4 minutes walk). There are many restaurants nearby, The Four Seasons (duck rice), Suki (Japanese), Lebanese, Italian restaurants. Tesco and Boots are also nearby. Would consider staying here in the future for the location."
119,1230,"Oct 25 2006 	Loved London not crazy about the hotel	First off, the staff at the Hotel was great. Very pleasant, helpful. Always ready to help. The room, well lets say don't try to stretch. Small is not the right word. The room was clean, but with two people there was no room. Suitcases had to be moved around, just to move around. Beds, were lumpy and worn out. They could use something on the walls to make it more attractive. There were larger rooms in the Hotel, but none were available. The photos in their web site are of the larger rooms. I realize the rooms in London or Europe are smaller then in the U.S. but this was ridiculous. The area, we thought was perfect. Quiet neighborhood, the next street over had lots of restaurants and shops. There are two different tube stops on the next street. And of course Hyde park is very very close. Can't really recommend this Hotel, unless you get the larger rooms. Not too sure how many there are. Ratings, I give it a 2 out of 5"
120,1230,"Oct 18 2006 	Much nicer than expected	After reading numerous negative reviews of this hotel (after we booked reservation) I was quite concerned about what awaited us. My concerns were quickly put to rest upon check-in. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. My travel companion and I are both smokers, so we were given a room on the lowest level.....next to the maid supply room. As we spent all of our time exploring London, this was not a problem. Breakfast was a lovely buffet, everything one could want. Items were constantly replenished.As to the room......yes, it was small. But perfectly adequate for 2 persons. Cleaned each day. Bathroom smaller than we are used to at Amercian chains. But again......who cares! We were there to see London, not a bathroom. No bed bugs, or any bugs at all in our room. We kept our window open at night....slight noise from tube,but again not worth all the negative comments I had read. No rumbling or shaking of room at all. Location could not be better. Half a block from Underground entry,so close to lovely Hyde Park, felt totally safe walking in area. Tesco close by for snacks.I would stay here again without reservation. Excellent value with the exchange rate in UK poor for US travellers. Dont spend a fortune on room when everything else is so pricey!"
121,1230,"Oct 18 2006 	Great Location	Very pleased with Hyde Park Towers. From reading other reviews, it appears the location of the room makes all the difference. We had a street-facing room with large window which was light and airy. Breakfast was above the norm for English hotels. Comprehensive continental breakfast with plenty of fruit and savouries. Very helpful staff and proximity to 2 tube stations means we'll use this hotel again."
122,1230,"Oct 15 2006	Revolting	The only good thing I found about this hotel was the location and the hotel staff were friendly. Other than that, not that great. The room was tiny and I could barely fit my suitcase through the door. The bathroom was also tiny. Not only was the room small, I got bitten by bed bugs and my ankles were revolting. The only good thing about this was that my face was not bitten. Just the thought makes me feel ill."
123,1230,"Oct 11 2006 	Great Location Great Value	I stayed one night and booked my stay ahead of time from the U.S. through a popular website. I got a VERY good price, so didn't have high expectations.The hotel lobby was nice. The room itself was the typical minature single room. Like others I had similar problems with the water. I could get hot water, but not much, so if added too much cold water to get a real stream, the water temperature would be too low. If I were staying more than one night I would have complained and asked to be moved to another room.The staff was very friendly. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is SO close to the Bayswater tube stop AND across from the tube stop is a Tesco metro, so I could buy food for cheap (which is good since the exchange rate for the dollar was about $2 for 1 pound sterling!)The neighborhood is clean and safe and full of great cheap restaurants and cyber cafes.Assuming you get a low price, this is a great value. If I had paid more I would have been disappointed in the room and shower issues."
124,1230,"Oct 11 2006 	Stuffy in London!	We booked this hotel through [--] and we sure were glad we did! We paid 69 GBP a night, and when we got there they were charging 160 GBP for the same room! I think they gave us a subpar room to make up for our savings though! The room we were in had no window, or air, and while it wasn't overly hot, the air was so stuffy! And the walls were so thin! In the morning, the maids could be heard loud and clear screaming to eachother from the rooms. I actually called and complaned about them one day, because I thought it was a famiy! It was as clean as I could expect, and for 69 GBP, a steal-ours included a breakfast too, which wasn't bad. Overall, if your budget traveling, and are just looking for a clean place to sleep that is near the underground, and right next to Hyde Park, I would reccomend this hotel."
125,1230,"Aug 26 2006 	Just OK	My mum (68) and I (36) stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Aug. (a few weeks ago) and we would stay again. But dont expect a 3 stars hotel, it deserves 2 onlyWell, my first impression was shocking: We booked our stay through a travel agency and so we shouldnt pay again at the hotel. When we arrived, the lady in reception asked me to give her my credit card details (LOL) just in case we were going to use the telephone, meals, etc I told her that I didnt see the point of giving her my CC details in advanced; we would pay our expenses at the checking out as usual. Then she didnt insist anymore.We booked a twin room and we asked if it would be a problem to stay in 2 single rooms (that was perfect for us, no complaint at all) :-)The staff was warm and friendly. There were free newspapers and magazines in reception everyday (complimentary) Breakfast was nice: continental, fruit, yogurts, cheese, ham, cereals, toasts, orange&amp; grapefruit juice, coffee, tea and the staff was replacing the food &amp; drinks all the time.Some the chairs at the breakfast room were asking for being replaced ASAP too ;-)The rooms were clean and big enough, but very warm (there is not air conditioner or fans) They definitely need new carpets, curtains and throws. -Even the carpet in the ground floor, next to the lifts, was plenty of hols- Excellent location! The tube station (Bayswater) and restaurants, shops, etc just around the corner!Over all: EXCELLENT VALUE AND LOCATION! Definitely we would stay again (but maybe not in summer as the rooms were very hot)"
126,1230,"Jul 30 2006 	Worst Hotel EVER!	This hotel was one of the worst we have ever stayed in! We hadn't intended to stay here but a last minute mixup at our original hotel, meant we had to find a different reservation.While the staff was relatively friendly, the room was tiny, dingy, unkempt and unbearably hot. We were told that the room would sleep three people comfortably, but it was hardly big enough for a single person.In addition to the size and condition of the room, the tube (english public transit system) travelled right beneath the hotel, which meant it was consistently noisy and the walls shook.We would not recommend this hotel for any traveller. Other than our time at this hotel, we had a great vacation in the UK."
127,1230,"Jul 26 2006 	Wouldn't recommend	Having stayed there for one night on a business trip, I would not recommend this hotel, I stayed in a single room (No.117) which was tiny it had a small window which looked out onto...nothing, ventilation was non existent (it was during the heat wave),and I got virtually no sleep, the hotel was also noisy.Anybody with a large frame simply would not have squeezed between the bath and the sink! The water was cold, which in the heat was irrelevant.I opted for the breakfast (unbelievably not included in the price of 120 p/n), this was the worst breakfast I have had in a hotel, the milk had skin on top! There was limited choice, and the service poor.The reason we booked this hotel was that there were no others available, (I now know the reason why we got in here)!Maybe the double rooms are better, but I can only say it like it is."
128,1230,"May 29 2006	Great location Enjoyable place to stay	I stayed at this Hotel and had a great time. The price was great and the people were very helpful. Even though my single room was small, it was clean and quiet. The close proximenty to all transportation was great and there were many choices for meals in a 2-3 block area. Hyde Park is only 3 blocks away. I would stay here again!"
129,1230,"May 29 2006	Hyde Park Towers	Having looked at some of the previous reviews, I am wondering if any of the writers confused this hotel with the Hyde Park Inn (across the street) or another similarly named hotel - both of which were hostel type hotels. I arrived late at night. The reception desk was slow. I had booked a single room and had to drag my luggage thorugh some narrow hallways and down some stairs to get there. Within a few minutes I realised that there was water coming through the ceiling. There was no problem in changing my room and the receptionist helped with my luggage. The bed and room were clean. The hot water took some time to come through. I stayed for 3 nights. This hotel is very close to Bayswater tube station. My only problem there were the steps at the tube station to haul my luggage up. Breakfast was fine. My reservation had included breakfast and the receptionist said it didn't . When I challenged that, it was no problem and they did not charge me. The biggest problem was on the second night. The people overhead were very noisy. We asked at the desk if they could ask the people to be quieter and they refused saying&quot; it is our policy that guests have the right to do what they want while here&quot;. They offered a change in our room but it would have been very inconvenient at the time to do so. Next night was better. No real complaints at this hotel."
130,1230,"May 21 2006 	great little hotel	I recently stayed at the Hyde Park Towers Hotel and I thought it was quite nice. I did only stay one night as I was on a training course with work. I booked through lastminute.com and found it very easy. I rang the night before to ask what time I could check in, I was told 3pm. I knew I was going to arrive aerlier than this so asked if I could arrive earlier and was advised if the room was ready I could or could leave my luggage if not. So I thought that was pretty helpful. I arrived at 1.30 and my room was ready which was great so I could check in straight away. I had a single room so I wasn't expecting it to be a big room and yes it was small but it did the job for me. It was clean, I had a nice little bed and tea/coffee and a telly. The bathroom was also small but again had everything you needed. The hotel is also right by Bayswater tube station which was great because I thought I would get lost trying to find it! I thought the area was really quaint, lovely victorian buildings and tree lined streets. If you are looking for a good value hotel which is easily accessible and has friendly staff then I would recommend this hotel. Might be a bit too small for families but travellers or people on business then its a great option. i noticed a couple of americans in the lobby asking for advice on where to go and the staff where very helpful and directed them on a map and had plently of trip guides as well. One other point, but I noticed that the prices at the hotel stated 140 a night single and 160 a night double! Just make sure you book through lastminute.com because I only paid 43 for a single room only. (I think breakfast is 5 more)"
131,1230,"May 15 2006	Outstanding	This was my first time traveling to london. A little scared after I booked the hotel and reading some of the reviews. Let's just say when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised. Outstanding safe location (I'm a female traveling alone), very fair rate, right by tube station and a cute (but small) room. I must say...I will definitely be staying at Hyde Park Towers again."
132,1230,"May 13 2006 	Not that bad for this price....	I was staying in worse places for the same money, I actually called them up before I checked in and asked for a quiet room, since I wasn't in London just for fun. They honored my request, so I cant complain about the service. The room wasnt big, but to be honest, I had smaller ones in this city. It was clean and had a real bathroom. Thats about what you can expect in this price class. Get real people. Except for the worn out matress it was fine."
133,1230,"Apr 10 2006 	Overcharged!	I paid for a colleague to stay there via lastminute[...] On arrival they said his booking hadn't come through, but that apparently happened frequently and they gave him a room.Next morning it was realised that I booked the wrong day, but instead of honouring the rate (I could have booked through lastminute again)They ripped us off by a further 22.This hotel is a crummy flea pit, run by crooks! Avoid at all cost."
134,1230,"Mar 28 2006	Location Perfection	After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, I was skeptical about the reservation we made. However, after staying there for a week from March 20 to March 27, 2006, I can say the location made this place along with the price. I booked a package through Orbitz so I really have no idea what exactly I paid for the hotel itself. Having said that, I noted behind the front desk on check-in that the price for a double was 160 British pounds for a double (approximately $260.00), which would have made this place very overpriced. I know we paid in the range of approximately $120.00 to $130.00 a night with our package. This is all speculation as I said we booked a package.First of all, thanks to TripAdvisor I knew a few things, such as to ask for a room on the second or third floor because of the fact the tube runs directly underneath the hotel. We could still hear the trains rumble on the third floor! Not a big deal, since it was very faint. However, staying on the first floor (second floor in England) would not have been good. The problem is that the tube line in this area is close to the surface of the ground, and thus the problem. The room (Room No. 317-non-smoking) was not as small as I expected, and after peaking into rooms being cleaned, can say that the rooms are New York hotel size. We had a room in the front. You cannot open the window as the noise from the street will keep you up all night. I assume it would be more quiet in the back with the windows open, but I would not count on that in this area of London. The room was clean and fresh towels every day.The bathroom was very small, even by New York standards. It was the length of a bathtub (a nice plus I thought) but the sink was on the left and the toilet on the right. Technically, you could brush your teeth while sitting on the toilet. But, to my surprise, there was plenty of that all important shelf space for your toothbrush, and pesonal toilet items. There was also a nice shelf for such items at one end of the bathtub.Although advertised as &quot;recently refurbished,&quot; I can say that this would be considered false advertising. Everything was very worn from the chairs in the so called &quot;bar&quot; to the sofas in the reception. The bar is only technically that. There were times late night that a few people gathered to have a drink and chat and have a night cap, but the person at the reception was the bartender. The floor behind the bar was filthy as I noticed when I actually went up to order a drink after summoning the night clerk a/k/a bartender.As for the free continental breakfast, I have had better. The croissants were OK, but there was little else. Bread was medicore, a few apples rounded out the buffet. A couple of mornings my husband and I decided to work a short block over to Starbucks and have real coffee and a roll at a nominal price. It was a short walk and convenient. Of course, the real reason for staying here had nothing to do with anything I just mentioned. It is location, location, location. Next to Bayswater Tube station, across from Hyde Park, walking distance of Kensington and Chelsea area, with great restaurants in the area, it was the location that brought people to stay here from all over the world (and the price). The hotel had been full every night for weeks (and in the off season)! Would I stay here again? Maybe, based on the price. For location (I have stayed in this area before at higher priced places), there is no better deal. But, be prepared. You get what you pay for!"
135,1230,Mar 17 2006	Very good area	This hotel is set in a very prime location.There is a the bayswater tube station located 3 minutes walk away.There is also a long stretch of shops and restaurants located a stones throw away from the hotel. There is also a fantastic shopping mall nearby.I am very pleased with this hotel as we paid 49 pounds per night for 4 of us. It was a very good deal and the rooms are descent sized.The staff was very friendly and there is a descent restaurant and bar next to the hotel lobby
136,1230,"Mar 11 2006 	Just fine for a few days	I read up on the hotel after finding a last-minute deal and was a bit worried by the reviews. But, it turns out the hotel is perfectly fine. Like others have said, the location is absolutely great. Bayswater is fun and lively, and I felt completely safe. I loved the neighborhood and would absolutely recommend staying around there.The hotel itself is a budget hotel - so don't go expecting valet parking or chandeliers - but I found it to be clean, orderly, and a decent place to get a good night's sleep. Actually, I'm surprised anybody complained about the place -- for the price, I thought it was quite a steal. Then again, I am a frequent traveller and have wandered my way through some pretty remote parts of the world, so my standards might be lower than other reviewers'. I had a basement room with miniscule windows, but otherwise I couldn't find one single thing to complain about. The bathrooms were clean, my room was small but reasonable, the staff was helpful, the hotel was quiet (besides Tube running by, but my own apartment has more street noise than the hotel did) and the free breakfast was decent. I agree with one poster that you should try to get to breakfast early, as there is a bit of a stampede. Overall, no complaints for a cheap hotel - I would go back if another last-minute deal popped up."
137,1230,"Mar 5 2006	It was fine	Just got back from London (2/21 - 2/26), and stayed at the Hyde Park Towers Hotel in Bayswater. The location is great, just 150 feet from the Bayswater tube, which is the Circle Line which gets you to most attractions without changing to other tube lines (e.g. it took 20 minutes to Big Ben/Westminster Abbey; 30 minutes to Tower of London). The hotel was panned here by a few people as unfriendly staff, etc. but we had a very pleasant experience. The staff was helpful and very friendly, the location great, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The only negatives were the crowd of people between 9 - 10 at the (included) continental breakfast (get there early); and they were having a problem with the boiler, so hot water was diminished after 8 am. Please note that the next street over (where the tube station is) is filled with shops and restaurants, and the area felt very safe. I'd definetly stay in Bayswater area again."
138,1230,"Feb 21 2006	Disappointing	As we only paid 44.00 pounds per night I did not bother to make a complaint. However, the following areas were disappointing. I think as we requested a NO SMOKING room we had the one of the worst rooms in the hotel, it was below the pavement level and our window looked out onto a tiny courtyard(full of cigarette butts). It certainly felt claustrophobic, I asked if we could move and was given keys to 2 more rooms which were like shoe boxes. So we stayed put(room B28). We never had hot water, barely luke warm, the kettle was changed as the original didnt work, the room shook every time a tube came into the station. Breakfast was like a cattle market, not enough tables and chairs, very little choice of food items and what was there was low quality. I would not stay there again."
139,1230,"Nov 17 2005 	Flea Pit	This is the dirtiest, smelliest, unfreindly horrible hoitel I have ever seen.The beds were urine stained then pillows were brown, and the carpet looked like a garage forecourt. Luckily, this was their best room!! I complained and never stayed, (rather stay on the street....) but they refused to recredit my card. Never, ever ever consider staying here."
140,1230,"Nov 13 2005 	Low standard	Stayed at Hyde Park Towers at the end of October. First impression was bad because the room key didn't work. The receptionist implied I didn't know how to use it properly even though the maintenance guy couldn't open the door with the master key. I was moved to another room where the key also didn't work. Receptionist gave me 4 keys to the room and I was able to find one that worked.Receptionist on second day was better and that of the third was better yet.Room was tiny as expected. Had a room at the back which was noisy as there were some businesses with their entrance at the back. The window wouldn't shut properly so it seemed like anyone talking in the back alley was right outside my window. Required 50 pound deposit to turn on the phone. That's a first for me. Phone didn't work for the toll free number I was using so was forced to use the smelly (human waste) pay phone outside. Also tried the pay phone in the lobby with no luck.Breakfast was fine although staff sometimes seemed more interested in socializing amongst themselves which I found unprofessional. Generally I'm not that picky about hotels and prefer budget hotels to fancy places, but this was substandard. I was on my own so was prepared to lower the bar a little. Would never take wife or kids there.I would not go back."
141,1230,"Oct 21 2005 	Not Too Bad	I stayed two nights and paid 45 per night As a single I expected a small room and this was the case. I do not think it would be any different anywhere else. Both room and en suite were clean with fresh towels and cleaned daily. Doubt you would want to spend time in room other than to sleep but why would youPrice included breakfast, selection of cereals, fruit juices, fruit. toast, coffee, youghurt. You could upgrade to cooked if required and prices not too bad.I did not find staff unfriendly, rather polite and helpfulLocation great ideal for everything"
142,1230,"Oct 9 2005	Not that bad!	Having read the previous reviews I was concerned that I had booked a real lemon but it's not all that bad, yes some of the staff aren't exactly customer focused (the nightwatchman however is very helpful) and you can hear the tube but as this stops running through the night it shouldn't keep you awake. The room was a reasonable size by UK standard and the bathroom was clean enough. We paid 50 for a double room which in London is hard to beat. Would I stay here again? definitely, would I recommend it to my favourite Aunt? probably not!."
143,1230,"Sep 11 2005	it's allright at the right price	As most people have noted, it's just a short walk away from the bayswater tube station. This can be great for getting around town but it does have certain drawbacks. The vibrations due to the tube do transmitt to the lower floors of the hotel. So if you do get something on the lower floors, you might be in for a long night.... I did stay on the third floor with a window facing the back. Though the view wasn't pretty, it was a quiet little room. The rooms are small, but acceptable. I did manage to get a good deal for it at about 50 for a double which represented excellent value. Wouldn't really consider this hotel if I had to pay more than that though."
144,1230,"Sep 5 2005	Look elsewhere!	There is a thing called customer service, which this hotel utterly lacked. In the last few months we have stayed in a number of hotels and, may I say, this is the only one I have had negative experiences at. If it is not the size of the rooms, it will be their unclean and stained surfaces, or their unrepaired water taps (only hot in shower), or smelly towels. The attitude of staff is just slightly better than that of management. The management is completely disinterested in providing ambience (aside from the little found at reception) or a pleasant experience. They lacked the ability to deal with smaller issues such as a refund of 10% for parking as represented, insisting instead that we write a letter of complaint on this subject to which we did not receive a reply or acknowledgement. The only interest this hotel has is in processing your payment, not really in seeing you return there again! Believe everything you read by previous guests; do not stay here for more than 45 and even then, shop around in the area. My next visit in London at 40 and 45 (per room, per night) was much, much more pleasant."
145,1230,Aug 26 2005	Hated Hyde Park Towers	What a shocker!!!! The room was the size of a closet and there was a bathroom inside that. The dirty bathroon is another story. The walls were grubby the pillow smelt like bad breath!!!!!! What is with that? The staff were rude and hovered around you at breakfast. My 4 day stay in London was almost ruined by the revolting Hotel. Ambience rating - zeroAlso my hair was ruined by the sub standard hairdryer that sucked my hair up inside itself.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
146,1230,"Aug 11 2005	Cosy	The location was excellent- only 1 minute from Bayswater tube station. I stayed in a single first floor room for 40. The hotel was pleasantly clean and the room small but comfortable with good working shower and toilet. I couldn't hear any outdoor noise and slept soundly. Breakfast was continental buffet with cereal, fruit, cheese, pastries and coffee/tea, nothing special. However, the staff rang me up 15 minutes before noon to remind me to check out, and gave me glaring stares when I waited at the lobby afterwards for a friend. I might stay there again as long as it doesn't get any more expensive than 40."
147,1230,"Aug 5 2005	They shipped the discounted travellers to smaller hotel!!	Just got back from London and am livid with this hotel! We arrived a bit early but they seemed very keen to check us in and take our payment upfront. Then the receptionist said there was a problem with the room and we were being transferred to another hotel by taxi. She was very cagey and wouldnt tell us what was wrong with the room other than we couldn't have it. Other couples waiting had been told the same and it transpired we had all paid the same discounted rate for our rooms. Other guests arriving from abroad who had paid full rate were warmly greeted and shown to their rooms. We waited almost half an hour for the taxi to arrive. The driver then drove us to a tiny b&amp;b and said there you go, and drove off. It certainly wasnt the 4 star hotel we were promised! We had no choice but to stay as we couldnt afford to pay the full rate for nearby better hotels."
148,1230,Aug 1 2005	Close to Underground the only good point	We stayed there for four nights on the london part of our honeymoon being so close to 2 different lines on the underground and the location is excellent i will give it that .After reading the reviews of some people on here I thought that is could not be all that bad and went to try it out .After getting to the hotel and getting down to our room up and down stairs as there are raised and lowered levels on each floor we found a shoe box sized room but this did not bother us as we were not spending that much time in there . It was the mould covering the bathroom the hairs found in the bed and the Fire Alarms that went off through the night (they were being Repeired the whole time we were there) and at 5 am having to get up and go down to the reception to be told they are just doing tests and not even getting a appology really made me cranky as well as the repair men having access to our room while we were not there and not telling us .Breakfast was OJ and a Roll and a bowl of Corn FlakesLook else wear in Bayswater for accom .
149,1230,Jul 28 2005	london 4 day break	just returned from 4 day break in london stayed at hyde park towers inverness cres. nice small hotel rooms cleaned every day breakfast good and cheap if u wanted to upgrade for extra. close to bus and tube.
150,1230,"Jul 27 2005	good deal	I've stayed there for five nights. the room was small but we had clean towels everyday and the surroundings are nice. some pretty restaurants and two underground stations very close. Despite the fact that the underground line runs just under the building, you can live pretty comfortably. Paid 100 Euros per night for a twin room with bathroom...quite a good deal if you consider your very close to the centre. If I had to come back I would definitely choose it again. After all, no need to say that you get what you pay for, many places can be much more expensive without being in such a convenient location."
151,1230,"Jul 19 2005	Clean but noisy	We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2005. First the good points. The rooms we had were small but clean. The beds were comfortable. We had a bath and TV. We were very close to the Bayswater tube station, and there were a lot of restaurants and stores within a couple of blocks. The problem was there is no air conditioning and it was quite warm while we were there. We had the windows wide open, and our room faced the street so we heard everyone who walked by, chatted, heard the garbage truck at 5 am. Then at 7am - and this was not the hotel's fault - the construction across the street began loudly. And due to jet lag we were having trouble with sleeping anyway, so the noise did NOT help."
152,1230,"Jun 12 2005 	Worst hotel I've ever stayed in	When I checked into this hotel the first room they gave me was right off reception and I could hear every word that each guest was saying. There was very loud inappropriate music being played in the reception. The music poured into my room which I am convinced was an old utility closet because there were black oil stains all over the carpet, it was TINY and there was a very loud extraction fan outside the window. No light was coming in through the window so in the middle of the day my room was pitch black. When I asked to move, the lady said all they had left were rooms in the basement. I went to have a look and although it was quieter (apart from hearing the buzzing of the subway below) it certainly wasn't any cleaner. There were cigarette burns all over the blanket and the bathroom looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a while. There was also no light coming in from the window and the television didn't work. I took it anyway because I would rather stay in a dirty hotel room than an oil stained utility closet anyday. I would never go back again."
153,1230,"Jun 9 2005 	Dreadful	This hotel is an absolute disgrace. The rooms was dirty asnd very cramped. the beds was uncomfortable and had springs coming through. there was a constant rumble from the tube until 1am and started again at 0430! A complete rip off, avoid at all costs."
154,1230,"Apr 12 2005	Location location location!!!	I upgraded to this hotel on an internet hotel/flight deal. I had read reviews previously and had some trepidation based on those. I understood that English hotels were often converted from row houses and the standards might not be what I was used to in the states.  With that in mind, The Hyde Park Towers was pretty basic lodging. The first night they were unable to put my son and me into the double room we had requested so put us into two singles on the same floor. His was an acceptable size but mine was minuscule. You had to sit sideways on the toilet or else straddle the pipe from the sink. The second night our room was much bigger overlooking the main street. The beds were on rollers so he moved his by the window. The continental breakfast was rolls, cereal, and juices but you could pay a few pounds more for a hot breakfast. The staff was helpful but the best thing was it's location to shopping, dining, parks, bus routes and two Tube entrances. As other reviewers said, who spends a lot of time in their room anyway??? If you don't have really high expectations, you likely won't be disappointed!!!"
155,1230,"Mar 1 2005	Close to the underground	We were expecting this hotel to be dreadful as it was booked as part of a package deal with our airfare. However, when we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised: it was quite plush, the staff were helpful, the room was clean and even had a tv and a bath. Indeed, we spent at least 5 minutes congratulating ourselves on our good luck. This was a little pre-emptive however. As we stood there, a giant rumble violently shook the room, knocking our belongings off the bedside table. As we looked at each other, our minds initially filled with images of the tsunami which had struck the previous week. Returning to reality, we looked outside the window and realised our ground floor room had a view of the subway ventilation shaft; and that the giant rumble was not a dramatic one-off but an experience to be repeated approximately every three minutes. Needless to say, we did not get very much sleep. We were very glad we were only booked to stay one night at this hotel, as it would have ruined our stay in London. That said, apart from the shaking and rattling, this was an otherwise pleasant hotel, in a convienient location, with a hearty breakfast."
156,1230,"Feb 22 2005	Better than anticipated!	My wife and I stayed at the Hyde Park Towers from January 30 to February 3, 2005 as part of a vacation package deal. Just before flying out of New York, I read some of the negative postings that some individuals had written about the hotel and wondered what I had gotten my wife and I into. From the time we arrived from Heathrow till the day we left, we had nothing but a positive experience. When we arrived at the front desk, the receptionist took our luggage and held it safely until our room could be made up from all the people who were staying there for the weekend. This truly is an international hotel with people from all over the world converging here. Yes, the room (224) was small but that is to be expected when traveling overseas. As for the noise from the &quot;tube&quot;, it was negligible on the second floor. Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Some postings about the hotel complained about the continental breakfast of cereal, rolls, croissants, etc. but failed to mention that you could upgrade to eggs, sausages, etc. for an additional few pounds. As for the location of the hotel, it was superb. There are two underground train stations (Baywater and Queensway) within easy walking distance to take an individual to any part of London within a relatively short period of time. In short, if I were to return to London in the near future, I would not hesitate for one moment to return to the Hyde Park Towers."
157,1230,"Dec 8 2004	Good location clean good service good breakfast	Over the years stayed in hotels in San Francisco, LA, Vegas, Washington,Chicago, Boston, New York, Singapore, Hong Kong, Sydney, Ayers Rock, Cairo, Dehli etc etc.Bit dismayed about the previous reviews having seen them after booking a stay for last weekend 4-5/12/04Been changes since previous reviews.Can confirm small rooms but not overly so. Fairly typical of London 3* hotels. Quite adequate and to be fair there is nothing the management can do.The rooms we stayed in 123 &amp; 133 were very clean. Bedding fresh and furniture not tired. Underground noise yes but I heard underground noise at Broadway shows! All part of London.Location was near Queensway on the Central Line and Bayswater on the Circle/District. Not intimidating area.Breakfast was first class and the staff very helpful. Had a good Italian 3 course meal in Queensway in the next street.Been visiting London for weekends for many years and would stay here again."
158,1230,"Dec 7 2004	The worst Hotel I have stayed in	I stayed here recently and it was absolutley awful. We saw a mouse in our room and let the management know. It seemed that they did not believe us. We were in the basement and the room was tiny and not in the greatest condition. We came in one night to find that the bar was closing just as we came in, however there were some regular guest as the women behind the bar was chatting to them about previous times there. She would continue to go behind the closed bar and serve them drinks, when we enquired about getting a drink she was moody and told us the bar was closed and that the pub round the coener was still open.This is the worst hotels I have ever had the mis-fortune of staying in."
159,1230,"Dec 1 2004	Great value hotel	I missed my train home to Manchester recently and had to find some where cheap to stay. I found online a hotel called the Hyde Park Towers, it was in a great location, was really clean. The staff were great as i had nothing with me and sorted out a toothbrush for me and a razor.All that for only 60 and the breakfast was quite good too. Great cheap hotel in London"
160,1230,Nov 16 2004	would not go back	room and bathroom were tiny... the wardrobe was infront of window &amp; the room was so small you had no room for luggage &amp; if you wanted to open them you had to put on bed. everytime time a train went past it seemed like the room was shaking. the breakfast was very dissapointing &amp; plain. the location of hotel was central and the staff friendly but I will not go back to this hotel.
161,1230,"Oct 28 2004	Fantastic	Excellent Location, room size more than adequate.(We never planned to stay in the room all day - and who would!)The staff were friendly and smiling, the room was clean and comfortable.Would definately go back. Have the others who have written reviews stayed in the same place?For the money I paid I just can't fault the place - really enjoyable time."
162,1230,"Oct 20 2004	Not Too Good	Rooms and bathrooms were small as expected in London, but also run very down property. Beds were very uncomfortable, lift in hotel was very small and very slow. Breakfast is included in all rates, which consists of crossionts, rolls, creals, tea/coffee and juice only. No hot breakfast option, and breakfast room is small and overcrowded - bad set up. I would not stay at this hotel again."
163,1230,"Oct 15 2004	Very Disappointed	The Norfolk Towers looks very nice from the front and the entrance hall. However the room had an awful smell of chemicals and the wall paper was hanging off the wall.Due to the awful smell it was necessary to have the window open all the time. The description of the hotel claims it is in a quiet back street. The side of the hotel is on a quiet back street, but if you have a room at the front these are on a major bus route. I was woken at 5:30 every morning due to the traffic noise.I regularly stay in London on business and would not use the Norfok Towers again, there are far better hotels available for the same price."
164,1230,"Oct 13 2004	Think again!	Close to the tube and Hyde Park but! ask yourself if it's worth it. We had a twin room and I've seen small rooms but these take the ticket and you can't swing a cat in the bathrooms. We asked what time the restaurant opened in the evening to be told rudely &quot;We're not really doing that tonight, we're too busy. It's more like room service.&quot; However! the menu said 'Restaurant', if it's not I suggest they remove all indications of one. So I had a diet coke, it was flat straight out of the bottle which makes me wonder how long they had it. The next day after we'd returned in the afternoon we found they hadn't put any towels in the bathroom and so called down to the desk to find out what had happened. They said that the delivery was running late and they should be here soon. Ok that's fine, waiting ... waiting. About an hour later we saw the linen truck pull up out the front. Waiting, waiting, we waited another hour till finally I went down to the desk and &quot;Oh yeah the towels&quot; and shoved a stack at me. We asked for some ice another time only to be told that it would cost 1 pound for a cup of ice ... 1 pound? it's frozen water! Everything seemed a major inconvenience to the staff. Would not recommend it."
