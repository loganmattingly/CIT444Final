12,1151,"Sep 19 2009 	There is no doubt it is the staff that makes this hotel great	We stayed here at the end of a 2 week trip. The hotel is older but is clean and has a good feel to it. The location is a little inconvenient to the tube, but there are is always a taxi available. (we sometimes took them to the tube station!)The concierge was available and ready to help with anything.The restaurant staff though made it like dining with friends. I am leary of hotel restaurants. They are usually convenient but that is all. The food was good and the staff made sure you got exactly what you wanted. Kelly and Cristel were there with a smile in the morning serving whatever we wanted. One morning we dined by the window alcove in the lobby, the next morning in the dining room. A friendly smile, all the right touches and lots of coffee!In the evening we had the charming Fabrizzio. Our last night was our 25th wedding anniversary. It had been a long trip and of course, being London, it was raining hard! We stayed in for dinner and Fabrizzio made a memory of it. We even had a wonderful desert wishing us a Happy 25th Anniversary and we felt so special. I don't know how this hotel finds such wonderful people but I hope they all realize how special they are."
13,1151,"Aug 25 2009 	It was true -- the nicest and the best staff.	I had read other reviews on tripadvisor and thought they had to be exaggerating. But no, this hotel has the nicest, most helpful staff -- everyone without exception was helpful. Nothing needed to make our stay more pleasant seemed too much trouble. They even volunteered to follow up on our lost luggage -- who else would do that? Once they located it, they were considerate enough to call before delivering it to our room since it was so late at night.I agree that the bathrooms are very small; but they are really clean which is very important."
14,1151,"Aug 7 2009 	Great Location Cozy Excellent Service	I have stayed here three times and I really like this location - you are walking distance from the Knightsbridge Underground station, Harrods, a lot of couture shops and the Brompton Road. The immediate neighbourhood is peaceful and pleasant.While the rooms are small (like many in London) the furnishings are elegant, the air conditioning works (in August, that matters!) the bathrooms are well equipped and clean and the staff are pleasant, attentive and efficient. There is a cozy place in the lobby to have tea or drinks with colleagues or friends which makes it a good kick off point for joint business or social events. There is no on-site gym or pool so fitness freaks will have to jog in the neighborhood or go off-site."
15,1151,"Aug 1 2009 	A nice classy hotel that requires some furnishing updates..	We stayed in Sheraton for two nights ( we had 2 adjacent rooms for us and our kids) -thanks to SPG points. We were welcomed very warmly into the hotel ( I like their very informal reception area). The rooms themselves were nice - but the rooms needs some updating in terms of soundproofing. Even though this hotel is not in a busy street - we could still hear vehicle noises through the night (windows were closed and curtains drawn). The A/C system was also making some serious amounts of start/stop noise ( I think those units need some servicing or probably a replace to something more modern). The hotel is NOT very near to any of the tubes ( if you have kids - it is a good walk to Knightsbridge or Victoria). However, you can easily walk ( if you are a walker!) to almost most of the attractions in london from here. We walked upto Big Ben and back with our kids (older than 8) without any issues. Internet connection is expensive ( 20 pounds) - but the speed you get for that is PATHETIC. I personally don't have a problem paying money (whatever the asking is in a particular place) for internet as long as I get decent speeds. London (and Europe in general) for me was a disappointment in terms of speeds ( I am currently writing this from India - a &quot;third&quot; world country - where the connection is just downright fantastic). Overall, I would recommend this hotel with some reservations ( Since I didn't pay money for my stay (thanks Starwood) - my review may be biased slightly in saying that this is a good hotel to stay -but if I was paying money ( and I think the rates were closer to 150 pounds a night) - then I would give them a MAYBE as a recommendation."
16,1151,"Jul 22 2009 	Understated elegant and quiet hotel but pricey extras	I stayed here for one night before going on to Paris, using a Free Night Reward from the SPG programme. The welcome was very friendly and the room on the second floor was spacious, with a view over a green space outside. I got the impression that nothing was too much trouble. It was a very leafy, quiet area. The bed was the usual fabulously comfy Sheraton bed and the bathroom was spotless with all the usual amenities. The TV was quite dated- no flatscreen here, just an old -style one, not even widescreen. Boring selection of channels- all European news!The hotel is small by Sheraton standards- only 89 rooms, and the front desk was literally a small desk with two chairs so if it's big and bold you like, this isn't the hotel for you. As is usual with London hotels and most Sheraton hotels, the mini bar, room service and breakfast were all expensive- 21 for breakfast. However there was a good choice of buffet items and the cooked breakfast was tasty. I wouldn't have paid it had I not got the room for free! The hotel is around 10 minutes to Knightsbridge and I felt completely safe walking back to the hotel from the tube after midnight as a lone female. Nearby on Motcomb Street are a whole lot of eateries, and I wholeheartedly recommend Ottolenghi, a tiny bakery/patisserie/deli who sell gorgeous cakes and pastries (would be great for breakfast) as well as a gorgeous array of salads, quiches and cold meats). Hyde Park is also 5 minutes away, as is Park Lane. In summary, I would recommend this hotel for quiet, elegance and intimate surroundings and spot-on service. A relaxing place to come back to after the bright lights and sights."
17,1151,"Jul 19 2009 	Comfortable and Clean	We stayed at this location for three nights with our small family. Upon arrival the staff is courteous. The lobby is small and cozy. It gave me time to sit and watch the staff at work. They were wonderful. I noticed different guests with a varied amount of requests. Outside of making a fitness center in the lobby, they were able to handle anything. It was always a pleasure to see any of them at the desks. They have an arrangement with the nearby Sheraton location to use their facilities. It worked well.Our room was on the 1st floor. Which by American terms is the second. The ground floor is &quot;0&quot;. Anyway, I thought we might have a challenge with noise from the restaurant or the street. We did not. Our room was perfect for us. The extra bed for our son was brought in and we were set. This is on our list for a place to visit again. Thank you, Sheration Belgravia Staff! Our family had a delightful time in your hotel."
18,1151,"Jul 16 2009 	Nice stay good location	My wife and I stayed here in June 2009. A nice hotel, nothing fancy. We used Starpoints for our stay and I'm a gold member. We were upgraded to the 10th floor with a great view of surrounding area. Room was adequate. Border line 4 star hotel. Small hotel lobby, staff very courteous and friendly. We had lunch here and it was good. My wife had some fish and I had a burger. It was a little expensive but tasty. The front desk was very helpful. The hotel is very close to Harrod's. Its within walking distance to Buckingham Palace. If you enjoy walking, you can see all of London's main sites within two days from this hotel. You can walk to Westminster Abbey and Piccadilly and Covent Garden from this hotel. Catch a boat ride from the London Eye area and see the London Tower and Tower Bridge.One complaint is the television was extremely outdated. Its a tube and flat screens are in most 4 star hotels now.In the end, we enjoyed this hotel but we would probably stay at the Sheraton Park Tower next time as a comparison. We felt very safe walking at night in the Belgravia neighborhood. Its a very upscale area to live. It felt more of a business hotel though. If you want to feel more of a vacation perhaps stay at Sheraton Park Tower or the Piccadilly hotel."
19,1151,Jul 14 2009 	Nice Quiet Hotel in a terrific area	Nice hotel with very well appointed rooms and perfect location. Close to all the &quot;happening&quot; places in the city and in a &quot;posh&quot; district.
20,1151,"Jul 8 2009 	Great staff great room great location value?	Just returned from a 5-night stay at the Sheraton Belgravia (my second stay with them). Overall highly enjoyable. Every single staff interaction was wonderful, with staff going out of their way in every instance. The room was very large (for Europe), well appointed, and comfortable. Location in a quiet residential neighborhood (with easy access to everything you need) was, for us, perfect. The rooms are in the early stages of needing a facelift (new carpet, paint, bathroom faucets, etc...), but it sounds like that is in the works, and this should not be a deterrent to a stay there in the short term.The only real questionable issue is around the value. We stayed on Starwood Points and wanted to extend our stay (paid) for a few more nights. At 297 pounds per night (lowest available rate for several months running), there were far better values to be had, even in London.....we will definitely come back, but always on Starwood points, business account, or at a far lower rate..."
21,1151,"Jul 6 2009 	Great experience	My husband &amp; I stayed here following a week's cruise on QM2 - it was a nice transition. The staff were without exception helpful and attentive. Upon arrival we were seated in the casual coffee area, offered beverages during registration, and made to feel at home. Our room was not ready but we were offered upgrade and it was ready following our lunch. We used room service several times following theatre and found the food to be more than remarkable for a hotel. The food was not inexpensive, but it was excellent, well served, and always very prompt.. Unlike larger hotels, there was never a problem with services - we'd leave and return to find everything perfect. The concierge was also a gem - got us great tickets for Globe when we failed. Service and quality appointments were the watchword throughout our stay. Only drawback for tourist (which we were) is the somewhat distant location from center of activities. We typically took a cab into town and went from there. We have stayed at Park Lane in past and while it is much more convenient, it is just not the same quality of experience. If you are up and out early and late - a hotel doesn't matter that much, but we enjoy the experience of being able to be at home in our home away from home. We also have to do some work early or late and the room had a great desk with a view of the City.. The neighborhood was very nice - lots of embassies in the area and very safe. We walked to Sloan Avenue, to Harrods, to a local pub and just around the neighborhood - felt at home. It was a great experience all around. Highly recommend the Belgravia"
22,1151,"Jun 21 2009 	Run down understaffed poor value	I recently stayed here for 1 night with my family, and I was glad to leave after the night. This hotel is tired and run down. Our room had worn furniture, stains on the walls that looked like they were a result of water damage, and a barely functional TV (none of the features other than tuning to regular TV channels worked). On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable. Service was responsive when you could get hold of someone, but the front desk is understaffed -- it is literally a desk and they can handle only one party at a time. I requested connecting or adjoining rooms when I reserved, and received rooms on 2 different floors. I also requested a late check-out for both rooms at check-in, which was honored (my Platinum status with SPG should make this automatic), but when I went the next day to verify as we were going out for the morning, I was told I could only have the late check-out from one room and needed to vacate the other room immediately. Later, I waited 20 minutes to check out, while the family ahead of me went through a prolonged check-in process.There are too many good hotels in London to spend money here; if you are looking for a Starwood property, the Sheraton Park Tower is much better and only slightly more expensive. It is also in a better location, only 1 block from the Knightsbridge tube stop, vs. 7 or 8 for the Belgravia."
23,1151,Jun 5 2009 	Perfect hotel in a near perfect location	Just returned from a five night stay at the Sheraton Belgravia and could not have been more pleased.We stayed there using Starwood points. The hotel is within walking distance range of most sights but far enough away to enjoy a little bit of peace and tranquility after a long day of touring. The staff was very friendly and helped us with finding restaurants and getting some attraction tickets.When we did have problems with our air conditioning it was attended to promptly..The only negative is there is only one computer for internet use if you choose not to use your own. If I return to London I would not stay anywhere else.
24,1151,"May 27 2009 	The Sheraton Belgravia in London is fit for a queen.	Wow, a friend and I just returned after a delightful week's stay at the Sheraton Belgravia, ideally situated across from a key park in the embassy area of London. It was beautifully appointed with antiques in our room and lobby. We were within walking distance of the Chelsea Flower Show (our main destination), Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey. The hotel has an excellent chef from Argentinia, who created some memorable dishes, including the guiney pie and peach torte, which were especially delicious! The concierge Gregors was always available to help with directions, money exchange and transportation needs. The housekeeping staff was also excellent, tidying up each day. We will definitely return for our next visit."
25,1151,"May 20 2009 	A Comfortable Hotel with Excellent Service	We stayed here from May 6 through 10 on Starwood Points. We were very pleased with our stay.We stayed in room 906. It was a bit on the small side.....approximately 275 feet including the bath room. The outstanding feature of this hotel is the staff including the concierge desk, office and housekeeping department.We had twin beds, a small dresser clutered with items from the mini-bar on a tray and an older t.v. Fortunately there was a small round table on which we could place items along with a desk. There is one night stand between the two beds and a lounge chair leaving very little free floor space. Lighting was adequate. The bath room was very nice.....all tiled in white and very clean. They hotel provided a hair dryer, a magnifying mirror (no light for same), a tub/shower combination with an extra hand wand in addition to the wall shower head. The water pressure was fair. Very good counter and shelf space. Good lighting.The hotel is about 6 blocks from two subway stations (Knightsbridge and Sloan Square) and very close to Knightsbridge/Sloan St/Brompton shopping. The walk to Hyde Park takes about 10 minutes.Restaurants we visited: Il Portico (Italian-Excellent), Blue Lagoon (a Thai restaurant....very, very casual, but excellent food at good prices) and very close to the Theater we attended, Bangkok (Thai) and Tamarind (very popular and highly rated Indian, but we did not enjoy). We would certainly return to this hotel."
26,1151,"Apr 26 2009 	Stay here!	We've been to London many times (my husband is originally from here) and this is easily one of the best places we've stayed. Superb location, comfortable rooms and common areas, great service - you will not find better overall value for your money anywhere in London. There's a Waitrose (and a Starbuck's) a few blocks away which was great, you can buy snacks and drinks there and keep them in your room - very handy. We had dinner at Motcomb's (on Motcomb St) and it was fantastic. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant (we rarely do) so can't comment on it. We will definitely stay here again!p.s. The Patisserie Valerie (also on Motcomb) was a huge disappointment, we absolutely love PV but this location is quite small and the service was very poor."
27,1151,Apr 14 2009 	Charming hotel	The hotel is lovely but not bright at all. Location is relatively central. But be aware that neighborhood is very quiet and breakfast is extremely expensive...
28,1151,"Mar 29 2009 	Wonderfull location - residential and family oriented area	First let me say that I previoulsy read many complimentary reviews on this Sheraton before making my reservation. I can validate that this is a gem of a hotel and I highly recommend you stay at the Sheraton Belgravia.From the start, all of the staff I interacted with were intersted in making this stay a wonderfull experiernce. The restuarant food and service was excellent. The studio hotel room was spacious, clean and modern. The interior ws lovery - highly recommend the studio rooms for size and elegance. The hotel is located in walking distance of Hyde Park, Harrods, and many finner dinning facilities. The hotel located in a expensive residential part of The City of Westminster. Very safe to walk around after dark. There is a Starbucks, Grocery Store, boutique / retail shopping and Barclay bank very close bye. Also, the area is surrounded by several inviting green parks.Unique - I am a bit of a car nut. If you like Aston Martins, Lambo's, Bentley's, Ferrari's, MB and BMW's; there is no short of them in this area of town. Just hang out and listen / watch them go bye - especially on the weekends. Just walk around Trevor Square area and its a visual delight.My critical hotel comments - our room (607) was located on a corner of the building that has a busy street below; so the room is not quite before 1 am on a week night. Sunday was very quite. The two wall heaters in the room did not work, but room service brought a portable heater that worked nicely and a bed blanket. The bathroom vanity ceiling slowly leaked water onto the counter top several days in a row. Again room service was very appologetic and clened up the mess after each call.I would definately stay here again."
29,1151,"Mar 22 2009 	Superb Location	SPG Gold Member, so after much research (and Trip Advisor comparisons) I choose this hotel for 6 nights. My husband needed medical attention while were were there and the concierge and staff couldn't have been more helpful or concerned. They were GREAT (and my husband is fine now). Our King room was wonderful (though flat screen tv would have been nice and the small dresser was a little too small -- obviously not a complaint in any real way). 3 Tube stops (Knightsbridge, Sloane Sq and Hyde Park) are within 10 min walk. This is an expensive/upscale area so if rowdy pub-crawling is what you're looking for, look elsewhere. If however, you want a lovely, quiet adult atmosphere then look no further.As this was a vacation for us we didn't need to use wi-fi and the lobby pc was VERY inexpensive. Sometimes they have specials so 90 minutes was only 5 lbs. while we were there.We took the Picadilly line in from Heathrow and a cab back (early Sunday morning). The cab was 60lbs before tip but we were expecting that. It would easlity be near 100 lbs if it was during the week and lots of traffic. Tube travel super easy &amp; fast!We also advanced purchased, here in USA, the London Pass w/ additional unlimited Tube/Bus card which we used the heck out of. Made things so much easierIf you're used to NYC prices then currently London is not too expensive.All-in-all, an absolute delight of a holiday!I don't know the room rate as we used points. Would DEFINITELY stay here again."
30,1151,"Mar 18 2009 	Very good service to be a Sheraton	I've stayed there 4 times and like the personalized service. This property has a 5-star service and can't be compared with other sheratons. Nice location for buiness travellers, quiet area and close to knightbridge sub station. If you go for leisure and planning to sightsee London, the area isn't a good option but if you look for a upscale and quiet zone that's a great option.Room service menu limitted but food OK, nothing special. Reception staff is great."
31,1151,"Mar 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Located in a beautiful area, this hotel is made by its staff. Thank you Kelly and Jesse for making our 6 day stay perfect. We will definitely return and recommend this hotel as a London gem!"
32,1151,"Feb 25 2009 	A beautiful hotel	I was here just this last weekend and i have to say i have very few bad things to say about it!! They friendliness of the staff is next to none. They are so helpful. Freddie the Conceirge was so wonderful. He helped us so much. There was construction going on next door which woke me early, but that has nothing to do with the hotel!!The location is wonderful, with jus a short walk from Harrods and Knightsbridge tube station. Notwithstanding the closeness to Sloane Street with all the designer shopping like Christian Louboutin, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vitton and Gina to name but a few. There's a waitrose just around the corner too...for any shopping needs.The rooms are small but not squashed and the cleanliness of them is to the highest order. The only thing they didnt have was a tea and coffe making facility, which is surprising given they have everything else!! The food and drink there is also beautiful and reasonably priced. And ladies, Giseppie, the barman is an excellent cocktail maker! We had such fun.On a whole, we throughouly enjoyed our stay and will be returning and will also recommend it to anyone."
33,1151,"Feb 15 2009 	Just a fantastic hotel	I have literally just returned from a weekend staying at the Sheraton Belgravia and just wanted to let others know what a fantastic hotel this is. I have stayed in many inner city hotels which pale in comparison to this one. The rooms, whilst small as you would expect from an inner London hotel were immaculate and beautifully decorated. Despite their size you don't feel claustrophobic due to the carefully thought layouts, lighting and mirrors. For once, the rooms you see on the website are actually what you can expect, rather than a couple of carefully photographed &quot;suites&quot; which the average guest cannot expect to stay in.The staff were professional, friendly and helfpul throughout our stay and are a credit to the hospitality industry.The hotel was also wonderfully peaceful without feeling deserted.I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it."
34,1151,Feb 1 2009 	Superior Level of Service	We were very impressed and thankful for the high level of service and attention to personal detail from the staff of the hotel. A special compliment to the concierge who unfailingly delivered on every request and question we had. Rates were very attractive and we enjoyed a superior combination of business and holiday. They even stored our luggage for the week we were out of London.
35,1151,"Jan 17 2009 	Quiet Nice Hotel	Nice hotel, attentive front desk, concierge and staff. The room I got is quite small (especially the ver compact bathroom), but its clean, nicely decorated with comfortable bed. The hotel is very well located, walking distance to many attractions. The surrounding neighborhood is nice, safe and very clean. I walked late at nights and felt safe. I also like the hotels quiet and classy ambiance. For food, there is plenty of deli, cafes and pubs around, also an excellent Waitrose supermarket 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Compared to what I pay for US hotels, it is relatively expensive, especially the room is quite small. However, London hotels are expensive and the Sheraton Belgravia provided me a pleasant stay."
36,1151,"Jan 5 2009 	A gem of a hotel	We paid for two rooms with Starwood points. The staff couldn't be nicer. The reception is small but quite welcoming. Room service, maid service, concierge and valet all went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. Maybe it's because the hotel was not busy but this was just lovely.I do wish the wi fi was cheaper, tough. I know the hotel will say that these are competitive prices in all hotels in London, well that doesn't make it palatable, it just is a ridiculous sum to pay for daily internet access. Come on guys, instead of just following the gougers, set the trend and lower the price of wi-fi and in-room internet connections."
37,1151,"Dec 2 2008 	Satisfactory; very OK	I liked this hotel's location in Belgravia; wonderful for leisurely walks, especially down King's Road, close to Hyde and Green parks, within striking distance of Kensington museums. Even though it's not right at a tube station, the hotels not far from two of them (Knightsbridge and Sloane Square). As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is fairly compact and cozy, but my room was an ample size. I could, however, hear some things from the room next door; the walls are not so thin as to be acoustically transparent, but this is not the quietest place to stay. The carpets and furnishings and bath fixtures were rather worn (e.g. my desk chair was rickety and needed replacing) and so this hotel is in definite need of internal renovation. However, it seems a clean property and housekeeping was very good. Indeed, I really liked the staff at this hotel...they get things done and keep their promises within reasonable periods of time. Room service food is so-so and not the greatest value for money, but nowhere near the rip-off of the 18 pounds per day for the wireless Internet access (note: when you order the service, it says you are purchasing 24 hours, but they really mean until 11 a.m. every day...not the greatest deal if you check-in late...). There's a Waitrose grocery store nearby if you want to avoid hotel prices for food and drink, but don't look for any space to put things in the rooms mini-bar fridge, which is completely pre-stocked with items to make it impossible to store anything (without racking-up charges from the automatic 'robo-bar' in removing items to make room for anything purchased outside the hotel).Strangely for a hotel in Britain, my room did not include a tea set and water kettle, although these were provided when I asked for them. The bartender makes a great martini, it should be noted.Overall, I would say this hotel is best for a Starwood points redemption stay."
38,1151,"Nov 25 2008 	Great location but smaller than other Sheraton hotels	I had expected a lot from this hotel, but in some ways I was disappointed. If you have stayed at hotels in Paris then you will know exactly what this hotel is like - small and cramped. Reception, the bar, the lifts and the rooms are all smaller than you would expect in a 5-star central London Hotel. However, the hotel is lovely and the staff are helpful. I did have problems with two rooms before I was happy with a king size room on the 10th floor. To the hotel's credit the manager contacted me personally after my stay to apologise for the problems I had and I am happy with the outcome. The view was simply spectacular and I really appreciated having a small balcony which meant I could sleep with the window open getting fresh air rather than air filtered through an air conditioner. This combined with the ever-comfortable Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed made for a pleasant night."
39,1151,"Oct 6 2008	Nice Stay perfect location	The minors first:1.) the hotel, from outside, looks extremely ugly (70th concrete style)2.) the water supply in the room is noisy (own presure pump) but with good presure. But it needs some knowledge to be able to adjust the water temperature.3.) Internet (WiFi) is approx.  25,00But now the positive sides1.) the location is just exelent (quite but in walking distance to all the nice shops (Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci, Billionaire, Harolds...).2.) room of good size (we got an upgrade to the executive suite on the top floor)3.) Clean4.) Exelent staff service, especially the Concierges5.) High value for London ( 240/night weekend rate)Anyway, next time we wouldn't stay here again since nearby you've got better options with more style (but higher priced).The Sheraton Belgravia, from outside, is a very ugly 70th hotel - but located very nicely (shopping; relaxing...). Once you stepped inside"
40,1151,"Sep 24 2008 	Nice hotel	Location It is about a half mile walk to Tube stations. The immediate neighborhood is very posh, and while there are nice restaurants close by..but not much for a tourist Relatively clean room, with bland decor. Bathrooms were extremely small and had plumbing problems .Nice comfortable bed. Plumbing and bathroom were dated, and didn't work very well.The hotel was walking distance to Hyde Park, Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Sloan street, which had the most ridiculous shopping. Also, the Picadilly line is the train that services Heathrow, so you wont have to take a cab from the airport, which ran us about 55 GBPConceirge was good and helpful . Breakfast not great . Best thing was Conceirge and since my agent has booked a basic room , but they change my room at additional cost of 35 GBP for which they originally said 50 GBP . -----------------"
41,1151,"Sep 17 2008 	Great location sweet hotel.	We stayed at the Sheraton Belgravia for one night enroute from Italy to Canada. Staff were lovely and helped us check in and brought us tea as we were exhausted from the travel and looked the part! Our room was extremely tiny (much smaller than the ones posted by other travellers) but plush and clean. I was with a friend so we had two twin beds and could barely walk between the two. However, we had the best sleep of our travels at this hotel due to the lovely choice of pillows, down duvet, good air conditioning and great hot shower. The location is walking distance along Sloane St to shops along Knightsbridge - a 5-7 mins walk only. Not a lot of selection for restaurants or breakfast locations within this walk but once you reach Knightsbridge there are many choices.Buses along Sloane St are frequent and not too full. Take a bus south along Sloane St if you wish to reach Victoria Station and there are shops including a Marks and Spencer take out food shop and a great meat pie shop selling only 2-3 different types of meat pies - very yummy and may have been one of the best handpies i've ever eaten. We were able to stay at this hotel via points so i'm not sure if there would be better hotels at this pricepoint in this area. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
42,1151,"Aug 31 2008 	OK Hotel OK Value...	Short 1 night stay at Belgravia on business trip. Mostly booked to rack up an SPG stay.Location has plusses and minuses. It is about a half mile walk to Tube stations. The immediate neighborhood is very posh, and while there are nice restaurants close by...there are very few cheaper casual places. Waitrose grocery store is a nice plus, about 6 blocks away to the North. My limited interations with the staff were good. Very professional and friendly.Room was average sized for London (small anywhere else). Relatively clean room, with bland decor. Air conditioner unit in the room was very old, and largely ineffective. Luckily it was fairly cool outside and windows open a bit. However, I don't like taking that risk.... Nice comfortable bed. Tiny TV with poorly functioning remote. I would classify the wifi internet as only semi-high speed (and fully-high priced at 15 GBP). Plumbing and bathroom were dated, and didn't work very well.Overall, can't get too excited about this one...There are other hotels in this price range which seem to offer better, more updated rooms... Location is interesting, but a bit inconvenient for my purposes."
43,1151,"Aug 29 2008 	Nice Hotel Convenient Location	We stayed at the Shreaton Belgravia for 5 days and found its location to be perfect for seeing London. It's situated two blocks from the Knightsbridge stop on the Picadilly line in the affluent neighborhood of Belgravia. The area is very quiet and safe at night, but theres not a whole lot going on after dark in the way of nightlife. The hotel was walking distance to Hyde Park, Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Sloan street, which had the most ridiculous shopping. Also, the Picadilly line is the train that services Heathrow, so you wont have to take a cab from the airport, which ran us about $120 USD at the time. Doh! The hotel itself was nice and clean. Our room was very comfortable and had a view of the Park across the street. The couch under the window was a little busted, but we didnt seem to mind. We found the staff to be very pleasant. We called on the concierge several times while we were there and each time we found them to be extremely helpful. Even late at night! We called room service for breakfast once and it was quick and the food was very good with fresh coffee. Other than that, we didnt use any of the other facilities in the hotel.All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Belgravia and would recommend it to anyone."
44,1151,"Aug 28 2008 	surprisingly intimate	Stayed here for two nights on Starwood points and was pleasantly surprised at how intimate and tucked away it is. It's not like any other Sheraton I'd ever stayed in - it's understated, small, and as others have said it feels in many ways more like a B&amp;B than a international chain hotel. The Sheraton Park Tower is a couple of blocks away and is much more like what you'd expect from a Sheraton, if that's what you're really into.There's no fitness center though they'll give you a pass to the Park Tower gym. The lobby is tiny, with maybe 20 seats. The front desk is really just a desk. It's in a residential area (one of the most expensive in the world) though there are a few small boutique shops a few blocks away. Around the corner are a Waitrose, Starbucks, and Patisserie Valerie for food, if you want to avoid the expensive breakfast.The room was clean and quiet, though light shone through the crack at the bottom of the front door all night. I don't think many people were staying in the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. You can walk to Sloane Street and Harrod's, as well as the other Knightsbridge / Kensington attractions (V&amp;A Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal Albert Hall). The nearest tube stop is either Hyde Park Corner or Knightsbridge which are maybe 5 minutes away."
45,1151,"Aug 28 2008 	Nice Quiet Neighborhood	I stayed here for 5 nights from Aug. 7, 2008 with my husband for vacation. We have been to London three times and stayed in different places each time. As I read reviews about the hotel I was a little worried about it, and I understand why now. If you are one to be in the middle of it all, this is not your hotel. Belgravia is a posh area with many embassies, ritzy flats, and very high end cars. Its very expensive to eat in the area and at the hotel. I liked the B&amp;B aspect of the hotel, especially because London is such a busy city, its nice to return to a quieter place. Since it is smaller than many chains around town, they actually take the time to help you with questions. For example, my husband needs his morning Starbucks coffee. The lady working behind the front desk actually walked us outside and gave us turn by turn directions to the store. The next day, a different staff member gave us a map as he highlighted directions for us (I get lost easily). Sheraton Belgravia is definitely not in the heart of all the action. If you want local nightlife (pubs), youll have to explore a bit further from the hotel to find it. The tube stops for this hotel are a bit of a winding walk, but there are three within 10 minutes. If you do book this hotel, tell them you want a park view because the other side of the hotel is a street view, which is noisier, but not by much."
46,1151,"Aug 26 2008	Wonderful!	We stayed at the Sheraton Belgravia for 4 nights on Sheraton points. What a lovely hotel! There were four of us, two adults and two children so we were given a suite that was larger than we expected and very nicely appointed. We only ate breakfast at the hotel on our last morning because we wanted to experience as much of London as we could in our short stay. Breakfast was good but expensive. All meals in London were pretty expensive, so that wasn't out of the ordinary. The hotel is very centrally located and we could walk to Knightsbridge, Victoria Station, the Sloane tube stop and Buckingham Palace from there. We did a lot of walking. I highly recommend this hotel for its location and wonderful staff."
47,1151,"Aug 12 2008	Tucked Away	On a business trip and stayed here for a few days. It was a nice enough hotel. Service levels as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre. Breakfast was good. Although in Central London, it was tucked away and didn't feel to 'urban'."
48,1151,"Jul 23 2008 	Interesting Hotel	This hotel is where large hotel chain meets intimate B&amp;B. The only trouble is that it doesn't do either particularly well. I almost gave the hotel 4 stars but the service was just average so I ended up with 3 stars. There are very good things at this hotel...1. Rooms are clean and fairly well adorned2. Location is quiet (could be good or bad depending on your view)3. The setting is intimate4. Good location for walking to some interesting spots (Harrod's, embassy row, etc)The not so good1. No real amenities (fitness room, etc)2. Food is outrageously expensive--although not completely out of line for London (bkfst buffett is 21 Bp or $42)The hardest thing to poinpoint was the service. It is interesting to check-in to a Sheraton where there is no front desk..just a person sitting at a small desk (this is the B&amp;B aspect). There are always more than enough people to help you--but they sort of have the large hotel chain attitude. Pleasant but not personal. When you stay at a B&amp;B or 5 star hotel, you get that special intimate treatment. Here you expect it and while everyone is pleasant, they lack that passion for service. Kind of hard to explain but hopefully you get the point.In summary, I would stay here again if traveling with my wife (only--no kids) and/or I wanted something off the beaten track. I personally like more amenities for the price."
49,1151,"Jul 20 2008 	Mediocre	This is a mediocre mid-range hotel in central London (by mid-range, I mean about $425 per night, which is mid-range in London). It is vastly overpriced and underserviced by American standards. Although it is in Belgravia, which is supposedly a &quot;quiet&quot; neighborhood, the hotel is on a very noisy street and the windows do virtually nothing to keep out the noise. Light sleepers should choose another hotel. I was fortunate enough to have sufficient Starwood points for the room and thus avoided the regular (ridiculous) price. We were upgraded to an &quot;executive room&quot; at check-in, which was nice of them, but the room was overstuffed with furniture and was around 300 sq. feet, including the bathroom (which was small). The rooms are laid out in typical London townhouse style, which means that our door-slamming neighbor's door and the maid's door (which slammed constantly from about 8 a.m. onward) were right next to ours. From a noise standpoint, this hotel was not a good experience. Staff at the hotel, from concierge to maids, was indifferent. Continental breakfast was 18 pounds sterling ($36); we did not partake. For American readers, you would be happier and more comfortable at a Holiday Inn Express at a quarter of the price in the U.S. Which leads to the question of where one should stay in London, a wonderful city but one in which probably 95% of the hotels priced under $500 per night are bad or worse (I base this on 14 trips there and 14 different hotels). If I hadn't been using frequent guest points, I would have gone to the Bentley Kempinski in South Kensington, where we stayed two years ago. It's at least two cuts above the Sheraton Belgravia and is about the same price. It's not perfect either, but it's a great value for London."
50,1151,"Jul 18 2008 	Nice hotel in a good location	I had a layover in London as part of a journey to Egypt, so thought I might as well spend a night in the city and do some sightseeing. London is expensive for hotels, so I used Starpoints for a free night at the Sheraton Belgravia. I chose the hotel based on it's good location but lower price (in terms of points) than other Starwood properties.Location: The hotel is in what is probably the wealthiest part of London. Very clean and upscale street with many embassies nearby. It's a relatively quick walk to Buckingham Palace, although I walked all the way to the Tate Modern (bearing in mind that I enjoy exploring cities on foot and this took me over an hour!). The hotel is not particularly close to the tubes but there are several stops within a 5-10 minute walking radius (Sloane Square and Knightsbridge are about equidistant from the hotel, depending on which lines you want). I thought the location was good, but if you want to be right in the middle of the action this hotel isn't for you. There's also not much in the way of restaurants in the immediate vicinity but there's plenty within a short walk. The hotel is also close to great shopping, including Harrods.Reception: Had the usual early morning arrival so I couldn't check into my room until 3pm. No problem, they took my luggage and I came back later for the key. I'll say though that the reception wasn't particularly warm - especially after seeing me in shorts and bleary-eyed after a long overnight flight. Overall I got a somewhat snooty vibe from reception, which isn't forgivable but is at least understandable given the upscale address and clientele.Room: The room was good sized, and the bed was super comfy. Good sized bathroom and the AC worked well (which was important because it was in the 80s when I was there). Overall no complaints about the room whatsoever - it was a standard Sheraton-type room but did have a bit of local character.Service: I didn't use any of the hotel restaurants or room service since I was only there a night, but I think you'd do better elsewhere (especially if on a budget).Overall: I'd stay here again in a similar situation. The hotel was clean, in a reasonable location, and was relaxing after a day of heavy walking and sightseeing. With the points I paid, I think it was a good deal, but beware that it would have been over $500 a night if I'd paid out of pocket. In my opinion it certainly isn't worth that much! Regardless, this is a good choice for tourists in London."
51,1151,"Jul 15 2008	Amazing!	First trip to England and picked the pefect hotel.Location was ideal - walking distance from Victoria Station, Buckingham Palace, Harrods, shopping, attractions, restaurants and more.... all in a safe, upper class neighbourhood.Service was second to none - it was great to sit down at the registration and have a nice cold drink after a very long flight. Our luggage was delivered to our room while we checked in. Concierge went out of their way to assist. As a smaller hotel, the personal service they are able to offer was fantastic.The hotel itself was amazing....love the private little nooks off the lobby for a quiet tea, or full meal. Rooms were suprisingly larger than I anticipated for a classic hotel in England - and fully equipped with everything you need while travelling.Recommend this hotel to all!"
52,1151,"Jul 10 2008 	Nice stay at Sheraton Belgravia	We enjoyed our vacation stay at the Sheraton Belgravia. The hotel is very convenient to major London sites as well as Tube stops. Its an easy walk to Victoria station, and not much further to Buckingham palace. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, especially when we needed help finding a restaurant or needed directions to an attraction. Overall, we would gladly return."
53,1151,"Jul 3 2008 	A Real Gem	We stayed at this lovely hotel for several days in June. The location was a short walk to Harrods, Buckingham Palace, Victoria Station, etc. The room was extremely clean with comfortable beds. All the staff were polite and friendly. Check-in was easy and quick and it was nice to sit with a complimentary drink while doing so. Perfect atmosphere for a lovely stay in London. Would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone."
54,1151,"Jun 29 2008 	Old and worn but great location	We stayed at this property for two nights following a trip to France. The location was great and in a very nice &amp; safe neighborhood but the hotel was definitely showing signs of age. We were upgraded to a junior suite on the 9th floor. It was large and comfortable but the furnishings and decor were a bit outdated. The windows also created a howling noise when the wind blew - they were not air tight. The bathroom was large, but fixtures need to be updated. There were places on the walls that needed re-painting, re-wallpapering etc. The service was good and they did send someone up almost immediately to try to fix the window situation. In sum, a comfortable hotel in a great location but in need of some renovations."
55,1151,"Jun 13 2008 	Great hotel in a great location!	This is a great little hotel in an amazing neighborhood. The check-in with Angelo was smooth, relaxing and fun as we sipped on our wine at a table in the lobby. The hotel is clean and well-appointed and the staff are all professional, efficient and eager to help. We travelled with our daughters and had two rooms, and both were upgraded as a Starward points member. Special kudos to Gregors who tried patiently to assist us with theatre tickets. We saw &quot;Wicked&quot; and was wowed by the show and talent. Thanks for making that happen for us Gregor, you are terrific! Especially go to the Patisserie Valerie, a five minute walk, for daily breakfast treats including various croissants, danish and muffins. These were some of the best deals in London at a price of about $3.00 a piece!! We all loved this homey, warm hotel and exceptional staff. We would definately stay there again. Thanks to all who made our stay in London very memorable, and especially Angelo and Gregor."
56,1151,"May 30 2008	Excellent location	I went to London for a long weekend with friends and chose this hotel for the location, which is wonderful. An easy 5 minute walk (or 5 taxi ride) to Victoria Train Station, Knightsbridge tube, or Harrod's. The immediate neighborhood also has great restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores.We were in an executive suite, which by London standards was outright huge. Everything was in great working order and immaculate. I'm docking one star for several small hiccups in the experience: we booked with points and there was some mix-up about a pre-arranged upgrade (although, this may have been an issue with SPG, not the hotel), we had to ask for our roll-away cot several times before it showed, Molton Brown is no longer used (update the pictures on the website!), and upon leaving the property, we asked the woman at the desk if we needed to formally check-out and all we got was a dismissive wave. I think she meant it as a &quot;no, you don't need to check out,&quot; but it was a rather abrupt send-off. Overall, however, the service was generally courteous and friendly, the hotel beautiful (the interior only, the exterior is stuck in the 70's), and the location was exactly what we wanted."
57,1151,"May 28 2008 	A neat and clean little hotel	My wife and I just returned from a trip to London, where we stayed at the Sheraton Belgravia for 4 nights. I really cannot comment on the value, as I used Starwood points to book my stay. I think this hotel is normally in the 200 - 400 pound per night range, which seems a bit high, (especially for US travelers), but I really do not have much to compare with. The service at this property was excellent. All staff that we encountered were extremely helpful, polite, and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. The room itself was a bit small (somewhat typical of London). If the room and bathroom both had another 50 - 100 sqaure feet, they would have been perfect! I will say that the room was VERY well maintained. Every detail (bathroom grout, tile, carpeting, walls, trim moulding, etc) was in excellent condition. The only complaint was that our window had a broken seal, and constantly had condensation, blocking our view. The only other complaint is that the walls of our room adjoined with a service closet and our neighbors closet, and we could hear everything every time someone hung something up in the closet, or opened and closed the door. We had a few drinks in the downstairs bar, which were very good. The location of this hotel is excellent - very close to Knightsbridge, Sloane Street and Sloane Square Shopping, as well as tube stops and Hyde Park. While the hotel is not much to look at from the outside, it really delivers on the inside. One bit of feedback to Sheraton: Your high speed internet fees are highway robbery! It was around 18.00 pounds for 24 hours of service. This is insane, given that most hotels, shops, cafes, etc all over free WiFi."
58,1151,"May 23 2008 	Really Good	I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton Belgravia. The hotel is really cosy and warm; I usually love it during Christmas time. Anyways, as for the rates of the rooms, they are very competitive for their location. You are getting a bargain compared to neighbouring hotels within the Knightsbridge and Chelsea area. However, as this was my fourth stay at the hotel and being a Platinum Starwood Preferred Guest member, I didn't receive my upgrade, welcome amenity and so on. I had to ask for it, which I found odd. This was probably the only let down, to me personally as I've received a much better and welcoming service when I was a Gold and Classic member. Putting all that aside, I highly recommend this hotel for its location, price and service (the concierge was a great help)."
59,1151,"May 8 2008 	lovely hotel	We spent two nights here (booked with Starwood points). Everything was very nice, the staff was excellent and so was the service--felt more upscale than many Sheratons I have stayed in. My wife left her engagement ring and diamond earrings in the room and we didn't realize it until we were checked out and heading to heathrow on the underground. I called the hotel -- by the time we'd gotten back they had the jewelry waitnig for us in a velvet bag and a cab waiting to race us back to the airport. Great hotel."
60,1151,"Apr 18 2008 	Great Location lovely rooms	We had a wonderful stay at the Belgravia. I can't comment on the value of the rooms, as we booked using Starwood points, but the room was large with a nice sitting area and big bathroom. The bed was super comfy, which was a big plus. The staff was friendly and helpful, though we never did receive the water they were supposedly sending at check-in. The hotel is located in a nice area, though there isn't much directly around it. It's a short walk to Harrod's and the Knightsbridge Tube station."
61,1151,"Apr 17 2008 	Great London Hotel; Quiet and Right in the heart of things 4.5 Stars	The Sheraton Belgravia exceeded our expectations. A very friendly staff. Great part of town and very quiet for a London hotel. Will be back. 80 rooms is the perfect size and we enjoyed the coffee bar, had a nice lunch. Multiple restaurants nearby as is a Waitrose for those concerned about the Dollar's lack of purchasing power."
62,1151,"Feb 16 2008 	Convenient comfortable and quiet hotel in central London	Redeemed 2 rooms for a night in Feb 2008. Requested early check in (around 8 am) and interconnecting rooms as I was travelling with my wife + 2 children. Called the hotel 2 days early to ask if these could be met - no promises of course, but I was told they weren't full so there was a good probability. They did and helped make our one day stopover in London a lot more comfortable than it might have been. I have stayed in this hotel once or twice a year for the last few years on business trips, and it has maintained its quiet, unfussy and comfortable character. Convenient location &lt;10 mins walk to Harrods and Knightsbridge tube station. Cab rank outside the door for taxis. Very quiet. Unobtrusive but good service. Comfortable rooms and beds with duvets, tasteful decor that blends modern and older styles - you won't feel like you're in an impersonal chain hotel room. Modern bathrooms with plumbing that works well. Good heating system - neither too hot nor too cold. If you are a traveller who needs a good quality room in central London away from the horde without breaking the bank, this is definitely the hotel to go for."
63,1151,"Feb 7 2008 	Boutique style property	5 x night stay using Starwood Point redemption.Check in: Greeted in a friendly manner by concierge, offered a choice of welcome drink.Early arrival, after a 10 min stroll from Victoria Station. Room was not ready, so left bags and headed out.This was my first stay at this Hotel, and although as a Londoner, I knew the area, I took the opportunity of orienting myself with grocery store, Starbucks, Tube station etc. Waitrose supermarket one block away...somewhat hidden. Always buy your own room swag...fruit, water, snack items etcAlert: Currently everything costs 25% - 35% more than the US.Lobby and common areas: Small, low ceilings, darkish, slight feeling of claustrophobia pervades this entire property. I found it disquieting, but got used to it after a couple of days. Room: Jr Suite on 9th floor, which is a larger (by London standards) corner room, with a sofa(bed) and chair sitting area, work desk etc. Bed was a Sheraton Sweet Sleeper....comfortable, with fairly high quality bedding. Wifi: Purchased one week of Hotel access for $72 US. Dear Sheraton, 11mbps is not broadband !!This Hotel is not hi-tech or modern. It positions itself as a period boutique property, so expect period (dated) furnishings and funky regency style upholstered chairs and furniture that would not be out of place in an 80's US Holiday Inn. Not my thing.TV was awful. Old CRT monster, dodgy remote that had to be replaced, channels awkward, very poor selection for an international Hotel.Bathroom: Campy marblish affair, small, and barely adequate. Gym: Available at the Sheraton Tower Hotel 4 mins away on Knightsbridge. Small room, good equipment, 4 persons fills it. Nice individual shower rooms.Water, apples, and towels freely available. Get a key card from reception on your way out.Neighborhood: Upscale Belgravia. Knightsbridge is 5 mins away as is Hyde Park Corner. Lunch at the Harvey Nichols rooftop restaurant, always a treat.Harrods is an easy walk if that floats your boat. Great museums are close by in Kensington. Safety factor: 8/10London Travel: Get the OYSTER Card for overseas visitors. Only available at gateway airports. Heathrow / Gatwick etcCost 12 pounds - 2 pounds for the card and preloaded with 10 pounds to get you going. Don't even think about buying individual tube / bus tickets unless your name is Bill Gates.US Rating: 4* would be a stretchStay again? No."
64,1151,"Jan 4 2008 	Good London Hotel	As I often travel to London on business I have stayed several times at this hotel. The location is really great for getting around Central London. I good example is that you can take a short but pleasant walk to Victoria for the Gatwick Express. The staff are always polite and discreet. The rooms are well decorated and comfortable with nice bathrooms. The main reason I go back to this hotel is the consistency of the service. It's always good. They are quick and discreet, possibly a bit formal for some people's taste but I like the efficiency of it all. The thing to look out for with this hotel is that the price fluctuates like crazy. You can pay as little as 99.00 GBP per night up to 350.00 GBP. They are close to a lot of the exhibition centres and when there is a big show on the price of the room becomes ridiculous. If you are quoted more than 200.00 GBP a night when you are booking I recommend you try the Sheraton Park Lane which is very similar but usually a bit cheaper."
65,1151,"Dec 17 2007 	Wonderful London Hotel	First off, I have to say that the service received during my week-long stay at the Sheraton Belgravia was second to none. I spend many nights in hotel rooms every year (including many 5-star, high-end hotels) and can't think of any hotel at which I received better service than the Sheraton Belgravia. Staff was always friendly and attentive, and no task was too big or small for any of the staff. Rather than pass duties off to other staffmembers or make you wait until someone whose job description covers your request is around and available, I found that everyone who worked here was ready and willing to attend to whatever came up, right away, so that I never found myself waiting or wanting and never had to ask for anything twice. We arrived in London quite early in the morning, and so arrived at the hotel well before standard check-in time. Despite this, they readily had a room (Executive Room) available for us to rest and relax in after our long trip over from FL. Further, they upgraded us (on account of my Starwood Preferred Guest status) to a Studio Suite for the remaining 6 days of our stay. The staff happily (and literally within 2 minutes of my calling downstairs to ask) provided me with 2 power adaptors when one of mine blew a fuse. They also offered to move our bags from our old room to our new room, as well as bring up our keys to the new room, the day we were upgraded as we planned to be out and about and doing touristy things that day. Again, going out of their way to be helpful. In fact, once while stepping out of the hotel on our first day I asked the concierge if taxis regularly park and make themselves available outside of the hotel (on this first occasion of stepping out, we saw no taxis. But after that, there were regularly 1 or 2 black taxis in front of the hotel ready for anyone who might need them). I only wanted to know if taxis made a habit of waiting outside, but the concierge eagerly got up from his desk and ran outside in to the cold air to chase down a taxi for us, as if answering the question alone wasn't enough and nothing mattered to him, at that moment, more than our getting a taxi! I felt guilty, but very thankful! hehe.Studio Suite was very spacious and comfortable. Large bathroom with plenty of countertop space, minibar, king bed, sitting area with sofa and chair, work desk, wireless high speed internet, 24hr room service, and other conveniences. Very tastefully decorated and furnished. Some of the furnishings look old, but on closer inspection they're just old fashioned and traditional. No damage or scuff marks or anything like that, and everything was in good shape and good working order. The one time our TV stopped working (most likely because we decided to try and move it around a little), a staff member was at our door less than 5 minutes after calling downstairs and the TV was fixed. There are plenty of outlets around for laptops, cellphone chargers, etc. There was always plenty of hot water, with great water pressure. Climate controls in the room worked well and were easy to operate. The feel of the entire room was very cozy, comfortable, and welcoming. It was a very nice place to come home to after long days sightseeing, shopping, etc.The hotel was extremely convenient to area attractions, tube stations and such. It was only a 10 minute walk to Harrods and the shops in Knightsbridge; just a few minutes walk from Sloan St; no more than 10 to 15 minutes to the undergrounds at Sloane Square, Knightsbridge, Hyde Park Corner, and Victoria Station so you're never far from the Circle, District, or Piccadilly lines. It's also within short walking distance to Buckingham Palace, many West End theatres, wonderful parks, and more. Further, the Belgravia area itself is beautiful and a very charming part of London (indeed, a very London part of London). Some of the common areas of the hotel may seem a bit small (ceilings somewhat low, small elevators, hallways somewhat narrow) but not to a degree that is the least bit inconvenient or even awkward, I found. Instead, I found the entire place to be very cozy and comfortable and the 2 rooms we saw and spend some time in very spacious. I would not hesitate to stay at the Sheraton Belgravia again, and in fact would make a reservation eagerly. I see this hotel as being my home base when in London for years to come, so long as things remain as they were during my stay with great facilities and staff. All this at a price I found to be extremely reasonable, worthwhile, and even quite competitive if not clearly more affordable than many similar area hotels."
66,1151,"Dec 10 2007 	Very nice hotel excellent location and value	We recently stayed at the Sheraton Belgravia for 3 nights (Nov. 16-19) and used Starwood points. It was the second year in a row that I have stayed here and I think it is a great hotel in a great location. It seems to be the smaller, less expensive sister to the Sheraton Park Tower Hotel about 2 blocks away. The Sheraton Belgravia is easily walkable to Harrods, Knightsbridge Tube Stop, Sloane Sq. etc... There is also a nice supermarket (Waitrose) about a 10 minute walk away in one of the neighboring &quot;Crescents&quot; so that made it easy to have an evening drink/snack in the room before going out. The hotel staff was very accomodating and helpful. We were offered complimentary cappucinos upon arrival. It was no problem when we asked for a coffee maker for our room, or for the hotel mini bar to be emptied so that we could put our own food in there. Our room was large and spacious, and was decorated in nice autmnal colors such as russet and dark green. There was a nice throw rug on the foot of our bed and even a Sheraton Teddy Bear..Finally, for exercise fanatics, use of the gym facilities at the nearby Sheraton Park Tower was complimentary as the Sheraton Belgravia does not have its own gym. I am a picky traveler and would have no hesitation recommending the Sheraton Belgravia to anyone. I would definitely stay there again!"
67,1151,"Sep 30 2007	Good service	Stayed at this hotel a few times, once several years ago and another in July this year. The building is rather old and it is not one of the most glamourous hotels in London, however, I find receptionist/porters very professional and friendly, which is not too common in London hotels. Rooms are small but that is normally the case in London,thus, it should not be considered too negative. If the traveller wishes to spend time shopping in Sloane area as well as at Harrods, this hotels is located very conveniently. Also the access to the centres is very easy too. Did not dine at the restaurant and I find the bar rather depressing (but there are so many other bars you can go in the areas, so it does not really matter) but the room service breakfast was excellent."
68,1151,"Sep 29 2007	Loved it	My mother (75) and I went to London for a five day get-away and chose this hotel for the location and in hopes of a Starwood special member upgrade. This is a boutique hotel with a home-like but sophisticated atmosphere in a very high end neighborhood. I've never seen more Bentley's, Jags, Mercedes, BMW' and even a Maybach as in this neighborhood. We got upgraded to a suite (2 rooms) and were pleased. The furnishing was traditional and used (as is the interior of Buckingham palace and most things British) but clean and very comfortable. It looked just like some of the pictures shown here. The bed was super and the bathroom like new. The location is great and we saved money on taxis by staying here because it is so close to some of the major attractions and Victoria Station.The service and friendliness of the hotel staff was just wonderful. I have stayed at several Ritz Carlton's with a much lower level of service. Everyone was very helpful and nice, from the concierge (all three), to the reception, the maid service and the restaurant. Upon arrival we were even brought tea and a biscuit in the lobby while we waited for our room to be readied. Every time we asked for anything, we were almost immediately satisfied. We ate in a nearby pub in one of the many Mews (alleys) that are in the area. Very cool. Waitrose is a grocery store a couple blocks away and we put some food in our mini bar refrigerator. We had a great trip and much of the reason was our pleasant stay at the Sheraton Belgravia."
69,1151,"Aug 28 2007 	Miss the breakfast!	Nicely located for a weekend break in central west London.But, it is a bit of an over priced old dame in flashy dress!Miss the breakfast. It is overpriced and terrible. Go to the Costa, by Waitrose, just a stroll away."
70,1151,"Aug 12 2007 	We'll be back	Had a simply wonderful weekend in London last week; weather was stunning and I'm pleased to report that our first stay at the Sheraton Belgravia added immesurably to our overall experience.Bit of a scratched record here I'm afraid; most of what I want to say has been said before by the growing numbers of those others who also loved their visit to the Belgravia.Suffice it to say that the location of the hotel is sublime - one can take a leisurely stroll to many attractions (we ambled to Charing Cross/ Covent Garden via Buckingham Palace, St. James's Park, Wellington Arch etc) in about 40 mins. Sloane Square tube station is around 10 mins from the hotel and add another 5 mins max to get to Brompton Road for some fab shopping (Harrods, Harvey Nichols etc).Price wise, of course the hotel is not cheap but I didn't find the prices to be as over-inflated as in some other Sheratons that i have visited, which is a little surprising considering that it's address is in one of the most exclusive neighbourhoods, well, in the world actually....Service is the real key here though. Check in (with Robin and Angelo) was a joy, with the oft-time mentioned complimentary tipple from the bar. Both of these highly professional and genuinely friendly gentlemen continued to be of great help to us over the weekend stay and are a credit to the Starwood brand.A special mention must also go to the Food and Beverage Manager, Stuart, who attended to us over breakfast on our last morning, arranged for our luggage to be held while we went shopping (we had a late flight) and invited us back for a pre-departure Bellini on the house. He also advised us as to our best course of attack in trying to get to the airport during rush-hour. Without such advice, we'd probably still be sitting in a taxi stuck in the hell that london traffic can be...The bottom line for me in any hotel/restaurant/bar scenario is service - good service allows for any number of other sins where the reverse, in my mind, cannot be said. Sheraton Belgravia delivers service, along with the rest of the overall product, in spades. We'll definitely be going back...."
71,1151,"Jul 31 2007 	Boutique hotel in one of the most elegant residential neighborhoods in London	I just returned from 3 nights at the Sheraton Belgravia. This is not your typical Sheraton as it is small, intimate and lacking some of the big hotel amenities. In exchange, you are staying in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the world next to embassies and incredbile townhouses. The neighborhood bistros and markets are charming and close. You do not feel like a tourist, and frankly you do not see many tourists. The only downside to the hotel, was that the staff seemed to not know where the nearest markets and bistros were. They were not unhelpful, just did not know. There is a Marks and Spencer Market ( affordable food for breakfasts and snacks) right down the street towards Brompten Street (by Harrods). Harrods is a 10 minute walk as is Harvey Nichols. There is also a Waitrose market just three minutes away: 27 Motcomb Street. There is a great bistro across from it with a patio for breakfast or lunch. From the hoteI it is an easy walk to Victoria Station (without luggage) and to Buckingham Palace. I would not say that the tubes are convenient to this hotel. The lighting in the bathrooms is great and the rooms feel warm and elegant with antiques. Upon check in you sit down at a desk and are served drinks. The rooms are not huge, but adequate. The beds are comfortable with duvets. It is a quirky hotel, but lovely. This hotel is a little jewel."
72,1151,"Jul 30 2007 	Great location charming hotel	My spouse and I spent a great weekend at the Sheraton Belgravia. We thoroughly appreciated the great location --nestled in a wonderful neighborhood, and within walking distance of so many of the things we wanted to see and do. We had previously been staying at a larger business hotel, but switched to the Belgravia for the weekend for the more intimate feel and further isolation from the city's crowds. While the room and bathroom were smallish, I found them absolutely fine for European (and also NYC) standards. And, the cozy layout actually builds upon the intimate nature of the space.My only complaint (and it's not major) concerns noise. The elevator (near to our room) let out a high-pitched squeal whenever it went by. In addition, when we tried to use the AC to drown out that noise, we noticed that the old machine let out an even worse sound that actually woke us up at night. So, we had no choice but to turn it off. Outside noise was no problem at all -- it was just the internal noises of other guests and building infrastructure that caused us any troubles.These noise issues would not keep us from returning again (although I might ask for a room further away from the elevator). We had a delightful time in London, and our accommodations generally only added to the experience."
73,1151,"Jul 23 2007 	Fantastic London Neighborhood	I enjoyed three nights at this hotel in May, 2007. As suggested by many reviews, the surrounding neighborhood is idyllic with many great restaurants and pubs, as well as (expensive) shopping. The hotel is dated, especially the gloomy lobby, but the room quality is superb. Location is exceptionally quiet and is convenient to the Sloane Square tube stop.Avoid the wildly overpriced breakfast, and take a short walk around Sloane Square for some much better options."
74,1151,"Jul 17 2007 	Fantastic hotel Great Location clean well kept	Although this hotel is a wee bit outdated, its well kept, the bed was huge, the bathroom very nice, the staff excellent. The Bar downstairs was very nice and attentive. This hotel is located not too far from Harvey Nics and Harrods and Sloan Avenue."
75,1151,"Jul 13 2007	Smart Business Hotel	I'd not stayed at the Sheraton Belgravia for about 2 years, but it still retains a calm business presence. I'd heard it had been closed for a year for a refurb, but it looked just as I'd last stayed. My room was upgraded to an executive it was smart , reasonably spacious for London but the bathroom was faded for a 5*....it was all spotless though. Check-in was frustratingly slow as I had to wait over 3 minutes as there isn't really a check-in desk....more a boutique table......this was bad on a hot day when I was in a hurry. Check-out was swift and excellent. I would stay here again though."
76,1151,"Jun 18 2007 	Belgravia - Very nice!	London hotels being very expensive (London in general as a matter of fact) I picked the Belgravia for a two night business trip because it seemed like a decent value.I was very happy with my choice. The room was large clean and comfortable with a balcony I could actually step out on, in a very nice section of town. I had great service and decent food. I would definitely repeat.Paddington station (and the Heathrow Express) is a ten minute cab ride away and Knightsbridge Underground station (Harrod's)is a five minute walk, so the hotel is conveniently located."
77,1151,"May 3 2007 	Beautiful Quiet residential area and wonderful staff	NOTE: This review is written from a Tourist perspectiveThis is a very nice and welcoming hotel in a beautiful area of the city. Outside our window we had a view of a small park and views of a very nice area of the Belgravia section of London. I stayed at the Sheraton Park Tower (about  mile away right on busy Knightsbridge road) and I prefer the Sheraton Belgravia because it is in nice quiet neighborhood, the rooms are larger and more comfortable and the hotel is generally more welcoming. The staff at this hotel was the friendliest I have come across in a very long time. Instead of a format front desk, you are welcomed at a desk where you sit across from the person checking you in. This is a small hotel with only 18 rooms, but the rooms are relatively large and spacious. They gave us a free drink coupon which we used for toast and coffee for breakfast instead.Within a short walk are many of the attractions that a tourist might want to see: Hyde Park, Kensington Palace. The area that the Sheraton Belgravia is in is one of the most expensive areas of London and the price reflects the upscale areas cost. Just a few blocks from the hotel there are plenty of stores, delis and restaurants. There is a Marks and Spenser food store, a Waitrose food store (lower cost than Marks and Spenser) , Spaghetti House (Excellent sauceabout 45 for a meal for two), an excellent casual Lebanese restaurant and deli (Noura Brasserie) and Harrods (the over priced tourist trap, IMHO) is a short walk away. There is also a casual Japanese basement restaurant which I highly recommend, downstairs just below Harvey Nichols at the corner of Seville and Knightsbridge Road.The hotel is a brief walk from Victoria station (good shopping!), Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, St James Park, Buckingham Palace, many Embassies including the US embassy, the Victoria and Albert Museum (highly recommended!). The Imperial War Museum and London Eye and are a short tube ride away as is Westminster abbey and the Tower of London.There is also a walk on/walk off bus that you can catch over by the Park Lane side of Hyde Park (near Marble Arch) across from the London Hilton: excellent value for your money! In addition to the bus ride, a number of walking tours are included in the $40.00 price: We took the changing of the Guard tour and the Beatles tour and we felt we got excellent value for our money. We particularly enjoyed the very courteous and personable staff of the bus company (it is called the Big Bus Company)Just ask the very kind and considerate hotel staff of the Sheraton Belgravia and they will gladly direct you to the local attractions."
78,1151,"Apr 11 2007 	Attentive staff but not really good value	Due to the location of this hotel, in one of Londons premium areas, it is a very expensive hotel to stay in usually. I am not sure that it is good value for money, even if cost is not a big issue for you as it is not particularly attractive and lacks many features (such as a health club, variety of bars and restaurants etc).It is, though, in a fabulous location close to Sloane Street, Knightsbridge and the Kings Road. So fabulous if you like shopping!The Staff at the hotel is all very helpful, friendly and attentive. This perfectly fits the premium nature and rates of the hotel. I was, for example, staying at the hotel for a few days for a work meeting and even at a conference deal of 215 (about US$430) for a standard room. I was though, as I am a Starwood Gold Card holder, upgraded to a Junior Suite. This room on the 7th floor was lovely with 3 large windows looking across the rooftops of London towards the London Eye (bearing in mind buildings are not very tall in London!).The design and fixtures in the room were traditional but stylish, with a sort of country house look. The bathroom had Molton Brown toiletries and complimentary wireless access for the duration of your stay. They give you cards with a code for each day when you check in.As I mentioned, there is no fitness centre in the hotel, which is an issue I think considering the cost and premium of the hotel. You can go up the road to a sister hotel but when on business you dont have the time to head off to another hotel and do a workout as well usually! There is a pleasant but small breakfast buffet in the bar that was pretty good.The rooms were a little noisy due to the location and the nature of the building, which is a rather ugly building that I think may have been built in the late 1960s or 1970s, which seemed to lack good soundproof windows.I sound like I am negative on the hotel but I enjoy staying here as they did make you feel important and were attentive. I just dont think the hotel rooms are worth the money, and I am unlikely to stay here again if I was choosing a hotel to stay at in the area."
79,1151,"Dec 27 2006 	Perfectly Convenient and Amazing Service	What a fantastic time I had when I went to London from December 14th-19th. After a hectic flight with some delays, I was glad to finally get to the hotel!This is one gorgeous little boutique hotel. It has the Sheraton service and amenities that we've come to expect. I arrived all exhausted and was greeted with big smiles. They have a sit down check-in which adds a lovely touch! You also get a free complimentary beverage while you are checking in to the hotel. You can get champagne, wine, hard liquor, sparkling water, soda, or juice! I've found this Sheraton to be a hundred times better than the Sheraton at Heathrow, it's just too noisy.The staff were really friendly and always willing to help. They also gave great expensive and inexpensive recommendations for dining and places to go. The Belgravia aream which the hotel is located, is absolutely gorgeous. This is where a lot of the wealthiest people in London live and is around the corner from Sloane Street which is the shopping mecca of London. You are only a 5-8 minute walk from the Knightsbridge Tube Station, as well as Victoria Sq where you can pick up the original hop on-off tour but let me tell you, there is this fantastic french bakery called Patisserie Valerie and you have to go out and get one of their Ham and Cheese danishes. Oh my lord, they are fresh out of the oven, piping hot with high quality italian hams and melted fontina cheese. Top of off with a cappuccino and you're in heaven. I know, I'm digressing a little but the walk to the tube was pleasant because it's a gorgeous area.The food was excellent at the hotel and was fairly priced. To me, I live in Boston so I'm used to paying a lot of money for food but I don't think 9 pounds was a bit extreme for a burger, fries and salad. Technically $9 to us in the states is 9 pounds to someone in England, but it's $18.00 to us with the conversion but you can't think like that in London or you'll have a miserable time. haha. The rooms were well kept and the bathroom was small, but really clean and pretty. I loved the deep tubs! The beds are super comfortable and the channels on tv were pretty fair. The only negative thing I have for the hotel is that the elevators are TINY. You can fit maybe 2 people in them with 2 little travel suitcases, nothing more than that. If you are a family of 4 you'll have to separate into two separate elevators and make several trips if you have lots of luggage. Other than that, this hotel is fabulous and I would definitely stay again!"
80,1151,"Mar 27 2006 	Nice but a bit tired	I stayed at this hotel for five nights on a business trip in March 2006. It is reasonably well located in Belgravia and only about 10 minutes walk from a number of tube stations, and some of the shops like Harrods and Harvey Nichols.The lobby area is small and a bit cramped. There is no ramp and so you need to go down about three stairs to be able to check in. It is all a bit unwieldy if you have heavy bags. Check-in was quite smooth. I had a room on the third floor, which basically was in line with the rooftops and so there was no real view. My colleague had a room on the ninth floor which apparently had a much better view. The room was reasonably sized and quite comfortable. The desk was one of those small English desks with lots of nice carved wood underneath that I kept banging my knees on. Very impractical! There are not many television channels to choose from, but this is not that uncommon in the UK. The bed was a king size bed but it was two single beds put together. This did not cause me any problems. The bathroom was fine although perhaps a little on the small side. Again, this is not that uncommon in UK hotels. The shower worked fine. Access to the Internet was via a wireless connection that worked quite well. It was relatively expensive on a per day basis, so I bought the seven day package for GBP38.We had breakfast each morning in the hotel which was downstairs in a small corridor like room. There was not a great deal of choice on the buffet and some of the food needed replenishing more quickly than they topped it up. The service was quite good. I had room service a couple of times and it was a bit mixed. One meal was quite good but the other one was a bit disappointing. Meals were relatively expensive.The lobby converts to an area where you can have meals and snacks. However, if you are a non-smoker, I would not suggest that you do this as if people smoke in the area, and there were many people smoking while we were there, it absolutely stinks of tobacco smoke and the air does not clear very quickly. Even walking through can be a bit disgusting.It is worth noting that there is a building site next door but we were never disturbed by the noise. They did not seem to start that early or work that late. Even on one morning when we had a late start, there was clearly activity next door but it was not that noisy.As I checked out, I noticed that this hotel had won some awards in 1996 and 1997. I think that about sums it up. It is clearly past its prime, but is actually quite a reasonable option if you want to stay in that area. I would stay there again, but really only because I am a member of the Starwood program. The Sheraton Park Tower (which is also in the area) is a much nicer hotel but is much more expensive."
81,1151,"Feb 14 2006	Lots of Space and Wonderful Service	I stayed here on my first trip to England and my room was huge by any standard. I was unaware of the no-tipping policy in England and the hotel's bell staff was thrilled to have me there. Room service was always quick and better than average food. My room had a lovely view and a comfy window seat in which to enjoy it. My one and only complaint with this hotel is the phone and internet charges... They were insanely high, but I credit the staff with warning me and even recommending a nearby shop in which to get a phone card.I plan to stay here again and highly recommend it."
82,1151,Feb 13 2006	Overpriced and old	Stayed here for a 2 night break in London in July 2005. The lobby is a low ceilinged affair that makes you feel quite claustrophobic. The lifts are small and unimpressive. Worse is encountered when you reach the rooms. They smell of damp and the bathrooms are desperately in need of refurbishment. The only saving grace was the breakfast which consisted of a good variety of fruit and was well presented.Staff is friendly and helpful but I think you could do a lot better in terms of luxury hotels in London. From the outside this looks like a tired piece of 70's architecture. About time they refurbished!
83,1151,"Feb 9 2006 	Very Nice Very Comfortable Hotel In a Great Location	I travel to London on business every other month and have for 6 years now. I have stayed everywhere imaginable, from Hazlitts to The Berkeley to The Sanderson, and I've pretty much seen it all. I'm used to staying at a more thoughtfully designed hotel than a Sheraton but on my last trip had no other choice as my usuals were booked. Let me say - I was very pleased with every aspect of this hotel! The staff were pleasant and seem to truly enjoy their work. The hotel was clean, the rooms average in size. The decor is admittedly staid and slightly proper, but if you can ignore it this place is a find. The location allows you to run up to Harrods and Harvey Nichols or over to Kings Road easily. Marks &amp; Spencer have a food market just up the road and it's an easy stop on your way home after work. Great wine store across the street too.Highly recommend!"
84,1151,"Nov 15 2005	Much nicer than your typical Sheration	This charming hotel has nicely furnished rooms -- mine was comfortably large -- and superb staff and service. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. Within a 3 minute walk are an excellent supermarket, a Starbucks, bakery, etc. The hotel is situated between two Underground stops, each a 10 walk: Knightsbridge (next to Harrods, Harvey Nichols, etc.) and Sloane Square (many more stores, cafes, etc.). Like most London hotels, internet access (either with your laptop or in the business center) and telephone calls are outrageously priced--get a UK cell phone and go an internet cafe instead."
85,1151,"Oct 23 2005	A smelly old and dank place.	On first entering this hotel the smell of old dead people comes to mind. Considering the price tag this is by far the worst hotel I have ever been in and I include the really bad ones in the USA.The none smoking rooms come fitted with ashtrays, go figure.The staff were great but seriously embrassed when I raised these issues.A tip for the hotel, somewhere, any where they might want to put a clock in the hotel because people who like to travel also like to know what time it is.R"
86,1151,"Oct 22 2005	Very good but needs improvement	The Belgravia is a fine hotel with larger than average rooms for London. The location is only fair, being that is a bit of a trek to a tube stop or the center of London. There are few convienences nearby, but not enough to make it easy to get a good cup of coffee in the morning.Checkin was terribly slow and the hotel seems to be understaffed. I tend to stay in Starwood hotels because of status and benefits of status. There didn't seem to be any benefit of status in this hotel, which is unusual from past experiences in London. I may stay here again if the Park Tower was unavailable, but that would be the only reason"
87,1151,"Sep 16 2005	Great location beautiful interior	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel this past week. It was our last night in London and we wanted somewhere a bit different. The hotel is located in Belgravia which is a 5 minute walk to Knightsbridge. The neighborhood is filled with embassies and beautiful old Georgian style homes. It is absolutely gorgeous. The hotel itself is about a 15 minute walk from the Knightsbridge Underground stop and there are plenty of taxis in the area. This hotel is more of a boutique type. Very quaint with beautiful interiors and an extremely helpful and friendly staff. The room was small but that doesn't bother me. It was clean as was the bathroom and decorated very nicely. Our only complaint but an important one is the bed we slept in had a mattress that was very old. It sloped in towards the middle so we spent a very uncomfortable night tossing and turning and woke with aching backs. I was very surprised at the quality of the mattress as the Sheratons in the US have the heavenly beds and are quite comfortable. In spite of the uncomfortable bed, I would stay here again just because of the location, the quiet neighborhood and the services offered by the hotel."
88,1151,"Aug 19 2005 	A Great Choice	I've now stayed at this hotel twice and I can easily recommend it. In fact, I think this is going to be the only hotel I use in London. The rooms are up the usually high Sheraton standard. The staff are among the best and most service oriented I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. The location is superb: easy walking distance to Buckingham palace and the parks, 15 minute walk to Victoria Station, a 5 minute walk to either of two tube stations (Sloane Sq or Kightsbridge). Highly recommended."
89,1151,"Aug 5 2005 	One of London's Best Kept Secrets	I had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at the Sheraton Belgravia. Their location in Belgravia was on a quiet, leafy, safe, upscale neighbourhood (very convenient to Harrods and Harvey Nichols). The building next door is under construction but this should not be an issue unless you plan on spending 24/7 locked inside your room!The exterior of the building is modern, however once you step inside you will appreciate the charming English atmosphere. The room was well appointed, clean and spacious (for London) with a comforable bed, a sitting area and a full size desk.The staff were very helpful and friendly. Mulberry (the hotel restaurant) was nice, prompt service and good food but slightly pricey (as to be expected in London). There is also a French Bakery, Starbucks and a local market within a block of the hotel.I have stayed at the Marriott County Hall, Sheraton Park Lane, Hilton Park Lane and the Marriott Marble Arch previously but by far, the Sheraton Belgravia has been superior. I will definitely be back again!"
90,1151,"Jul 29 2005	Great service perfect room	I loved staying at the Belgravia! After staying in several hotels in London here's what really stands out:1. Service - the staff were all incredibly helpful, but not pushy, and seemed genuincely surprised when we tipped. They were cheerful and very informative about the city, and took the time to give directions and make reccomedations.2. Rooms - we had 2 large and 2 small suitcases, and this was the only hotel that we didn't have to try to become contortionists to move around the bed and piles of luggage, there was a lot of room. The AC was great, and very much needed, as it was extremely hot and humid during our stay. The bathroom had loads of counter space, and the tub (although narrow) was nice and deep.3. Location - under a 10 minute walk to Harrods, Harvey Nichols, etc, and perhaps a 7 minute walk from the Sloanes Square tube station..we had not trouble getting around.Overall I really enjoyed the Sheraton Belgravia and would reccomend it without hesitation to others"
91,1151,"Jul 3 2005	You will enjoy the quaintness and charm	I am a big fan of Starwood and was not disappointed with the Sheraton in Belgravia. It's a smaller and very quaint Sheraton with nice charm and full amenities that you expect. We had a nice large corner room overlooking an active intersection. It was quiet but, you did hear a little of the hustle and bustle of London that you expect. Belgravia is an upper scale neighborhood surrounded by parks, small shops and of course, a Starbucks. It is located 4-5 walking blocks from Harrods on one end and Hyde Park on the other. It's about a 20 minute walk to Buckingham Palace and many other great locations. London is expensive so at the Mulberry restaurant in the Sheraton an american breakfast of eggs, pancakes, fruit, sausage, bacon and mushrooms is L19 or $34 U.S. dollars. Drones, an excellent French restaurant is just around the corner and worth going to.Overall, very good value, close enough to everything, located in a more residential upscale neighborhoood that feels like home."
92,1151,"Jun 7 2005	Loved the Belgravia --- Sheraton Brand with English Charm	I loved this hotel. The location was great! Not in the middle of everything, but close enough to get where you need to go. It's very close to Sloane Street and Harrod's, and there are cute boutiques right on the same street as the hotel. There is also a really cute gourmet grocery store nearby (not as shockingly expensive as you'd think).I guess you can't leave a proper review about the Belgravia without providing a construction update: in my estimation it's almost over. in fact we didn't hear any construction at all. i was worried about it before staying here but i'm glad it didn't deter me. plus, chances are you will be out of the room if there is any construction happening. and just to clarify, the construction is next door to the hotel, not within the hotel.The hotel is small and very quaint. There is jazz in the lobby around happy hour time, and the staff is very nice and helpful. the concierge Greggers is fantastic with directions and general information.The rooms were nicely appointed and a very nice size. We had a room with a king size bed that they can pull apart as twin beds at night. they have a converter for the plugs that also converts the electricity, and that came in handy, as well. The bathroom size was fine, the shower pressure was good, water was HOT and the tub was deep for a nice soak should you choose. The room also has an in-room safe, which is always good to have while traveling.I would definitely stay here again - it had a perfect combination of the reputation of the Sheraton brand with all of the charm of a London boutique hotel."

1,1160,Great location	Just returned from 2nights stay at this hotel. About 10minute walk from London Bridge and Southwark Underground stations. We visited the O2 arena and a London theatre during our stay and found it a great central location which was very easy to get to.We arrived early on the day of check in and had hoped to leave our bags so that we could go on to our destination but check-in staff were really helpful and found a room available for us to check into immediately (at 10.30am). The room itself was great. Not the biggest but the bed was comfortable with fabulous black out blinds. Road outside was fairly busy so would suggest bringing along ear plugs unless you're used to city traffic. Continental breakfast was great with plenty of variety-we didn't find it necessary to upgrade to the full english but this is an option if you want. Also had an evening meal at the hotel-great value food and drink especially for London. Plenty of main courses for under 10 and very nice too. Other reviews have said that there isn't much nearby but Bourough market has plenty of lunch options while there is a high street about a 5minute walk away with plenty of different restaurant options. Staff were very friendly and helpful during stay. Would definitely stay there again and would recomend it especially for anyone arriving into London via Waterloo or Kings Cross national rail stations due to convenience. Kepp an eye out on their website as they are running offers for weekend stays!
2,1160,"Nov 14 2009 	Lovely	We stayed here for three nights for a special birthday.Fantastic Hotel.Clean, modern freindly staff and very centrally located.The breakfast is a bit expensive if it is not included but there are plenty of little cafes in the area."
3,1160,"Oct 3 2009 	Nice hotel in good location but not the best around if you can get a deal	I stayed here one night when the Novotel next door was too pricey - it was a nice enough hotel, but it was hard not to compare it to the Novotel which was pretty fab - the room at the Southwark Rose was smaller, although nice enough, but there was only one powerpoint in the whole room?? Room service means you have to go and pick your meal up from the restaurant on the 6th floor... Also, my booking sheet said I didn't have breakfast included, but the hotel's reservation said I did, so I didn't eat it and was charged anyway... Otherwise, it's a fine hotel, was nice and clean, staff were friendly, and it's in a good location for exploring London."
4,1160,"Sep 27 2009 	Good Business Hotel Good Value for Location	I have stayed here many times over the last 12 months on business. My company has an office just over London Bridge, near the Monument. The hotel is very modern and clean and has a reasonable restaurant on top. Location is good for access to the City &amp; Tube and price is reasonable considering the location...as a tourist though location would be poor IMHO. The rooms are on the small side but well designed and air conditioned, which is vital for the Summer. There is free use of a safe in the room. The bathrooms have no bath, just a shower so no long soaks after a hard day!! I have always found the staff very polite and helpful. As others have said, the beds are firm and so are the pillows..neither of which trouble me. I recommend solo travelers go for the double bed option as the single beds are small. I have never had a problem with noise at the hotel, so no disturbed nights due to other peoples TVs etc. The hotel seems to be in a mobile phone blackspot for Vodafone and I get a very poor signal and my laptop 3G card simply does not work unless I go to the bar area adjacent to the restaurant. the hotle offers a paid wireless service which i have found worked very reliably."
5,1160,"Sep 23 2009 	The Southwark Rose...	4 of us stayed here back in Feb 2008 just for 1 night. The hotel was very modern, really clean and in a brilliant location for all typical sight-seeing things like london eye, st pauls cathedral and so on. The bar (which im sure was situated at the top of the hotel) was really quiet when we went in at 8pm (ish) and later returned at 1am (ish) and still just as quiet. We didnt have breakfast at the hotel, as it was quite expensive and i find breakfasts at hotels are always the same crap. Be warned the car park is at the bank of the hotel, we didnt know this before hand, parked up a side street to go and check-in and find out where the car park was, only to return to 2 traffic wardens putting a clamp on our car, we were literally 5 mins max! All in all i would recomend this hotel for style, location and value, just find out how to get to the car park BEFORE you arrive."
6,1160,"Sep 18 2009 	Well located and well priced but rock hard beds means no return for us	We stayed for two nights on our way back to Australia. The Hotel is well located two minutes walk from London Bridge tube station and worked well as our launch pad. The hotel is modern and clean, however, we would not go back simply due to how rock hard and uncomfortable the bed was and the pillows were lumpy. If you are looking for a good nights sleep, unless your a very large person or commonly sleep on a bed of nails at home, you will not find it here :( Almost a perfect gem in London if not for this fatal flaw, but easily remedied. The couple who checked out before us also complained about their bed so we suspect it was not an isolated case."
7,1160,"Aug 17 2009 	Modern Clean Comfortable and more	We wanted a hotel in a quiet location close to the South Bank with attached parking. This hotel fitted the needs on paper and more than came up to the mark!The staff were most welcoming, polite and efficient. The room was spacious and clean in a modern design and well equipped. Security was good as access to the corridors could only be gained by the room's swipe card.The car park, not directly controlled by the hotel, was accessed via the back door of the foyer.The continental breakfast, self service style, was extremely plentiful and varied. The hotel's location is about 20 minutes walk from the London Eye along the South Bank which to us was an advantage rather than a disadvantage.Would thoroughly recommend this hotel if its character remains the same."
8,1160,Aug 17 2009 	Ideal London Hotel	Stayed 2 nights here for a wedding in London and I would not fault the hotel or its staff on anything. The rooms were clean and modern with a little traffic noise but nothing that kept us awake. Breakfast is plentiful and set in a great room on the top floor of the hotel. Overall a good value hotel compared with some London hotels.
9,1160,"Aug 13 2009 	Could not fault this hotel in any way	Firstly may I just say ,I booked the advance weekend package and I don't think I could have got better value for money in London.Very clean,spacious enough, very friendly hotel staff and location was just amazing, 2mins walk to the banks of the River Thames.Well within walking distance to major attractions.We did have a meal in the hotel and found this to be very resonable to.I would not hesitate in booking this hotel again and i would recommend to all my friends, having stayed in London a few times this year and this by far was the best hotel and I think it far better than the 3 star it quoted."
10,1160,"Aug 10 2009 	fantastic Weekend break	We have just had a family weekend in London. The main purpose of our break was to see Romeo and Juliet at The Globe Theatre. This was a fantastic production. We chose the Southwark Rose Hotel because of location. It was perfect. There were many attractions within easy walking distance. The hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly. Our rooms,although rather small,had all amenities we could want including a safe. They were really clean. We enjoyed pre dinner drinks in the bar and were able to walk to local restaurants for our evening meal. I would recommend Tas Pide restaurant opposite The Globe Theatre entrance. Continental breakfast in the hotel was very substantial with good choice. None of us felt the need for a full engish breakfast. 3 members of the party were vegetarian and they could have had a vegetarian cooked breakfast. One tip; London Bridge is the nearest tube station. Take the Borough High Street west side exit to Southwark Street. It makes finding the hotel much easier. We took another exit and also a long time to find the hotel. We all want to return to this hotel"
11,1160,Jul 27 2009 	Well Placed confortable and clean.	We stayed a week-end. The hotel is conveniently paced very close to Thames south bank and is comfortable and clean. Is quiet with a good shower. It has a bar/restaurant open till 2.00 am.
12,1160,Jul 16 2009 	WELL LOCATED EFFICIENT HOTEL	We stayed in this hotel for 9 nights and found it really well-located for all kinds of activities.The continental breakfast was excellent . The rooms although quite small were clean and comfortable. The area is quite quiet and we slept very well. The week-end special offer made it a good quality for the price we paid. The only negative thing we found was that instructions and important notices were only written in English- at least one other language would have been desirable.
13,1160,"Jul 13 2009 	A boutique hotel	Good location, it is a fine stay for a boutique hotel, room of a fair size, food was fine and so was the service."
14,1160,Jul 4 2009 	What a rip off!	Where to begin! Room - pokey ...bathroom - good job I don't have a cat! I would never be able to swing it in that bathroom. Not to mention the fact that they DON'T PROVIDE HAND TOWELS!!! Beds - I have slept on softer floors. Reception staff - surley and indifferent and couldn't even get the booking right when we were stood in front of them!! Parking - my favourite - advertised as 20 per day online but if you take your car out of the car park after arrival and before departure you pay by the hour! Our 20 ended up costing us 28!!! Had to ask where the car park was as no visible information as how to find it. Would I recommend this hotel? Not a cat in hell's chance!!!!
15,1160,"May 27 2009 	Believe the hype	Stayed at Southwark Rose hotel over the Bank holiday weekend with my girlfriend. Nice hotel, good location, on the bustling South Bank, near London Bridge station, Borough Market, etc. Even walking to Covent Garden and the touristy centre doesn't take long (especially when the sun is shining). If you can book a couple of months in advance, you should be able to get a good deal, paying less than the rates displayed in the lobby. A very good deal even, if you keep the quality and location in mind. The rooms are clean, big enough and the staff are friendly. Didn't have any meals in the hotel, so cannot comment on that. But overall, recommended."
16,1160,"Apr 24 2009 	decent hotel terrible food	Spent for GBP 160 night in Southwark Rose. The loction is excellent, rooms are very small but OK but I shouldn't have finished my hamburger when I thought the taste was a bit off....draught beers were warm. Not going back here...in this area Hilton London Bridge is much better."
17,1160,"Apr 15 2009 	Good value hotel well located bad breakfast!	We paid 110 per night for a double room and this offered very good value for money. Had we paid their standard rate we might have felt a little less happy, but at this price (and on a Saturday night in London) we couldn't really complain.The location is good - just a 5 min walk to the Tate Modern. You can cross the embankment at your leisure and within 15 mins you could be walking on Fleet Street. It also benefits from having London Bridge tube station a mere 4 minute walk away. DO NOT order a taxi via the hotel. We paid an extortionate 12 for a 2 minute ride to the rather soul-less Hays Galeria development. The hotel is very modern in style and the rooms are lovely. I was anticipating that they would be tiny, but they were more than adequate. We failed to get a non-smoking room (despite having requested one) and the odour of cigarette smoke was quite unpleasant at times, which is worth considering. The breakfast is reasonable value, particularly if you opt for the veggie version. For 11 you also have access to all the continental offerings. However, I couldn't recommend it. It can't be that difficult to cook a few hash browns, veggie sausages and mushrooms, but it was quite a poor quality affair. Unless it's absolutely essential to have breakfast at the hotel I would suggest avoiding it. However, at the price we paid, this hotel did offer very reasonable value for money."
18,1160,"Apr 5 2009 	fantastic	The room, and hotel were very clean and all the staff were very very friendly. Having never been to London before was a little unsure where to book a hotel but very glad this is the one we decided on. The bed was comfortable and the room cosy. The restaurant staff were friendly and the food was reasonably priced and very nice. Would stay again and have recommended it to several friends."
19,1160,"Feb 23 2009 	Wonderful Staff	We booked this hotel late at a cost of 65 per night for a double room which was excellent value.We arrived at the hotel and found the car park which is at the rear of the hotel. We got to the bar just after 10pm and not realising the time asked if they were still serving food. Although the restaurant had closed we were advised that as the kitchen staff were still there they would make us something and gace us the choice of the full menu. The food was excellent value and there is a decent vegi selection.The bar is open until 2am and also provides very reasonably priced bar snacks - chips 1.90, sandwich 3.50 from 10pm - 2am. The drinks are also not too expensive and there is free internet access.The location of the hotel is fantastic. Very close to Southwark Bridge and easy walking dstance to many attractions.The room was big enough for a couple of nights although I did find the bed a little hard and the toilet roll holder was falling off the wall.A hairdryer and iron are provided and there is a mirror built into the dressing table, which I managed to miss until we left as I kept putting my coat on the flap that you lift up!There is access to a local fitness suite / sauna free of charge although I didn't try this out.The continental breakfast was ok for 8.95 and they do a vegi cooked breakfast, which I didn't try. My husband was not at all impressed with the Full English Breakfast though.Parking is 20 per day and is also the car park for hotels a good 5 min walk away. London Bridge Tube Station is only a few minutes walk.Overall, I would definitely stay here again. It may not be the most luxurious hotel but it''s excellent value and the staff do everything (and more) to make your stay enjoyable."
20,1160,"Feb 3 2009 	Good hotel	The hotel is located near the subway, so no problem to get downtown. Rooms are not very big but with a very nice interior, quiet and clean. The breakfast buffet is very nice, too."
21,1160,"Feb 1 2009 	Never again!	Reading the other reviews on this site I wonder if we are even talking about the same hotel. I have never been prompted to write a negative review before - I always prefer to give the benefit of the doubt, but my experience of this place was awful . The staff were unwelcoming, unhelpful and charmless. The room was smelly (smoke, even though it was apparently a non-smoking room) and claustrophobic (not much room for more than 1 person and a suitcase), the bed uncomfortable (much too hard), the television reception very poor, the shower COLD (!!) and the breakfast very disappointing and overpriced. It was also very noisy during night. Only good thing to say was that room was clean - although this should be standard. I normally stay in one of the nearby chain hotels, but thought the Southwark Rose looked modern and interesting and decided to give it a try, depsite it being more expensive. My advice, stay at the Travel Inn down the road, it might not have such a trendy website but you will have a good nights' sleep and not leave feeling utterly ripped off. The only thing I can recommend about the Southwark Rose is the surrounding area, i.e. once you step outside the front door the experience improves dramatically. Sorry, don't have a positive note to end on - one to avoid!!!"
22,1160,"Jan 3 2009	Convenient Location	Just spent an overnight stay at this hotel following seeing a West End Show.It was very convenient for London Bridge Station and within easy walking distance of Thames attractions - Tate Modern, Globe, Millenium Bridge with easy access to St Pauls and other City sites. The hotel was smart, modern and quiet. Bedroom was quite large for a City Hotel, well equipped, with safe and hairdryer, dressing table/desk, 2 phones and plenty of wardrobe space. En suite shower, washbasin and toilet was also a good size. Continental breakfast had a large choice and there were good views from the 6th floor dining room. Staff friendly and helpful.Altogether a good place to stay in London."
23,1160,"Dec 9 2008 	mostly good value	The hotel is mostly a good value, with everything being well up to scratch, except the beds. The bed was very firm to the point of unacceptable. The highlight, however, was the service and the staff - everyone, including front desk, restaurant and cleaning ladies were extremely helpful. They provided extra duvets to make beds softer. Free internet. Overall, good."
24,1160,"Dec 2 2008 	A Rose with no thorns!	Spent 3 nights at the Southwark Rose at a special weekend rate of 85 pounds per room per night - fantastic value! The hotel is modern and comfortable with everything you need - they even had a corkscrew in the room. The bar/restaurant area provides free internet and unlimited free tea and coffee. There is a late night bar menu from 11 pm to 2 am which provides sandwiches and chips at reasonable prices great for the late night munchies!The hotel is situated just off Southwark bridge, and the South Bank. The nearest tube station is London Bridge (5 min walk) on the Jubilee line. Borough Market (Food) is also less than 5 minutes away and is an absolute must! If you fancy breakfast with a difference check out the organic porridge with stewed apples and fruit at the market on Thursday, Friday and Saturday mornings. Rick Stein recommended Cornish Pasties also went down a treat for lunch from Mr. Mowbrays stall - food heaven! For those on a tight budget ( or just fancy a great cooked breakfast in a local cafe with no fuss or fancy decor) Cafe Rossi located opposite the entrance to Borough market is a gem. Get the day off to a great start for less than a fiver!"
25,1160,"Nov 25 2008 	Book It Now	This is truly an exceptional hotel. From the moment we entered till our departure we felt pampered, well taken care of and extremely welcome. The staff at all levels are friendly, knowledgeable and anxious to help.The hotel is very well situated; many attractions are within walking distance.....Tate Modern, Globe Theatre ,Southbank Centre.Soutwark Cathedral,Borough market,the original Clink site museum and Tower of London. All other attractions are easily accessible by tube. Nearest station,London Bridge is a 5 minute walk and Cannon street is about 8 minutes away. The latter is handy if you're arriving in London at Victoria station,as no change is required.The decor of the hotel is sharp, clean minimalist....very relaxing. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable. Beds are firm, rooms(to the rear) are very quiet. Rooms have a good bathroom/toilet. great power shower and good quality cosmetics. Rooms have wide screen HD tv with internet, electronic safe with internal power point enabling safe recharging of your mobile and laptop, tea&amp; coffee making facilities with top quality products(great cookies!!!) and two comfortable swivel chairs plus all the other amenities you'd expect in a top class hotel.Breakfast is a wonderful treat. We took the continental option.Large variety of top notch products....meats, cheeses, cereals ,juices fresh fruit salad,dried fruits and best of all hot porridge. Earthenware teapots are supplied along with good English tea....so no nasty teabags dangling out of cups!!! A wide variety of newspapers is available for your perusal. Small details like this make for an outstanding hotel.This was one of the most pleasant stays I've ever had in a city hotel anywhere.The staff ensured this wonderful experience....housekeeping staff do an amazing job each day.Finally, I would like to congratulate the manager( whom I didn't get the opportunity to meet) on running a top class hotel at very affordable prices. I will return to this hotel and have no hesitation whatsover in recommending it to others."
26,1160,"Oct 30 2008 	Good value with the right deal	Less than 10 minutes from London Bridge station, fairly close to Tate Modern.Double room size typical for London, so compact. Clean, generally well equipped and modern. Very pleasant staff. Restaurant a bit limited for choice but quite good for what it was. I stayed two nights for total room cost 190 so good value if you get a deal.One real irritant - there's only one electricity socket in the room and the hotel doesn't have any extension leads so if you want to charge up your laptop and use a second electrical item, you're out of luck."
27,1160,"Oct 4 2008	Looking for the thorn	Had stayed previously next door at the Novotel and driven mad by its split bathrooms, wanted to try something else.Room was bigger and somewhat more spacious than that at the Novotel (and not just, I think, because I ended up in a handicap room), though fittings and furnishings less plush.Still, the room has most of the basics covered, only thing really missed vis a vis the Novotel was the lack of a in-room fridge at the Rose.... Place is also run somewhat more informally than the Novotel, which is a mixed blessing of charm and carelessness; a late-night call from a friend to my room was twice mis connected, waking up some poor old lady down the hall.... Not sure if true at Novotel, but kitchen of the hotel closes at 10:30pm which can be inconvenient at times. (Also no free newspapers or magazines like in the Novotel lobby.)A benefit of the Rose is the free Internet access in the top-floor restaurant outside business hours and certain other times. Plus it's cheaper, though bill must be examined closely as I was initially billed for much higher than the confirmed rate for a couple nights till I showed my confirmation.All in all, a good deal."
28,1160,"Oct 3 2008 	Hotel Parking	we stayed at hotel for a weekend break, also to go to the criterion theatre to see 39 steps which was very good. we had to get a bus to the theatre from the hotel, bus stop was by st pauls which was over the bridge from the hotel. once on the bus its about 10-15mins from st pauls. that not to bad. we could have got a tube but you have to change and get on another train.the hotel is very nice, the room was on the small size and me and my husband were bumping into each other. felt abit like sardines in a tin. however the room was clean and looks nice.we had 2 bath towels. it could have done with an hand towel awell.when i booked the hotel it states it is 16 to park your car for 24 hours on my booking form. it also states in the hotel pack in the room. it is 16 a day. we was charged 40. for 2 days. we were told it has gone up. they did not seem brothed about this and tey did not offer a refund. i have wrote to the hotel manager for a refund, we went up to the bar on the 5th floor to have a drink at 10.30pm the bar person was doing something and he did not seem interested in us. so we left after about 10mins. and went to the hotel next door for a drink."
29,1160,"Sep 23 2008 	business stay	This hotel seems a very nice hotel but do not stay on the 5th floor. It is noisy. There seems to be regular noise from the 6th floor/roof, not sure if its the plantroom up there or something else but there was bangs and clanks during the night. It may need further accoustic protection! I'm not the first to report this problem on review websites.Also in the morning of my nights stay the kitchen power was down and so it was continental breakfast only for about 9!!"
30,1160,"Aug 13 2008 	Loved this hotel	I primarily picked this place on our European honeymoon because we had tickets to see King Lear at the Globe (it's own amazing experience). I am glad I chose where we did.The hotel is located very close to the Thames River and the heart of London. It is a bit of a walk to get to places across the river like St Paul's, but nearby is the London Bridge underground station. It is about a 10 minute walk away, but we were worried about walking from there to the hotel at night, although we had no incidents.The hotel staff was good and I had no complaints about them. Our room was on the second floor and had no view, but that was not a major problem. The room was a decent size with modern amenities. The bed was comfortable and we slept very well. Our bathroom was a bit small, but comfortable. My major complaint about the bathroom was that we only had two towels, including no floor towel, and the shower is a swinging door that leaked onto the floor.As someone who enjoys a good television, the television was very cool. I would highly recommend this hotel, and it is a good value for the cost."
31,1160,"Aug 6 2008 	nice hotel!	this hotel is the perfect location!! The hotel is very modern the rooms were on the small side but spotlessly clean which in my view is more important than a huge room.the bar/restaurant on the 6th floor is nice, had couple drinks and chat with helpful and friendly barman,impressed! The breakfast was included in the rates and was a full English. It was very nice.and the staff were kind enough.If you visit on Thursday - Saturday don't miss Borough Market. The atmosphere is wonderful and there is so much high quality food . The pubs and restaurants around the market provide a great place to sit and watch the world go by.Would definitely stay here again."
32,1160,"Aug 3 2008 	Great hotel	Stayed here for one night as a treat after seeing a midnight showing of King Lear at the Globe Theatre, which is only a five-minute walk away. Check-in was a breeze and the room was fine; bright, clean and certainly bigger than the room we stayed in in New York at Easter that cost twice the price! Although quite large, the Southwark Rose has a boutique-y feel to it and, despite being a little off the beaten track, it's in a great location for the South Bank's offerings (the Tate Modern, Globe, City Hall, Hay's Galleria, the attractions around London Bridge - Tower Bridge is another 10 minutes or so along the river - and so on). It was good to have a safe in the room, plus an iron &amp; ironing board as standard. The large flat screen TV was a nice touch, although it responded a bit erratically to the remote! Had a drink in the 6th floor bar but didn't eat there; the menu seemed OK but it wasn't at all busy on a Friday night and didn't have the greatest of atmospheres - maybe this is more of a business hotel but at these prices it's a steal for clued-up tourists too. Only a couple of (minor) negatives: the hotel's website offers a choice of upper or lower floors - we chose upper and yet ended up with a room on the second of six floors; we also asked for a late check-out on the web booking and mentioned this again on checking in. We were advised to call reception on the morning of the check-out to confirm, which we duly did, and yet still the maid was knocking on the door a few minutes after the standard check-out time."
33,1160,"Jun 14 2008 	Really Good	Nice modern hotel with a good bar. Some language barriers with the barman who, when asked if he had any nuts or Japenese rice crackers, presented us with a plate full of dry Jacobs Cream Crackers. Funny though! Very clean, comfortable hotel with contemporary design, flat screen tv and good inroom facilities. Only complaint was there only seemed to be a thin window covering which let the light in early morning. Didn't stay for breakfast so no comments there. Not brilliant for the tube if you have lots of luggage but managed to get a cab no problem outside. All in all, nice hotel which would probably be double the price if it wasn't on the southbank."
34,1160,"Jun 11 2008 	Good hotel	Very nice hotel with good price value if you book a long weekend for 85 a night. I have staid in London three times before and the hotels were all awfull. So I know what to expect in a hotel in London and Southwark Rose was compared to those really good! Only remark I have to make is about the bed, it was really too hard. Furthermore the room is very modern and well equiped. I would definitely stay here again. (we did not have breakfast here, instead we went to Starbucks which is only a 3 min. walk away from the hotel)."
35,1160,"Jun 7 2008 	Nice room awful breakfast!	Really nice room, great it was air conditioned. Make sure you if you request a non smoking room when you book you also double check when you arrive. Breakfast was AWFUL! 12.95 for a full and continental...breakfast on my BA flight was more impressive. Bad tasting and just overpriced. Staff at front desk are not super friendly."
36,1160,"Jun 3 2008 	Clean and functional but awful towels	We booked a room at the Southwark Rose as business commitments meant a late night followed by an early start. We chose the Southwark Rose for its location and its price plus it has some onsite parking available.Check In was good and the room was small but comfortable. You need your key card to access the lift which suggests to me that they may have had some issues in the past. The bathroom only had a shower but that was fine. Importantly it had a decent water pressure! The only real issue was the towels. As with many of the cheaper hotels they were small, thin and bordering on threadbare. We requested replacements but they were no better. We did not eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food.Overall it was OK as an overnight stopover. I would not recomment it for longer stays."
37,1160,"May 20 2008 	Nice And Modern	This is a nice modern hotel on the South bank of the Thames, with stylish decor.Enjoyed the stay of two nights.Only complaints are: The room could have been cleaned a little better, gave the appearance of being rushed.At breakfast the dishes and plates were not taken away when used, so the table filled up with empties. Also the English breakfast was not value for money."
38,1160,"May 18 2008 	Non smokers beware!	We made a booking for this hotel in March, several weeks before our stay, and at that pointed stated a non smoking preference. When we arrived at the hotel, we showed our booking confirmation and were allocated a room. When we got into the room, there was a distinct smell of stale smoke. We opened all the windows and went out for a while, but on our return the smell was still there. Our friends who had booked at the same time (and had arrived after us) were on a different floor and had a non smoking room. They came back to our room and indeed there was a smell of stale smoke as soon as one stepped out of the lift on that floor! We then went to reception and asked for a non smoking room as stated on our booking confirmation, but the manageress was less than helpful. She said at the time of booking, we only stated a preference, and they allocated rooms as people arrived. So stating a preference on a booking form is a complete waste of time, as hotels (at least this one!) take no notice of that preference and will just give you whatever is available. When we checked in, we weren't asked if we wanted a smoking or a non smoking room. So if you definitely want a non smoking room, and book through a website and not directly with the hotel, make sure you contact the hotel and confirm that you want a non smoking room. We were able to move rooms for the second night, but were annoyed at the attitude of the manageress. She could at least have apologised. The rest of the staff we found courteous and helpful."
39,1160,"May 9 2008 	Mediocre Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights because it was conveniently located just across Southwark Bridge where my office is. However, I didn't think much of it because the rooms were too small and seemed quite old as well. I had one big Samsonite luggage with me and another carry-on and there wasn't even a place to put the bags. The bathroom lacked space as well and there was no place for my toiletries. There wasn't a proper closet, more a cheap one where the door was rolling back and forth. Anyway, there are a couple of hotels in the vicinity which are much better."
40,1160,"May 1 2008 	As always Excellent experience in the Southwark	This was the second time for us to stay at the Southwark. Our first visit was somewhat tarnished by a booking error, and our subsequent hanging around reception for some time whilst it was sorted out.It appears they have overcome this problem, as check-in was swift and hassle-freeThe rooms, as we remembered them, were very tidy and clean, and of a good size for a city hotel. Shower facilities were good (no bath-tub, and they are a bit stingy on the soap unless you ask for a bit more).Otherwise the room has all the amenities - hair-dryer, safe with internal socket (so you can lock away and recharge your laptop), internet-ready TV (internet is paid for, but is free at the restaurant), tea and coffee facilities (where would you be in England if you couldn't make a cuppa?).The rest of the hotel is stylishly decorated, with works of up and coming photographers lining the walls. The top floor carries the hotel's restaurant, where in the morning a fell well stocked and spread continental breakfast is served - if you had a late night the night before, pay a little extra and get yourself a full English breakfast - they do it to an art!Internet if freely available in the restaurant, and there is a big screen TV for those wishing to catch up on the news at breaky.The best part about this hotel is it's location. Its a crawl away from atleast FOUR (yes, count them) pubs, 3 minutes walk from London Bridge tube (giving you access to the Jubilee and Northern lines), and 2 minutes walk to the river. It really is central london, and whether your there for business or pleasure, you could not really find a better place.And to top things off, the usual rates are very reasonable. We got our room for EUR 100 a night, which by London standards should be the usual rate for a two star, unless you book under some special offer. I highly recommend this hotel if your looking for a clean, nice room in the heart of London, but don't feel like busting your wallet for typical London high prices."
41,1160,"Mar 17 2008 	fab hotel	after looking on various websites booked this via superbreak as we were going to see prince in concert at the o2 and the after show party and wanted somewhere central that we could get home from after the concert in the very early hours. we couldnt have picked a better hotel. couple of minutes walk to london bridge tube, which connects everywhere! grabbed the tube to the o2 for a stunning concert, and at .4.30 in the morning simply got the thames clipper back to london bridge . we were amazed how easy it was.!! everything ran smoothly. a lot of the staff were foreigners but had a good understanding of the english language. ate in the hotel friday night, and really nice food, breakfast at the weekend was plentiful, continental as standard but you can upgrade to full english. we did and it was well worth it. tip - after returning from london bridge tube station cut through the car park at the back of the hotel and use back doors!!overall wonderful weekend, hotel highly recommended"
42,1160,"Mar 12 2008	Rose - reasonable value	A little bit out of the way, but close to Borough Market and the South Bank areas - just close to a slightly edgy area.Clinical but stylish reception and rooms, nice bar and restaurant area. Pretty good value for central London too."
43,1160,"Mar 2 2008 	Had a great stay	We have just arrived back from a stay at the Southwark Rose Hotel.The location was just over the river on the south bank, it is very close to a few good pubs and restaurants on the south bank. It is a 5 minute walk to the Borough Market and just a bit further to the London Bridge tube station so very central.The rooms were clean and well proportioned. My only criticism is that there were only two smallish bath towels but other than that it was fine. We didnt eat at the hotel so cant make a comment on the quality. We did have a drink and found the restaurant/bar area to be very comfortable. There is also free internet access in the bar area.The hotel staff were friendly and efficient. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short stay."
44,1160,"Jan 15 2008	ripped off	nice and tidy hotel. But when it comes to checking out, that's when the hotel earns a bit more out off your pocket. When i put the parking ticket in the machine it said i had to pay 18. i'd only been parked up for 13 hours. They couldn't care less when asked if this was correct."
45,1160,"Dec 15 2007 	Excellent location	Just returned from a short break staying at The Southwark Rose Hotel. The location was excellent being very close to London Bridge underground with easy connections to King's Cross and all the main London sights including The 02.The hotel reception and staff were more than welcoming and we were given a spotless room on the first floor which was very comfortable and seemed to have brand new fittings. The corridors were lit in a stunning fashion and the whole hotel had the appearance of at least 4 stars. We dined in the restaurant as we were tired after our journey and although it was quiet (it was mid week) we enjoyed our meal very much.We booked our hotel through Superbreak and we were very pleased overall as they also made the arrangements for the nearby London Eye and The Terracotta Army exhibition at The British Museum. We booked Spamalot ourselves and this was terrific and we also took the short trip by Tube to The 02 to see the Tutankhamun exhibition.We would recommend staying in this location as there are fine views across the river from here to St Pauls, Parliament etc and you are only yards away from The Millenium Bridge ,The Globe Theatre and The Borough Market.We will certainly use this hotel again as it has been a pleasant change from the bustling places we have stayed at across the river."
46,1160,"Nov 5 2007 	Lovely hotel	We stayed for 2 nights in this hotel and were very impressed by it. People say you should take a star off a hotel's rating In london but not in this case, it's a VERY good 3 star and, in fact, as nice as many a four star we've stayed in. Very clean, nicely decorated rooms (Pretty much exactly as you see on the website), spotless white duvet cover instead of grotty blankets (that always gets my vote!), very nice bathroom (Shower no bath but a very big shower!). We had continental breakfast included which is in a nice setting on the top floor, comfy seats and daily papers to read. The breakfast was fine, good selection of fruit, yoghurt, pastries etc. I wouldn't pay 6.95 for it but when it's included it was very good.We LOVED the location of the hotel, GREAT atmosphere around along the South Bank of the river with new (and old!) bars, restaurants and cafes less than 5 minutes walk away. The Globe Theatre is 3 mins walk away and well worth a visit even if there are no plays on. We walked to Covent Garden in 30 minutes, a really lovely walk along the river at night with all the lights and lively atmosphere. We even walked back to the hotel at the end of the night as we enjoyed the walk so much the first time! Overall, a VERY good hotel for London, we were over for a function and talking to friends staying in other hotels, I think we did very well in terms of quality for the price we paid."
47,1160,"Oct 18 2007 	Good Hotel	Well positioned on surprisingly quiet Southwark Bridge Road 300 Metres from the South Bank Riverside Walk and 400 Metres from London Bridge Underground and Borough Market. Very clean, well run hotel with modern decor. Room was well equiped and the shower was very good. The beds are firm and if you are used to a soft bed you may find them hard. Buffet continental breakfast included fresh fruit, cheese and cold meats and was good. Very good rates through Superbreak. I would stay there again. Martin Lander"
48,1160,"Oct 10 2007 	Worth Your Consideration	Stayed here in a double for six nights in early October 2007. No real complaints, and nothing to get really excited about. Prices varied per night but averaged about 110 pounds.I was in a fifth floor room at the back, away from the street. The room was very quiet, although I did hear a nightly series of loud thumps apparently coming from the restaurant/bar on the sixth floor. Folks along the street side should understand that traffic along Southwark Bridge Road, while very real, is considerably less than traffic in the West End.By American standards, the room was small. By London standards, typical. The decor was unoffensive, but struck me as something out of Office Depot. The bed was firm and comfortable. The pillows, all four of them, were OK but a little hard for my tastes. The only chairs provided were two small thinly padded chairs pushed up under a narrow desk laid out underneath the window. Closet and shelf space in the wardrobe was adequate for me but might challenge a couple. There's really no good out-of-the-way place to store your bags, though.The bathroom was bright and big enough. No tub, but the shower was great: powerful and as hot as i wanted it.The room offered a small TV located on a bracket up in a corner. Several pay movie channels and a small handful of BBC, ITV, Sky, and Channel 4 offerings were available. Fine for a quick check of news and weather before leaving in the morning.The AC/heating seemed pretty feeble to me. The heat eventually took the chill out of the air in the evening, when the outside temps dropped into the 50's. The unit would not be adequate on a real winter's day. The bed had a comforter, but no top sheets or blankets. As noted elsewhere, the window did not open.Staffers were competent and willing to please. The restaurant is a small narrow affair on the sixth floor, and includes a tiny bar. Didn't eat there, but I'd guess you wouldn't need to make a reservation since it didn't seem busy. No room service is offered.The restuarant offered 3 different breakfasts: a continental, an English breakfast, and a veggie version of the English breakfast, priced in the 10 pound range. Oddly, the continental was available only by prior arrangement, but was offered free if you ordered the veggie breakfast.The hotel is located a few minutes walk from the London Bridge Underground and railway station. In between is the Borough Market and several coffee shops, which are a better bet for a light breakfast. The Novotel immediately adjacent has a cafe, which might be worth trying.Pubs and such are sparse in the immediate neighborhood. The best bet for catching a snack or a drink seems to be the Borough Market area.All in all, this hotel seemed like a good deal given current London prices. If transported to the U.S. it would be seen as an economy hotel along the lines of a Comfort Inn. If you are looking for such a place outside the noisy and crowded West End, it's well worth considering. However, if you are looking for something plusher and fancier, understand that you won't find it in London at these prices."
49,1160,"Oct 8 2007 	Fancy! Funky! Fancy!	We found the hotel lobby/restaurant/guest room design very funky &amp; the art work by some Japanese artist were very impressive. The corridor lighting was stunning. However, the air-con did not work as we liked so the room was a bit warm.. Can't open the windows too as it was over-looking the road (which was a bit noisy). No room service at night, but we managed to get some ice in the top floor bar. No minibar too but we did not mind it at all as we were out most of the time anyway but it'll be nice to have the option. Very central.Service was kinda rushed in Front Desk &amp; the Bar although the lady at the desk (think her name is Katie) &amp; the male manager (probably Front Office Manager or Security Manager) were very helpful. Was happy with the hotel all in all."
50,1160,"Aug 20 2007 	Not artsy... just fartsy.	THE REALITY: If you're looking for a soul-less hotel that feels like a medical ward in a semi-convenient location then this is the dream bargain for you! We stayed here for (prepaid) 5 nights and were initially assigned the now infamous handicapped room. We returned to the front desk and they moved us to a smoking room without telling us. Stained yellow drapes.... seriously. Back downstairs... they finally found a &quot;suite&quot; to put us in for the night, telling us we would have to move the following morning. Nice attempt, but.... Ugh. The &quot;suite&quot; (and all of the rooms) were lousy and on par with a roadside motel in New Jersey. Hanging up partially clad shots of an asian artist does not make the place artsy... it's a band-aid on an axe wound. The &quot;included&quot; breakfast was lame and they charged for burnt lattes. No free wireless (what is this 1998?). We spent $100.00 just checking our email. The rate seemed decent, but after a little more research, we found an abundance of classier alternatives. THE GOOD: The staff did try (after being prodded), but were often tied to the grim realities of this lame hotel. London is VERY expensive, but next time we'll do better... MUCH better. STAY AWAY!"
51,1160,"Aug 17 2007 	Great weekend	We recently stayed at the Southwark Rose for 3 nights. Great to be within walking distance of great places such as the Royal Festival Hall where we saw Carmen.The room was fine although traffic noise audible, our only disappointment was the restaurant. The room itself was lovely and our waitress helpful, but the food was diabolical I wouldn't even describe the person in the kitchen as a cook let alone chef! My husband foolishly agreed to have the soup of day CHEESE !!! I knew he was asking for trouble and he was it was inedible.Needless to say we dined there on the first night only. That said I would recommend the hotel to friends as the tube was near by, bus tours and places of interest easily accessible. We had a great weekend."
52,1160,"Jul 22 2007 	You could do a lot better for the money in London	I was allocated a disabled room, with handles everywhere, low switches and emergency buttons and cords. The bathroom, for this reason, was also fitted out for somebody in a wheelchair. My room also featured badly noise-insulated interconnecting doors - great if you need these facilities, not so great if you don't. This would make for a very &quot;functional&quot; room if you are a disabled traveller.Tiny TV 14&quot; up in the top corner of the room. Couple of light stains on the duvet cover. Cheap and nasty toiletries that neglected to include anything you could remotely identify as shampoo. Water pressure in the shower was not great either.Continental breakfast included the cheapest cuts of meat, lots of processed cheese and a coffee served from a machine. London has some terrible hotels - this is certainly NOT one of them. For me, it's a last resort if none on my preferred list of hotels in the area are available."
53,1160,"Jul 12 2007 	Great Hotel near Central London	Staying in London in a couple of hotels traveling for business on my own (110  120 a night excl. breakfast and always noisy) the Southwark Bridge hotel was a relief.I would recommend this hotel and I definitely stay here next time I am in London.The hotel: 80 on a Sunday nightA modern furnished and clean hotel, near the Thames in a safe neighborhood. Even the elevator in the hotel is secured and can just be used by hotel guests with a smart card. Hotel staff: normal.Although the rooms are on the small side they offer you all the comfort youll need; a clean, modern en suite with a good shower, a nice bed with a duvet (no doubtful blankets), an iron board and a safe deposit in your cupboard. Rooms have air conditioning, which can be switched off. The electric blinds which you can operate yourself from within your room are just fancy; I rather would have had real blinds, without the electrics The windows of your room can be opened just a little. Although the main road in front of the hotel is rather quiet; I had asked for a room at the back of the hotel, with seemed to have a nice view on the London tower.The wifi connection to the Internet at the hotel room is restricted and secured by T-Mobile, which I think is disappointing. At the sixth floor, where the bar and restaurant are located, you can find two PCs with a free live Internet connection and a printer; nice to know if you would like to print out your boarding card for the next day? Unfortunately I have found this out the next morning when I enjoyed a continental breakfast (9, Monday morning)Getting thereAlthough someone advised to take the Circle line form Paddington to the Mansion house station, it took me some time to get there.Perhaps taking the Bakerloo line until Charing Cross and then transfer to the Circle line to Mansion House is quicker?Leaving Mansion House station and then turn right and right again is the quickest route I quess. I turned left and left again and walked by the Millenium Bridge to the South bank of the Thames; two hundred meters to the left I was on the Southwark Bridge Road again.From the end of the bridge its a four hundred meters (2 minutes) walk to the hotel and on the left side of the road you will find the hotel. What I have learned from the reviews; dont let the distances mentioned distract you upfront; it often is just a little walk.Tip:If you want to travel to the e.g. The Tate Gallery or Waterloo Station just take a boat trip organized by London Transport.The first pier east of the Southwark Bridge (100 meters) offers you several boat trips from 10AM.I took the Tate to Tate (From Tate Modern to The Tate Gallery near Millbank and it cost me 4; a nice boat trip and a wonderful view of the banks of the Thames and especially the Houses of Parliament.

54,1160,"Jul 4 2007 	Lovely modern hotel	If you are visiting London, this hotel is the perfect location. You can walk to almost every major sight: London Eye, Big Ben, Tate modern... It is all within a 20-25 minute walk.The hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful. Stayed in a suite room... The sitting room had all you need for a night in and with the kitchenette area, you had all you would need when comming with children.The shower was wonderful - very strong water pressure and big shower heads.The rooms are very well insulated... we had a room facing the main street, but could not hear any street noise (the blinds make your late morning very nice and cosy).The breakfast was very good. It was not included in my price, but for only 9.95 per person for full english - it was really worth it!I would stay hear again... The hotel is very clean, rooms good size, staff very friendly and again, modern and new!"
55,1160,Jun 14 2007 	Great little spot	Delighted to have found this great place which for us made the perfect bolthole in London. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was a bit on the small side but well laid out and had everything we needed. Great opportunity to visit the nearby Borough Market with plenty of stuff for foodie fans and there were plenty of cafes etc for eating just over the road and around Southwark Bridge. Two mins walk. St Paul's etc very walkable too. Made a change to be staying in a part of London that wasn't in the heartland of tourist hotels. Will return
56,1160,"Jun 8 2007 	Clean modern comfortable handy to South Bank attractions.	The Southwark Rose Hotel is perfectly functional with modern dcor, clean, comfortable accommodations. Quiet rooms. It is great for art lovers as it is just a 5 minute walk to the Tate Modern, Globe Theatre and other South Bank attractions. We also discovered, to our great delight, the Borough Market, open Fridays and Saturdays and just a short walk from the hotel; all manner of foodstuffs, much of it organic and artisan made products, fresh produce, in short - a great food spectacle. Plenty of pubs around but not many really good restaurants, so it's fine if you like pub food. Note: England is going smoke-free on July 1.On the downside: The breakfast at the hotel was greatly overpriced and the prices seemed to change often. For example, on a Monday a mediocre continental breakfast would have cost us 8 each, in dollars that's $16. Weekends were a little less. Instead, we went to a nearby coffee specialty place near the Borough Market that had excellent homebaked breads and pastries.The hotel was not really handy to a metro/underground stop. There are several but they were all some distance. An all day pass and bus maps got us where we wanted to go and it was much more fun to see London from the top of the double decker buses.We found a good deal for this hotel by shopping around hotel websites, but be sure you check if the prices quoted are in pounds, dollars or euros. Be sure to visit the magnificent (and free) British Museum. And always, always bring comfortable shoes."
57,1160,"Jun 3 2007 	Absoultly Fab!	Lovely hotel, fab location great food, great bar, clean modern, and clean rooms and bathrooms, Great location for the shows.Definatly recommend this hotel."
58,1160,"Jun 1 2007 	Great value and good quality in London!	It's rare to find a hotel in London that is good value for money and is an honest representation of its rating (3 star). I could not fault the room - it was a good size and clean. I asked for a quiet non-smoking room and was not dissapointed.I got a good rate through centralr.com for one night (90) and got an even better rate at the desk when I extended our stay for an extra night (68 - although they had to be gently persuaded). Car parking worked out at 14 per day (round the back - access from Thrale Street).We did not use the restaurant, but the small bar area was smokey (roll on July 1st when England bans smoking in enclosed public spaces!). You can get breakfast in the hotel for an extra charge but we walked round the corner to the Bramah Tea museum (Southwark Street under the railway bridge) and had tea and toasted teacakes there. There are a few other places around borough market as well.We stayed at the Southwark Rose for easy access to the Tate Modern, but the main South Bank attractions are only about 20 minutes walk along the river.We will certainly stay there again."
59,1160,"Apr 27 2007	Nice accommodations - surly staff	We stayed at the Southwark in June of 2005 -- the rooms were spacious and the bathrooms the largest of any of our accommodations in England. Everything was quite clean. But... the front desk staff was unfriendly bordering on rudeness. Simple questions were answered brusquely and dismissively. Hopefully in the ensuing time this problem has been solved, as the location and accommodations are terrific!"
60,1160,"Apr 20 2007 	Recommended for short business stay	Chosen for its proximity to Waterloo station, the hotel was good for a single night business stay.Check in was fairly quick, although the double I'd booked the week before wasnt available so had to be content with a two single bed room. Although clean, the room itself was small and not particularly inviting. Definitely not a room you'd want to linger in after a late night out with breakfast in bed. One big plus was the surprising availability of cabs at 05:30 for the short drive to the Eurostar terminal at Waterloo.Ultimately I'd recommend for a short business, or good budget touriststay. This may well be a boutique hotel, but its definitely not of the 'hip' variety."
61,1160,"Apr 1 2007 	Modern and minimalist.	A second recent business stay at the Southwark Rose. It is hard to find a quiet hotel in London - but stay in a room at the rear &amp; you will find a quiet night. Food is plain, home cooked with a limited menu choice, but plentiful &amp; tasty. Staff a little frosty &amp; the place lacks any character. The facillities are basic but okay for a one night stay. Overall a sterile feel to the place - no atmosphere - but no complaints either."
62,1160,"Feb 12 2007 	No blankets no wake up call no service	I generally don't ask for much from a hotel, and I have traveled all over Europe. But the Southwark Rose sinks to new lows, unworthy of a hotel in a capital city. The rooms actually are quite nice and the beds very comfy. But the front desk neglected to give me my wake-up call the first morning and were unapologetic about my missing an important business meeting. When I requested a blanket that evening, the staff took my information and never brought a blanket or told me it was not coming. Much of the staff has only a passing knowledge of the English language so communication is dicey. I would recommend the hotel only if you are entirely self-sufficient and in need of a bed and shower only. The breakfast is inedible and the location is pretty remote."
63,1160,"Feb 12 2007 	great stay at the Southwark Rose	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a theatre break . We arrived at Heathrow and on advice from a trip advisor member we took the Piccadilly line changed at Hammersmith to the district line and got off at Mansion house. Take 2 right turns out of the station and walk over the Southwark bridge the hotel is a five minute walk after the bridge .If you are worried about getting lost this is the most straight forward route.Check in was quick and easy and i had a non-smoking room on the second floor.The hotel is very modern the rooms were on the small side but spotlessly clean which in my view is more important than a huge room. The bathroom was equally small but the shower was brilliant. We had a continental breakfast which was the usual type of food, cereal, toast etc we never had to queue for breakfast despite the hotel being busy. This has to be one of the quietest hotel rooms i have ever stayed in despite our room facing the road we heard very little noise, none of the usual door slamming and dragging of luggage.As for eating out in the area there are several restaraunts on both sides underneath the bridge. Pizza , Greek and Portugese to name a few. If you are looking for a hotel in the centre of London then this hotel is not for you but we were happy to walk and use the tube system which was very easy to follow. Overall i would denfinately use this hotel again and had a lovely break. We went to see The Sound of Music which was excellant."
64,1160,"Jan 30 2007 	Ok bit of a mess up with the booking	This review could have been better. We booked this hotel for NYE and booked it well in advance at a special rate. When we checked in they tried to charge is the standard rate which for NYE was a lot more. The girl on checkout tried for a short while to say this was the rate and we had to pay it but the manager did amend this hassle free shortly after.Then when we went to our room and discovered they had given us a smoking room when we booked non-smoking and it stank so much (anyone who doesn't smoke would know the thought of having to sleep in a smoking room is not nice)We went back to reception to change rooms and were told that all the non smoking rooms were booked and all that was left was smoking so we had no choice but to try another room and see if it stank as bad as the previous one. We had to make do in a smoking room which is not good if you don't smoke and I was not impressed by this.Other than this the hotel is fine, lobby is nice and rooms are ok, the bar on the 6th floor is nice.Location is good easy walking distance from the tourist attractions.I would probably not stay here again, club quarters in St Pauls is half the price and the same standard.Although this is a negative review don't be totally put off the hotel is clean and location good and if you get a good rate it would be fine!"
65,1160,Jan 16 2007 	Modern hotel	We stayed at the Southwark Rose for 1 night while on a theatre break. The reception area was quiet and modern but the staff were not particulary welcoming. The room was quiet but pretty small. The bathroom was lovely with very good shower. The beds were very hard! Overall we enjoyed are stay and we had a good deal from superbreaks. I would however stay nearer to Covent Garden if I were to come again.
66,1160,"Dec 20 2006 	Superb Stay	Stayed here at the beginning of December and absolutely loved the hotel. I had booked it for a group of 12 and everyone was delighted with the choice. The rooms were spotlessly clean and ideal for us, particularly as the price was so reasonable. We ate in the restaurant and the food was good. The staff were all friendly. Would definitely stay here again."
67,1160,"Dec 11 2006 	Usurped	I would like to give this hotel a positive review but I can't. When we arrived to check-in we were told that the hotel was overbooked by 20 rooms, the reservation had been made 2 months earlier.We were marched to another hotel that was not our choice. This incident was very disappointing because the hotel had been selected for its good reviews on Trip Advisor.Confirmation of a booking is no guarantee of a room in this hotel!"
68,1160,"Nov 3 2006 	Modern and Convenient Hotel	We stayed here after reading the reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel was modern and clean with helpful staff, not that we had to bother them much. It was in a great location - A couple of minutes walk to the Tate Modern on one side and London Bridge station on the other side. My only criticism would be that the rooms were on the small side but we didn't spend too much time there, too busy sightseeing."
69,1160,"Nov 1 2006 	Not bad for London	We booked directly with the hotel as it was the cheapest quote. Overall, i think it was fair value in a good location. Pity about the lack of parking facilities and the breakfast was mediocre but otherwise it was okay. The staff were a bit lazy and unhelpful but, overall as far as London hotels are concerned it provides good value in an okay position for anyone either doing business or visiting central London"
70,1160,"Oct 28 2006	Clean and neat	Booked this hotel for 1 night having read the reviews here. A lovely hotel. Very clean, staff very hospitable, breakfast very good. All in all, an excellently priced hotel and would stay there again."
71,1160,"Oct 15 2006 	Great location and fantastic value for money	I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on here - it was for a surprise trip to London for my boyfriend's birthday so it needed to be great, but also within a certain budget. Well, it was even better than I expected, especially for a 3 star rated hotel. The staff were courteous, although we didn't really have to say much to them other than to check in and check out. At breakfast, they were fairly brisk, but not impolite and I noticed that they were very helpful to other guests who did have queries.The room itself actually looked exactly like it does on the pictures (I was beginning to think this was unheard of) - it was clean, and spacious and the bathroom was clean and well designed. The shower was excellent too (i've never used such a powerful shower in a 3 star hotel!) The blackout blind is a thoughtful and useful touch to the room. I found it to be nice and quiet when we got back (at about 2.30am) and with the blind down a restful night's sleep was easily achieved.We didn't use the restaurant other than at breakfast time so I can't comment on the general menu. However, I highly recommend the breakfast - the continental breakfast was varied and continually refilled, even near the end of the breakfast period (which incidentally runs to 11am at weekends, which is gratefully received when you stay out until the middle of the night!) My boyfriend turned down the offer of upgrading to the full breakfast as he'd assumed it was also served buffet style (we've had this happen before, and it really wasn't worth it, very poor quality) but we later discovered it is actually cooked to order and looks delicious, so if you're tempted, from what other reviewers say too, then go for it!I had initially worried about the location but it was actually fantastic having great access to London's South Bank, the London Eye etc, and it didn't take too long to walk into more central areas of London. (So it's a great spot for seeing London as a tourist) It is also only about 5 mins walk to the London Bridge tube station which of course means you're instantly connected to the rest of London anyway.I recommend this hotel very highly!"
72,1160,"Sep 22 2006 	worst hotel I have ever stayed in in London over 25 yers	Welcome: very poor; it was 30degress outside, I was struggling with luggage through the revolving door only one working) three healthy young women in reception watching but not helping (I am 60). Another guest had to help me. When challanged on this hotel management said they don't provide this service (it would mean the tarriff wouldhave to be increased!) but &quot;staff would help if asked&quot;. This was not my experience.Dealing with problems: There was a phone charge on my account for four minutes to a number I did not know. As a matter of principle I do not use hotel phones: I prefer my mobile. When this charge appeared I asked to have it investigated. instead I was told that I was in the room at the time and their rechnoolgoy was never wrong: so I would have to pay. The other technology advantage they advertised were in-room safes. The safe in my room did not work. On enquiring I was told that it had stopped working some time before and they decided not to re-activate it in case it failed again.!!Management of the complaint: Dissatisfied with the attitude of the staff and my experiences at checkout (the phone bill and the implication that I had lied about the phone) I asked to see the Manager. He was too busy to see me then; I offered to return later that day, my plane left that evening, but he would be too busy to see me at that time too!!Finally on my return home I lodged a complaint with the booking agent; after three attempts to get a responnse and weeks later, I was told (not by the elusive manager, but one of his staff) that I should have asked for help and that because I was in the room at the time I must have made the call. (Is it possible that I can make phone calls and not remember?)The hotel was clean and the ariconditioning worked"
73,1160,"Jul 24 2006	Had a lovely stay at the Southwark Rose	We were visiting london for the weekend and booked this hotel online via their website. It was below average price for b&amp;b in central london and also offered VERY cheap parking.The hotel is verystylish and modern. The staff are helpful and efficient, and we had a swift check-in and check-out. The rooms are small, but have everything you need, including electric blinds (very exciting!) and steam free mirrors in the bathroom!The bed is lovely with a giant square pattern headboard. It is very clean, well kept and very inviting. We were going for tea at the ritz so were only going to have a small breakfast, but with the massive selection ot tasty cold meats, cereals, yoghurts, juices and spreads, we ate a huge breakfast - it was delicious!Would recommend as a romantic break, or just as a place to stay in london. Oter reviewers are right,. its not that central, but it is only 2 minutes from london bridge tube station so we had no problem getting around.highly recommended - book on their website for discounts on rates!"
74,1160,"Jun 12 2006 	Clean clinical modern quiet	The Southwark Rose is located on Southwark Bridge Road, which is quite busy but is surprisingly quiet after about 10 PM. If you want guaranteed quiet ask for a room at the rear of the hotel. The hotel is well placed, but a little out from the main attractions, but good tube &amp; travel comnnections mean this is not a problem. Reception staff are coolly efficient and the whole place feels like a modern private hospital - clean, clinical and no frills - no real ambience - but high quality and peaceful . Food is good, plentiful and freshly cooked. Overall a quaity place - if you are on business or visiting and want quiet, quality accomodation with a bit of class you will be well satisfied here."
75,1160,"Apr 29 2006	Glad we stayed here. Great location for the south bank.	We don't mind a bit of walking so this hotel was ideal for us. Modern /quiet /clean/near enough the National Theatre to walk back at night. The walk way by the Thames was pleasant at all times of the day or evening. I'd stay here again. You may upgrade from the Continental breakfast for 4, and get the cooked breakfast which was different from anything I had seen before. Almost a work of art with a frill on top!! In the middle of the plate you have a scewer of gammon steak, steak, and a huge cumberland sausage which was delicious. All sorts of breakfast items served with it. More a main meal than a breakfast. Would be adequate for anyone. We went back to the Continental for our 2nd and third morning, it was very good too. As others have said the bed is very firm, but not a problem for us. We found the staff very nice and attentive. I would recommend a visit to the Gilbert Collection at Summerset house, I drooled over the fantastic collection of ABOUT 200 jewel encrusted snuff boxes for ages. The history behind some of them was captivating. The Collection is on the opposite riverside from the hotel just a short distance from the actual Sommerset house entrance. the building in the photo is worth having a walk round. It's nicknamed the Gherkin, actual name 30 saint Mary's Wynde. The other location was within reasonable walking distance to the hotel, I think it tooka leisurley about 25 minutes."
76,1160,Apr 13 2006	A Gem	Just back from a fantastic weekend in London.The Southwark Rose Hotel is a lovely clean and friendly hotel.The room was immaculate and the breakfast is well worth the 8.99 for buffet style which includes full fry.All the tourist attractions are within easy walking distance and the tube and train station are also so close.Would highly reccomend this hotel and we are looking forward to our next visit.
77,1160,"Jan 30 2006	Amazing Value; Not Perfect	Unlike the previous reviewer, I did not think that the location of the Southwark Rose was too inconvenient. If I wanted to be right in the middle of things, I would have shelled out the extra 100 pounds to stay there. Instead, the Southwark Rose is a clean, contemporary hotel in a quiet area within easy walking distance of the London Bridge tube station. All at an unbelievable value (we paid 105).I found the staff to be friendly enough (the girl at the desk remembered later at checkout that I had mentioned that my last visit to London was 20 years ago and she asked how my most recent visit was - a nice touch), but not over the top good. Pretty consistent with this type of hotel and star rating.As I expected, the room was small but comfortable. The finish out was modest and contemporary - with a simple and clean stylishness to it. The door to the bathroom was cleverly done such that you could close off only the toilet or the entire bathroom depending on the level of privacy demanded. My only nit was that the TV was tiny and the channel selection was pretty limited. But since I did not go to London to watch the TV, I really cannot complain.Okay, so the Soutwark Rose is not perfect, but for all that it offers at a 50% relative discount to similar quality hotels in the city, I will stay there every time I return to London."
78,1160,"Jan 28 2006	Decent enough hotel shame about the location	We stayed in this hotel for a weekend out in London, for 6 people.The hotel is pretty decent. Decent room size (for London, anyway), decent bathroom with a good shower, decent staff (they were fairly pleasant to us, we didn't experience the problems of other members).The room, decor and experience fits pretty well with its 3 star rating. I'd say that's quite accurate.However, the biggest problem for us was the location.It's a 15 minute walk to the nearest tube station which may not sound a lot, but it's a pain in the rear when you want to go out shopping or out for the night, when the tubes close at just gone midnight or you have a load of bags to carry back to your room.It's right near the Financial Times building, and the area is DEAD (although, if you follow the stairs down next to the FT building, there's a nice restaurant area with a Nandos and a few other trendy looking places).If you want to be in the heart of the action- and by that, I mean Leicester Square, Picadilly Circus, Oxford Street, etc- I would not recommend this place unless you like walking or don't mind calling a cab everywhere you want to go.All in all, it'll take you about 30-40 minutes to get to each of these places with the walking, the tube changes, etc. Again, this may be fine for some people- but for a group who just wanted to go out shopping and out for the night, it was a bit of an inconvenience.The hotel itself is decent enough, but there are a few niggles that were a little frustrating...1. Using the Internet wirelessly was very expensive- 13 pounds for a 24 hour pass. That's about $20-- and the connection was VERY slow, too... almost dial-up at times (they have free Internet access upstairs using their own computers, though-- but it's not the same if you need to download your email or work from your own laptop).2. There was no room service. They DO have a bar/restaurant upstairs, but that stops serving their full menu pretty early- and up to 2am, you can only get chips, onion rings and other crappy foods.3. Their restaurant service in the early evening was STUPIDLY SLOW. My friend and I ordered a burger- and with just 1 other table occupied in the restaurant, it took them *45 minutes* to bring the food to the table (and even then, they forgot the side orders-- which took an additional 15 minutes).And believe me, the food was NOT worth waiting for (or the 30 pound bill that came with it!)4. The rooms was decently decorated, but there were scuff marks on the walls, and little things like the toilet roll holder hanging off its hinges annoyed me. These kinds of things should be checked regularly and resolved- it's not a big deal.5. The staff messed up my reservation. I told them, via phone (twice) and during check-in (a further 2 times) that we wanted 1 double room and 1 suite for the first night and 2 doubles and 1 twin the second, because another member of our party was coming that 2nd night and it made sense.A fairly simple request, you would think, but it caused a great deal of confusion for them. They asked me to a) phone them to confirm this, b) confirm this via email... and then on the Saturday morning, two of the rooms still got calls to check-out, when I had told them 4 times previously that we would be simply switching rooms and NOT checking out until the Sunday.They charged it all to my card, as requested, and the amounts were eventually right-- however, when I got home, I received an email saying that 2 of our party didn't show... how they came to that conclusion, I have no idea.Overall, a decent enough hotel with fairly decent rates (we paid 75 pounds per room, per night- except for the suite, which was 120)-- but the location and the room for improvement would very likely mean that I won't be returning there in the future."
79,1160,"Dec 27 2005 	Modern and confi but with awful staff	A very modern hotel South of the river in what used to be a run-down neighborhood some years ago. The area still keeps its dark side in some parts but one is very close to the Tate, the London bridge and Waterloo. My wife and I felt very safe walking from the tube to the hotel at night, with just a couple of weirdos asking for cigarrets, but nothing different from NY or Chicago. I always stay nearby the Soho while travelling for business, due to the proximity to my office, but most hotels over there are just outrageously expensive for what you get. The Rose is modern, well located, clean and confortable. Sure, the rooms are not as big as one is used to in the US, but excellent for London standards. The restaurant is quite good for a couple of days if one does not want to dinne outside. In summary, a fair deal. The only caveat: part of the staff is very unpolite and not at all helpful. Also the service tends to be very slow and not corteous when they are under pressure. But, if you do not need to talk to them, who cares?"
80,1160,Nov 17 2005	near the tate modern	A great hotel at a great price (buy via lastminute) very convenient for the tate modern 5 minute stroll along the thames. The room was modern very clean and had everything we needed. As with alot of hotels the breakfast is overpriced if you just want the basics - but you can get that somewhere else.
81,1160,"Nov 2 2005	Excellent value	Stayed for 2 nights this last weekend.I chose this place based on previous reviews here,and that it was cheapest,65GBP per room,booked direct with hotel.Modern,clean hotel,easy access to tube and mainline stations.Bedroom ok size wise,clean,and quite trendy.Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby,as well things to see and do.I thought this hotel was very good value for money,and I would definately stay again."
82,1160,"Oct 28 2005	Nice hotel	Stayed at this hotel because of its location. Room was not very big, but clean and very modern feel. The whole hotel is very modern. I agree the staff was not the best. They seemed to not know the area and did not have much initiative. There are some food places nearby and it is a short walk to the tube station. No internet in the room, but free interent in the bar/restaurant on 2 PC's. One was down while I was there, but I was able to plug my laptop in and use it. Very nice hotel."
83,1160,"Oct 23 2005 	Will stay here again very nice!	I recently stopped at this hotel when in town for a meeting in Canary Wharf. The hotel cost me 100 per night which I thought was a bargain for the standard of accommodation I experienced. On past visits to the city I have paid more and received a poor quality of hotel. The reception is very trendy, all black and white photography and stylish dcor. My room was on the fourth floor. The room was an average size for a London hotel. The bathroom did not have a bath but did hold a very impressive and contemporary shower. The bedrooms were very stylish and cleverly designed. The window even had an electronic black out blind instead of curtains!The room was very clean, had internet access for my laptop and a TV which had UK satellite channels you would not normally find in a hotel (e.g. E4).The hotel restaurant is on the top floor. I ate there for my evening meal and breakfast with my colleagues. The food/drink choice and quality is good and excellent value for money. The top floor also had an area with a huge plasma screen to watch TV. This was very popular as an England football match was on when I stayed. When I checked out for my meeting in Canary Wharf, it was very easy to get a taxi and was only a 15 minute cab ride away. I will definitely be stopping here again when I am in London for business. However if you are in London for pleasure you need to be nearer to the centre. I would recommend a hotel based within Holborn!"
84,1160,"Sep 29 2005	Good value for money	A quite nice place to stay considering what you usually get for these prices in London. The hotel is modern, everything is clean and confortable to use (bathroom, shower...). I recommend it for those who can't afford to much but still want to avoid flea-pits..."
85,1160,"Sep 21 2005	A nice surprise	I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for one night during a quick trip to London. The hotel is easily accessible from London Bridge Tube station, the rooms are modern, clean and airy, and the shower is wonderful! We had a lovely dinner in the restaurant where there was an offer on for a three course meal for 14.95 and all drinks were on 2 for 1. In a city where I regularly feel somewhat ripped off, this was a really pleasant surprise. I read previous reviews saying the staff were unhelpful and unfriendly, but I didn't find this to be the case - I suppose it depends what you are asking of them, but my check in and out went very smoothly, they arranged a taxi for me with no problems and the staff in the restaurant were very polite, even if they were still working on their English! All in all a great experience, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend."
86,1160,"Aug 25 2005 	some weird staff nice location	Nice, stylish, clean, but don't expect any internet in the room or any gusto from the staff to do something about this. first they told me to call T-mobile myself, then someone else said that it hadn't been working in a long time and that that probably wouldn't change for some time to come. Also rather funny: when asking directions to Waterloo station (which is supposed to be really nearby) the girl at the reception told me she had no clue. When I just checked in I was also chased out of my room in horror by an awful piercing sound. On asking at reception they informed me dryly to be 'testing the fire alarm'. Just the sound of it. Thanks for not warning me...Slept like a baby otherwise, and for every rather weird member of staff they also have a very friendly and helpfull one working there. Loved being so close to Tate modern and the Thames. Liked the smell of the hallways... Would go again, but maybe wouldn't bother to bring my laptop."
87,1160,"Aug 1 2005	Excellent Hotel For A Great Price	My family of four stayed for 1 week at the Southwark Rose Hotel in London. This is an excellent hotel in a great location, south of the Thames River and near the Southwark Bridge and London Bridge. We stayed in a family suite which included 2 rooms with a queen size bed in one room and a sofa bed in the other. Both rooms were equipped with their own television, telephone, large window, closets, tables, chairs and shelves. The rooms are good sized and our family suite also included a small kitchen with a refrigerator, microwave, sink and dishes which was perfect for breakfast and eating a light supper. There was also a bathroom which consisted of 2 rooms with a toliet in one and the other had a big beautiful shower and sink. Toiletries and hair dryers were provided by the hotel. The room was immaculate, cleaned every day, dishes washed, fresh towels, beds made, just an excellent value for the $$. The rooms are also very, very quiet. We never heard sounds from the hallways or other guest rooms and the best thing was we never heard the noise of the tv or radio from our teenage daughter's connecting room at night. The hotel is in an excellent location. The nearest tube is the London Bridge stop on the new Jubilee line and is a 5 minute walk. Ask at the desk for a shortcut to the tube. (If you go out the back door of the hotel through the parking lot it's a short walk.) We didn't figure it out until the 3rd or 4th day of our stay. Many London attractions are within walking distance. You can easily walk to the Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe Theater, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London. We even walked along the Jubilee Promenade (on the south side of the Thames River) to the House of Parliament, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace. This is a longer walk but beautiful scenery if you take your time. There are many restaurants along the river near the hotel and even grocery stores.Another plus is the Borough Market which is under the London Bridge and sells fresh produce and baked goods. The hotel also provides free internet/e-mail access on a computer in the restaurant. This we really appreciated because we were in London during the terrorist attacks and could e-mail family. We booked this hotel as a package through cheap fares (an Expedia branch) but you can book directly online with the hotel also. I will definitely stay at the Southwark Rose again and highly recommend this hotel."
88,1160,"Jul 21 2005	Great place to stay	We stayed at the Southwark Rose in late June/early July 2005. It was a very comfortable place for our family of four (mom, dad, son age 20, son age 12). We had a suite which consisted of a bedroom, sitting room with fold out couch bed, small kitchenette (sink, micro, small fridge) and a very comfortable bath with shower (no tub -- which was fine with us). The area was easy to get around, London Bridge tube and rail station were about 1/2 mi walk away. There is a nice (though pricey) restaurant upstairs. They serve a decent continental buffet breakfast (not included in our room) including yogurt, cereals, breakfast breads, meats, cheeses and fruit. Don't order bruschetta -- unless you like a half hamburger bun topped with margarine and a tomato slice! The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful, but not necessarily knowledgable about the area. We needed to do laundry during our stay, but the staff couldn't find a laundromat (laundrette), though they tried to check online. We did find a laundrette on Long Lane, (asked a lot of locals before we found it!) about a mile from the hotel, but take a rolling suitcase to haul the clothes. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel for a short or long stay."

1,1162,Great hotel!	The hotel manager was very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and very well equipped. It was quiet but with 100 yards of great restaurants and bars. There are also lots of local shops. Perfect location for travel in and around London. EXPEDIA hadn't booked us in - even though we had had a confirmation! The Manager sorted all of this out for us - completely hassle free. I would suggest booking direct - with as much notice as possible as this is a busy cool hotel.
2,1162,"Nov 6 2009 	Great location warning about rooms	The hotel location was great for us. The neighborhood has many great restaurants and mini-marts within a 5 block walk. It's less than a 10 minute walk to two tube stations and to Hyde park. If you have little ones, you're right next to the Diana Memorial Playground in Hyde Park, which is so popular that sometimes there is a queue to get in. It's not near the major tourist areas (the museums, shopping, Eye of London, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben), but most can be accessed via the tube, a GBP 10-15 taxi ride, or a 20-30 minute stroll through Hyde Park.While the rooms range in size, many are quite large by London standards, with a good amount of storage, a full kitchen with microwave, dishwasher, fridge, and washer/dryer packed into each unit. [The *SLOWEST* washer/dryer I've seen. Each load took about 5 hours!]The hotel does not provide much service. No pool, no food, no fitness, nothing. While the person at the front desk was friendly, think of it more as an apartment than a full-service hotel. As such, the hotel does not serve any food. With a full kitchen, and so many places nearby to eat, this was not a problem for us. [Pret a Manger, around the corner on Queensway, was a good place for breakfast, with real drip coffee and good pastries and sandwiches.]One warning with this hotel: since it is a renovated apartment, not built originally as a hotel, each room is different. Some are much better than others. So if you care which rooms you will stay in, you need to confirm with hotel which rooms are the available. The rooms are listed by number of people allowed. While rooms for more people *tend* to be bigger, there are some 2-person rooms that are bigger than some 3 person apartments. They are upfront about this, and their website lists the size of each room.The only serious problem we encountered was with the initial room we were assigned. They have three &quot;quadruple&quot; rooms. While the name sounds good (better than a triple, right?), the rooms have a mezzanine level, with the bed on an upper level with a very steep and narrow staircase-of-death without any side protection going up to the bed. And the ceiling is only about 3 feet above the bed. If you book a Triple, they might try to put you in the &quot;quadruple&quot; without telling you. Which is what they did to us, with a 2-year old that loves climbing stairs. It took 30 minutes of arguing and threatening to sue before we got a different room, one that was more appropriate to a child. So if you don't want this room, you need to check which room you are getting and check their website.While this hotel probably deserves 5*, I can't bring myself to do that, since they tried to put us into the quadruple room. Eventually we did change, to a very nice triple, but if we couldn't have moved it would have ruined the stay."
3,1162,"Nov 4 2009 	Made our London experience great	We enjoyed our stay at the Space Apart Hotel from the moment we arrived.The rooms were extremely clean. The kitchenettes were fully equipped, even in the smaller of our 2 rooms.Yes, the rooms are small . . . this is London . . . but they are far superior when compared to similar lodgings we have had in New York, Tokyo or Paris.Though our rooms were in the basement, both were bright.Location is excellent, only a few minutes walk from 2 of the main underground lines. Restaurants, grocery stores, small shops abound. And on Saturday within not-so-far walking distance from the market on Portobello Road.When we next visit London, we hope to stay here again."
4,1162,"Oct 30 2009 	Fantastic - clean modern and central!	This place is great, we had a basement apartment with a small outside area. It was very clean and available when we arrived early at 1pm. The appliances are clean and modern and in the apartment we had, an excellent use of space in the bathroom/wet room. You too can have a shower at the same time as having a wee!! Great location, few mins walk to Bayswater, few mins more to Queensway on the Central Line. We also walked to Paddington on our way home rather than brave the rush hour on the tube or in a taxi. This was very do-able even with a 6yr old in tow (who had walked round London all day). Really helpful guys on reception - even throwing in a few tips for our next trip to Dublin!! All in all, a great place to stay."
5,1162,"Oct 26 2009	Wonderful Accomadation	Stayed here for the last 4 nights .The apartment was excellent although there was 2 of us,we got a triple size apart. It was really worth the extra money, We had a 36&quot; plasma screen tv, electric tilting bed and all the mod cons of modern living. Sean the manager was very helpful and pleasant,and the location was great. Would highly recommend this hotel. The only downside is that there is no housekeeping service. You are SELF CATERING all the way. No fresh towels, toilet tissue,or room freshening."
6,1162,"Oct 21 2009 	What more could you ask for?	We travelled down to London in October for a short getaway and booked into the Space Apart hotels through a 3rd party. We fully researched the hotel and what to expect, we were not disappointed! We originally booked a small studio for a very reasonable London price, however upon arrival we were upgraded free of charge to a larger room which was very well received by both of us. The room was as expected with LCD TV, ipod docking station, dvd player, modern well furnished kitchen &amp; washing machine.Having a kitchen allowed us the flexibility to eat in as well as out and (as we were on a budget) this is exactly what we needed. The hotel is conveniently located near to Bayswater &amp; Queensway tube stations allowing quick and easy access to central London / all relevant tourist sites.Overall, we would 100% recommend this hotel for short and long stay travellers.....well worth the price!"
7,1162,"Oct 18 2009 	Awesome place	The rooms are small but very well designed and contain all that you need including kitchen, washer/dryer, free local calls with your own direct dial number, free wi-fi and satelitte tv. Very centrally located in zone 1 of London, 5 minutes from the Bayswater tube station which is only one stop from Paddington if you are coming in from Heathrow. Building is quiet but with loads of shops, restuaurants and markets to be handy. Only 5 min walk to Hyde Park for those who want some green space."
8,1162,"Sep 4 2009 	Fabulous - will stay here again	I stayed at Space Apart Hotel with my husband and 15-month old son, and we greatly enjoyed our stay. The location was a short walk from the Bayswater tube station on the popular Circle Line, and there were loads of restaurants, takeaways, shops, grocery stores, bakeries, etc nearby. The room was super clean, had all the amenities, and was plenty big for a baby cot. Our son had plenty of room to play, which is a big consideration for us. Dave and Sean were very helpful and whenever we needed anything - extra towels, sheet for baby cot - it arrived almost immediately. We would definitely stay here again!"
9,1162,"Aug 26 2009 	Just a couple of hiccups but otherwise almost perfect!	To start off I am a relatively frequent traveler and one of the things i do before a trip is an extensive hotel research. That being said I have a list of priorities places i look for must meet. First is cleanliness and finding out that the hotel has been recently refurbished and not on a major strip tells me that it hasn't seen too many people so everything should be pretty new. Next is decor. It is modern yet comfortable and has almost everything one might need like washer/dryer, kitchen, dining table, 2 large built in closets and plenty of room to walk around. Another important quality is location. The area described seemed to be quiet, but near plenty of restaurants, super markets, boutique stores, bus stops, 3 underground stations, and a mall (for those rainy days). Portobello Market is within a 10 minutes walk and so is Hyde Park and Kensington Park. Although this hotel is not ranked high at all it sure beat many other hotels i have stayed at. I know the reason is that it is more of a self service apartment than a &quot;hotel&quot; but the things i tend to look for in a good quality and relatively low priced places this one sure fits. So about our experience... our flight to Heathrow was delayed by 2 hrs, which was kind of a good thing because we would've arrive way too early for check in and knowing we'd be exhausted it was better to just get in close to check in time of 2 pm. We arrived at the hotel exactly at 2 after about an hour of commute from the airport. Here's where the first of the hiccups occurred... our room wasn't ready! So we left our bags there and was told to come back in 20 mins. We decided to go get some groceries at a nearby market and returned in 20 just to wait again for about another 25. The receptionist was nice and explained they were very busy that morning. I completely understand these things happen but i just was so tired. Then the receptionist takes our luggagges up and to go check on the progress then came back with good news and led us up an elevator. We found the room to be front facing, very clean and quite adorable. It was the premium which is one up from standard, which only difference is extra space. The kitchen was wonderful had everything you'd need but a coffee making machine, which was ok since there are soo many patisseries and coffee shops, plus 2 starbucks around. The next hiccup was the towels. They were dingy, kinda damp and smelled mildewy. But I solved that problem by throwing it into the washer. Oh note on washer/dryer... it washes clothes fine but doesn't dry so well. I guess it's the dual function thing which I just fixed by hanging everything up to air dry. Another side note, they do not provide dish washing liquid or laundry detergent but you can get the cheapo brand around the corner. Oh and our room didn't come with ipod dock as listed in room amenities but we had our laptop to play music from so no problems there. Plus they have a dvd library in lobby free of charge. They also have a great outdoor terrace on our floor(4th) that we sat out with a bottle of wine one night. It was lovely.All in all this was a fantastic place to stay and I will make it home base for all my future trips to London."
10,1162,"Aug 20 2009 	The perfect place for us	We arrived on 12th of August 2009 to London, on Heathrow airport. From there we have taken the Heathrow express to Paddington station and then went with the tube one station to Bayswater underground station. From there we walked to the Space Apart hotel about 3 minutes.The Apart Hotel is situated near Kensington gardens. There are 2 underground stations at 3-5 minutes walk from the hotel. One is Bayswater that gives you access to Circle Line and District Line and the other station is Quensway which is on the Central Line. The rooms are clean and modern with fully equipped kitchen, dishes, microwave oven, dish washing machine, cloth washing machine,iron,iron table,fridge, flat screen TV, DVD player, ipod Player and FREE and FAST internet wireless connection. The bathroom is clean and the pressure is great for both cold and hot water. We stayed in room 403 which is on the 4th floor (the top level) and we enjoyed our mornings coffee and cigarettes (as both of us are smokers) on a very nice common terrace. This was really a great &quot;feature&quot; for us. The Hotel has a nice elevator so you don't have to worry about getting your luggage up the stairs.We enjoyed our evenings with DVD movies. There are a lot of good movies that you can take into your room and watch them on the flat TV for free.The room was quite and nobody really bothered us. The window is wide opening and you also have air conditioning if you need.The surroundings are very nice, so are the people. There are a few groceries stores like Sainsbury's, Tesco Express and Tesco Metro around in 5-10 minutes walk distance from where you can buy all you need in order to have your lunch or breakfast ready.Overall the Space Apart Hotel is nice and cosy and Sean and Dave were very nice and helpful during all our stay.If we get back to London, will go back there for sure!Hope this was helpful and enjoy your trip!Alexandru &amp; Ailin"
11,1162,"Aug 18 2009 	U2 concert and fun in London	We regularly visit London and normally stay in the Victoria area but we fancied a change this time around.I throughly enjoyed my stay here recently with my husband whilst we were in town for the U2 concert at Wembley (which was amazing by the way!). The Space Apart Hotel was equally as good! We stayed in room 202 and it had everything that you needed and far more than any hotel room in London for similar or slightly higher price. The room was spotless from bathroom to the fridge and clean towels and toiletries were also provided. The room had more home comforts than we have at home, including a remote controlled reclining bed, very nice. The finishing of the room was to a high standard as was the other areas of the hotel. Initially the room size indicated on the website and pictures had us worried about it being too cramped but this was not an issue with adequate space for two with lots of luggage. I was impressed to find a safe in the room as well as a fully equipped kitchen including dishwasher, washing machine, toaster, kettle, fridge and a fan operated microwave, oh and a hob! The staff were extremely friendly and down to earth providing us with excellent advice at various times. The hotel also offers a free DVD library for your use on those rainy days. The location was excellent for our stay in particular as we wanted to stay in the Notting hill area close to Paddington, providing easy and fast access to both Wembley and Heathrow airport via public transport. The Space Apart Hotel is 5- 10 minutes stroll to Bayswater, Queensway and Notting hill Gate stations. There is plenty to see and do in the area ranging from Portobella road, Hyde Park, shopping, pubs, restaurants and cafes. We will certainly be staying here again on our regular visits to London as it offers excellent value for money."
12,1162,"Aug 6 2009 	Bargain place to stay in London	My friend and I stayed at the Space Aparthotel from 9th-12th June 09. We were in London to see Britney Spears at the O2 which ended up a complete let down but thats another story!! The apartment was fantastic, we were so pleased we had chosen to stay there... Room was clean and modern, perfect for a few days away with the girls. We went into one of the pubs out on the main road in Bayswater and felt that it was a bit pretentious and expensive however the latter is to be expected in London. Whilst we were there the undergroud staff were on strike which proved a massive problem for us in terms of location however had the underground been on then this would not have been a problem... I would definately stay here again, but hopefully there will be no underground strike the next time :)"
13,1162,"Aug 5 2009 	Lots of space in great location	We enjoyed this hotel a great deal and would stay there again if we return to London. it is very modern, clean, conveniently located and reasonably priced. We found that many other hotels in London have higher rates even though they are dated and run-down. We stayed in the &quot;premium studio&quot; for a couple nights. The room was quite large for a hotel room. It was much like a studio apartment. Against one wall was the TV, DVD player and kitchen (zebra wood cupboards with all necessities, sink, dishwasher, fridge, cooktop). They also provide a little table with a couple chairs and a washer/dryer tucked into a closet. This is particularly handy for those staying longer than just a couple days as I understand they do not provide daily linen service. The bathroom is very clean and modern with a great rainhead shower and heated towel rack. I discovered that the bed was even motorized. You can use a remote control to adjust the head up or down. Wireless internet was included. They even have a little collection of DVDs on the main floor for you to watch during your stay.The hotel is located near Queensway and Bayswater tube stations and is a very short walk from Notting Hill and Portobello Road. There are some great restaurants near the hotel. It is a refurbished Georgian building set back from the busy street. Although we took a 5 minute cab ride to Paddington station from the hotel on the morning we checked out, it was only because it was raining hard. I'm guessing it would have been about a 15 minute walk with our roller bags.The only issue that might be an inconvenience for some people is that they don't provide daily linen service. However, you are provided with a washer/dryer in your room. It wasn't an issue for us as we were only there for a couple days. Also, they do not have a group of people manning the front desk - no room service. However, we weren't there for room service and the fellow working the front desk was polite and helpful so we didn't feel we were missing anything."
14,1162,"Jul 22 2009 	Self Catering with Style	This is a modern yet affordable alternative to hotels. Great for kids as the Lady Diana Playground in Kensington Gardens is only about 10 min walk away. Also great location for Portabello Rd Market. Sean, the manager, was very helpful and accommodating."
15,1162,"Jun 29 2009 	Excellent Overall Experience	Went twice over the Christmas/New Year period of 2008/2009. Will be going again this September.Rooms were clean and big enough, location excellent, fully equipped kitchenette and in-room washing machine (!) were very useful, in-room internet access was great...Most of all the staff were fabulous - friendly, accommodating, helpful in the many little but important things. Thanks very much Klaus and Sean for everything! See you soon :)"
16,1162,"Jun 27 2009 	Clean modern hotel in a great location	I stayed here in August 2008 with my wife. The hotel had recently been renovated and was very clean. This is in a fantastic location for Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and close to a couple of underground stations. There are numerous food outlets (markets and restaurants) nearby. It is quite an expensive part of town but hey - It is London after all!The Cons: Toilet door a mix of transparent and frosted glass...not very romantic! The shower head is positioned in a way that made it difficult to breathe whilst showering.I definitely would stay here again though."
17,1162,"Jun 17 2009 	Stylish Sexy and classy!!	I just adored this apart/hotel, it was so classy for our Ladies Trip to see Britney Spears!! The staff were so helpful to all our needs&amp; made our trip much more easier with all our questions &amp; singing ha haThe deco is beautiful &amp; so classy, a dream hoilday get away. 5 of us stayed and we had 2 triple Rooms, great views too, close to the tubes, shops&amp; the park.Will defo recommend this to all my freinds&amp;would love to come back with my partner!!"
18,1162,"May 26 2009 	Great Place to stay Local to everything	Would stay here again, in a great spot to the Bayswater Tube, nice resturants and bars around the hotel.Hotel clean and Trendy, staff very helpfull, room has all you need to cook for yourself, very well laid out.No need to take towels shampoo or shower gel all provided for you, anything you want to know just mail me and i will help as much as i can.Keep up the good work Space hotel"
19,1162,"Apr 24 2009 	My Kids Love the Clean and Modern Decor	I stayed here for four days with 2 preteen kids. Apart from it being a studio flat, I absolutely love it because it is still new and clean. Since I love to cook for my kids, the kitchennette was what I was after. But since it is a studio layout, I fear the food smell will stay on my work clothes. I took the apartment anyway because I wanted to exit from the previous apartment which I stayed in for 7days plus this one was very convenient and straight forward to book online. There is nothing sceptical about the whole procedure compared with one I was supposed to check into that same day (but I cancelled). This place is also far less noisy than my former lodging, got internet wifi and shops are plenty nearby including the cinema. I do not mind the the shower cubicle, it was bigger than most standard ones and though at first I was very uncomfortable about the monsoon type shower, but yes, the shower cap did help. However, it would be much more convenient for some people like me if we have a choice to hand hold the shower. It seems likely I may come back to stay again but since I love to try out new and cheaper lodgings to suit my budget at times, it will be some time then."
20,1162,"Apr 21 2009 	Great place to stay	Spent 4 nights there last week (April 13th 2009). My friend and I each had a studio apartment. Well equipped, clean and I loved the decor. Staff were really friendly and helpful - I'd definitely recommend it as a good base for exploring London. Very handy for the tube and lots of pubs/restaurants/shops in the immediate vicinity"
21,1162,"Mar 26 2009 	Offers everything you're looking for in a London hotel	I stayed in Space for a weekend in March and was extremely impressed with both the rooms and the overall service . The personal service offered by the staff was by far the best ive experienced in any hotel. The managers Sean and Klaus were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Although there is no bar in the hotel, they were more than willing to recommend several bars and restaurants, the furthest of which was approx 10mins walk from the hotel. The decor while not to everyones taste was fantastic and makes quite an impression in comparison to the typical plain decor found in most hotels. I am planning on travelling to London quite a bit over the next few months and will definately be looking up Space again."
22,1162,"Mar 20 2009 	Over-designed with little soul	I'm sure this would be a great place to stay if you were in London for a few nights and wanted to self-cater, but it wasn't a great choice for a single overnight - no bar, no breakfast facilities etc. Had a very distinctive design style which I found a bit overwhelming and soul-less. It also had my most hated hotel feature - a rain shower in a small cubical, meaning you can't avoid washing your hair whether you want to or not."
23,1162,"Dec 21 2008 	Nice stylish hotel in great location with excellent staff	This is a nice hotel, recently remodeled in a contemporary design. All of the rooms are small furnished apartments. We were only able to get their smallest sized studio apartment (called a standard). They have an awesome virtual tour on their website. I noticed that most of the standard rooms are really designed to accomodate 1 person in the bed. I called ahead to request a room that had two nightstands and allowed ample area for two people to get in/out of the bed at night. They had 1 such room still available and were nice enough to say that while they couldn't guarantee it, they would try to hold one like that for me. When we arrived (a little early) they were just finishing cleaning the special room. Yay!MAIN ROOM/KITCHENETTEOur room (a standard room) had a bed, armoire, nightstands, flat screen TV, DVD player, table, chairs, kichenette with stovetop, microwave/oven, sink, electric kettle, refrigerator, plates, pots, utencils and glassware. BATHROOMThere was a small bathroom with a toilet, sink and shower. Soap, shampoo/conditioner, towels and a hair dryer were provided as well as few other things like cotton swaps, etc. PROS* centrally located - walk 5 minutes to 3 differnt tube lines* great location - walking distance to excellent food, pubs* great location - you're in a neighborhood with locals, it's not jammed full of tourists* kitchenette - I love having the fridge, kettle and stove. * Free wi-fi (some hotels charge $10/day for this* THE STAFF WERE AWESOME, FRIENDLY, EFFICENT* A good price compared to other options in the area* Adjustable bed to sit up while watching TV, using computer* Very clean, well kept and remodelled in 2007OK - I had to give the place 4 instead of 5 stars for the following (long winded) reasons:CONS* Really small sometimes illogical use of space. You can tell they did their best to fit what they could into the existing floorplan of the hotel during the remodel, but in some spaces there was less than 2 feet between the bed and a wall or a table. Our table and chairs were pretty much unusable, which made it hard to use them to eat (we gave up and ate in bed). The area between the toilet and icy window was about a foot and a half. The only mirror in the bathroom was above and behind the toilet (not the sink) which made it ackward to shave, apply makeup, brush teeth, etc. There was no actual door that closed off the bathroom, just a sliding glass door that didn't properly close. As we were staying for only a week this wasn't a huge deal, but if I were staying for 2 or 3 weeks I wouldn't like it.* Poor quality insulation made it really, really cold even with the heater on. The temps in Britain in the evening were between 20-30F. The windows had not been remodeled or weatherproofed and were so drafty as to make the room quite cold. The huge leeky window in the bathroom (about two feet from the toilet seat) was exceptionally bad and not a very pleasant place to have to visit in the middle of the night. &lt;BRRRRRRR!&gt;* Noisy if you are on the 1st floor/reception area (we had a lot of people coming and going at all hours who shouted as soon as they walked in the door. The front and hall doors were hinged so they always slammed closed - they need to install one of those mechanisms that gently closes the main door as many times this woke me up out of a deep sleep.* Bed linens were clean, but not of high quality material - kind of scratchy. I wouldn't note this but if you look at the pics on the hotel website, the linens look really high quality. They appear nice, but don't have a high thread count or good material. (Oh, and for US folks, they don't use a top sheet, only a bottom sheet + comforter which is a european style but just FYI)The cons were only a few and were easily worked around. Because of the excellent location, atmosphere and staff I would absolutely stay there again, but I would get the larger sized room on the 2nd or higher floor."
24,1162,"Oct 28 2008 	Excellent Location	Excellent location, clean rooms, friendly staff, free wi fi, reasonably priced. You are situated 5 minutes from Hyde Park and about a 30 minute walk (few minutes on a tube) to Oxford Street. Plenty to do around the area."
25,1162,"Oct 26 2008 	Hidden Gem in Central London	We stayed in Space Apart Hotel for 12 nights back in September. Initially we only booked for 5 nights as we were a bit wary because there were not any reviews for the hotel. Chanced upon this hotel in citybase apartments website. Turned out the hotel was one of our best experiences in Europe.1. The hotel is brand new  it was only opened in July, so it was really really clean! It is an apartment hotel and each room is smartly designed and comes with kitchen facilities, fridge, toaster, stove, kettle, dishwasher, washing machine + dryer, LCD TV, iPod dock, safety box. Perfect for us since we were travelling for 1 month (washing machine and dryer is a blessing!) We stayed for 5 nights in studio room for 100 pounds/night and the remaining in the larger one, premium room for 120 pounds/night. Very very reasonable rate in central London. Both are very comfortable rooms, but we will choose premium one in the future since it offers more space. 2. The service is fantastic! Sean and Zeev, the duty managers are excellent! Very friendly, helpful and accommodating. From the day when we made the booking with them (we booked through their website), the response is always quick. They really made a difference and made sure our stay in London is a memorable one. Our flight to London landed at 5 am so we reached the hotel by 8 am and they allowed us to check in with no questions asked. Similarly, our flights home is at 10 pm and they allowed us to check out at 4 pm. In fact they told us to stay as long as we like. Since we had to travel around Europe, we asked whether they could help us store our luggage for 3 days, and they said no problem, its free. They also upgraded us to triple room in our last 3 nights since they run out the premium room. 3. Location of the hotel is very central  about 5 minutes walk from Bayswater station on Circle Line. Although the hotel does not offer breakfast, there are a lot of eateries nearby. Our favourite is Nandos Portuguese Chicken around the corner and roast duck from Gold Mine Chinese restaurant. There are also few supermarkets and a mall nearby. Most of the time, we chose to buy food from Tesco or Marks &amp; Spencer and enjoyed our breakfast in our room. 4. For those who are very particular about cleanliness, the room is only cleaned once in seven days. It is no problem for us since we are relatively tidy and not in the hotel most of the time, but there is a big waste bin outside the hotel if you need throw rubbish that you dont want to keep overnight.Overall, we will definitely stay in Space Apart in the future. For the price they offer, you usually get a small cramped room in B&amp;B in London. Even serviced apartment in central London is not this cheap. So this is definitely a HIDDEN GEM!"
26,1162,"Oct 20 2008 	Loved the ultra modern Space Apart Hotel	The Space Apart Hotel consists of luxury ultra modern serviced apartments. The serviced apartments are brand new and I first checked into the property shortly after it opened. I am very fastidious about accommodation and a seasoned traveller. My standards are high and this property delivered in spades. The Space Apart Hotel is located in a quiet street in Bayswater/Notting Hill. The property is an 8 minute easy walk to Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace and a 12 minute walk to Kensington High Street. Absolutely everything is close at hand. It is a 4 minute walk to a Marks and Spencer and a Tesco Metro and a Waitrose. It is a 4 minute easy stroll to Bayswater station [District and Circle lines] and an 8 minute walk to Queensway station which is the Central line in case you want to get to Oxford Street. In addition there are numerous great eating options a few minutes walk away. The location of this property just can't be beaten whether you are a business traveller or a tourist. I booked a standard studio - this is just perfect for one person. The room had a double bed and 2 people could stay in the room but the hotel has much larger studios available for couples who want more space, and for families. The room was ultra modern and the finishes were contemporary and luxurious. The room contained plentiful storage, an ultra modern bathroom and a deluxe kitchen including a Bosch dishwasher, a Bosch cooktop, a Bosch microwave and a fridge/freezer. The room came equipped with all necessary crockery, cutlery and cooking utensils e.g. stainless steel kettle and toaster. The apartment also contained a washer/dryer so you can do your own laundry. There was also a Sony flatscreen tv in the apartment and even an IPOD dock. I felt this property offered good value for money by London standards and is much cheaper than staying in a hotel. It also has the benefit of you being able to do your own cooking and therefore saving money that way as well. The room came with electronically controlled ducted reverse cycle air conditioning to ensure comfort on both hot and cold days which I appreciated. The room had modern wooden flooring and halogen downlights and has been interior designed to the highest standard.I found the staff at the Space Apartment Hotel to be very helpful and friendly - Klaus and Sean are always friendly and happy to assist. The only thing that could do with improving at the Hotel is that they need to increase the selection of tv channels on offer e.g. put in Sky Sports or Setanta so that guests can watch the Premier League and Champions league football matches. Also the History or Biography channel wouldn't go amiss as well. I ended up staying at the Space Apart Hotel for many weeks and was incredibly happy. Quite frankly this standard of accommodation is very hard to find in London and this place is perfect for both long stay business travellers or shorter term tourists. I highly recommend this property."

1,1179,An oasis in a busy city	A great getaway surrounded by the hussle and bussleGreat ideaVery romantic
2,1179,"Sep 8 2008 	Nice Hotel	Stayed at this hotel on a 1 night trip to London. Upon arrival we were told to take a seat in reception area and we would be able to check in shortly. 45 minutes later we had still not checked in! Staff were very slow and very unconcerned that we were waiting. In the end we left our bags in the secure area and headed into the city as we did not want to waste any more time of our short break! The location is quite a way out of the centre of London but is easily accesible by the DLR and the tube. Upon returning to the hotel later that night, we were able to check in quickly and go to our room. The room was a very good size and very clean and comfortable with a nice clean bathroom. Next morning breakfast was taken over looking the Thames. Overall a good hotel, dispite the problems with the slow check in we enjoyed our stay here."
3,1179,Aug 5 2008 	Smelly Bathroom !	Hard to find when the motor show is on as the car-park is closed off in front of the yacht and you have to park in a ncp car park 15.00p per day.Staff never seen any only on check- in.Room was ok but the bathroom had a bad smell maybe its because of the venue.Good location for excel but i would not stay again.Its a one off to find out what its like but it costs a lot.
4,1179,"Jul 28 2008 	Just got back from great week-end	Great Location and easy parking for a weekend break away that I had arranged for my husband's birthday.We have just visited the Car show at the Excel and the yacht is a stones throw away from the venue. Overall opinion of the yacht-clean, service and staff very polite- dinner menu alittle pricey we ate in the bar area which was more affordable and had a good menu, drinks not too expensive, I was alittle put out that a suite which cost us 170.00 for one night had two single beds pushed to gether but as we were only staying one night I didnt really feel the need to complain, the weather was so fantastic it was like staying on a yacht in the Carribean(if only lol)Try it I think it's a lovely way to spend a night away."
5,1179,"Jun 26 2008 	Away From It All - Relaxing	I stayed here with my boyfriend and thought it was lovely, the rooms were very big and had a curtain to divide up the bed from the sofa area. The big mirror in front of the bed was also a plus and the decor and whole room in general was luxurious. The window was overlooking the sea and was a nice view.  However there is abosultely nothing to do around here so i would suggest entertaining yourselves. Its nice sitting and relaxing on the deck and the piano bar is also nice to sit in. It was a different and unique hotel/yacht and is definitely worth trying out. The big downside is the location as it is very secluded but it is also the price. It is expensive to stay here and as there was nowhere else to eat my boyfriend suggested we eat at the restaurant provided by the hotel. This was the biggest joke as it was extremely expensive with minute meals it was a waste of money as we were still hungry, and all the meals we had ordered were tiny portions and not filling. The bar is also expensive so in general the value for money is poor and the location is also poor.  However it is definitely worth experiencing for one night."
6,1179,"Jun 18 2008 	its OK. Worth a visit if going to Excel	I booked a room with a balcony, and had a nice view overlooking the carpark!! lovely!! There is not much near the hotel so i would only really recommend this hotel if you are going to the O2 or Excel. I would not make a special trip!Plus points - Clean, spacious room. minibar well stocked and not too expensive and the bed and sofa were extremely comfortable. Shower was nice and powerful. bad points. Needs a bit of TLC. Fake cold rimming is peeling off in the bathroom and the plastic bathroom is a bit of a let down. The hotel smelt a little of stagnant water, but that is to be expected bearing in mind where it is!! basically, good bet if you have to be in that area, but it is not somewhere i would make a special trip to, and it is not as plush as it should be for the price!!"
7,1179,Jun 8 2008 	cracking place to stay after a dodgy start	Just been to London for the weekend and were delighted to find the Sunborn. Having read the reviews we arrived with some trepidation. We had a dodgy first night with a high pitched sound emitting from the air conditioning but had complementary breakfast the next day. We were moved to an executive room the next day at no extra charge and had two brilliant days here. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and getting into London on the DLR/ thames clipper from O2 was easy and enjoyable. Recommend this highly and we'll stay here again if possible.
8,1179,"May 8 2008 	Very unusual and unique	We stayed on the yacht whilst seeing a show at the 02 Arena.The hotel is conveniently located just a few tube stops away from the Arena so this was a bonus.The hotel check in was efficient but not overly friendly and they insisted on taking a deposit for the room of 50 which if paid via a card was not returnable for 5 working days after check out,but returned on check out if paid in cash.The room was really large and was very clean and all bed linen and towels had an amazing,fresh soap powder smell..really nice...Iron and board in room already.European plug sockets as well as UK sockets avaliable.In room safe.TV reception a little poor and kept cutting out.Minibar....which I used to put my own beverages in to keep cool.Overall the hotel was a great experience but I felt the attitude of the staff although professional was a little snooty,and in my opinion let it down."
9,1179,"Apr 20 2008 	nice view of the car park	Maybe it is my fault, but when I heard about this unusual hotel I just expected every room to be overlooking the river. Unfortunately only half the rooms can see the river, the other half being handy to keep a watchful eye on your car. On realising this we mentioned it to reception, who very kindly checked to see if they could move us, they couldn't, but by way of compensation they gave us a free breakfast in our room. I don't think that the difference of car park/river view is highlighted on their web site, and when we suggested that it might be a good idea if it was, we were given a sympathetic look that may as well have said 'and that would be good for business would it?'. But they did seem to take note when we pointed out that their web site offers 'smoking room on request', but that the boat does not. Smoking is allowed on the balcony of our room however. As it is also allowed on the deck outside the bar, but lack of heaters, and a too high, too narrow rain shelter means smoking, or indeed drinking outside is a joyless experience. So drink inside you say. Well, as long as you can stand the yellow, dotty, plastic piping, strip lights that cling to every one of the bar rooms many pillars, and seem to flicker in the corner of your eye as you pass by, that is.The staff though were very helpful, booking cheap reliable mini cabs for us.Our room was good and clean, but the full length, 6 feet wide mirror opposite the bed was a bit, shall we say, unnerving. But once I'd checked as best I could for any signs of it being a two way mirror I had a good sleep. There wasn't any undue noise from the reasonably empty car park.Overall the hotel and staff was good, but not having a river view kind of defeated the whole point of going to this gimmick."
10,1179,"Apr 11 2008 	Off beaten track gem	Wasn't sure what to expect having stayed at a rather dingy Travelodge the night before and with the rate at the yacht hotel only 10 dearer. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. Check in was fast, efficient and friendly and with parking directly opposite only 10, very convenient.The room was on the 1st floor, i.e. bottom of the boat, with a large oval (non-opening) porthole that looked out over the water. The room was impressively large with a good king sized bed that I found very comfortable. The room was authentically decorated i.e. wooden panels and mirrors (which made the room seem even larger) and although the bathroom only sported a shower, it was nice and offered everything I needed for a night's stay (including fantastic water pressure and lovely hot water, which isn't always the case at hotels).I stayed with my 2 yr old daughter and she loved it - enough room to run about and great views of the water to watch the planes from city airport (which you could hardly hear at all and provide more of a spectacle than anything else) and the ducks (very important for a 2 yr old).The only thing I could fault this hotel for was the food. It was distinctly below average and definitely not up to the standard of what is an unusual but rather lovely hotel experience. I ordered room service which was efficient and prompt, but ended up leaving half of the (expensive) order. If staying here I'd recommend eating at one of the local hotels for your main meal (I didn't eat breakfast so can't comment) and then return to the yacht for drinks upstairs before retiring to your room.Definitely recommended and I will absolutely be looking to come here again, even though I live locally - it was an experience worth repeating."
11,1179,"Apr 11 2008 	the yacht in the dock	my partner and i have just returned from seeing the eagles in london O2. we stayed at the sunborn on our 2nd and 3rd nights. it is quite a place. we travelled by train so used the underground and the docklands light railway to get thereit took about 30mins from kings cross, it is next to the excel exhibition centre with the station being only 100yds away, but there is loads of parking if going by car. we stayed in a deluxe room with balcony. the bed was massive. it had a large shower, (no bath bit of dissapointment to me i like a bath). it had all the things you would expect mini bar, internet access tv etc. we stopped room only, we did not have breakfast as we thought it was rather excessive at 13-50 each. we had one problem. on the 1st night there was party on board, which led to a lot of noise from the party guests, the staff did try to to keep a lid on the noise to there credit, but without much success. so we did not get to sleep until 3-30am. on leaving we did mention this, and the guy on the reception had been on duty on the night so new what had gone on, he contacted the duty manager, with out prompting, and to our surprise we had 30 knocked off the bill, and were offered a free breakfast each. apart from that incident i would recommend the hotel it was very good."
12,1179,"Apr 4 2008 	Excellent Fun	I stayed here for two nights while at Excel, and found it to be great fun, the yacht itself is permanently moored to the key so does not move to much in the night. The bedroom for the money was very nice and clean and had a separate lounge area away from the bed.The bathroom could have done with a bit of work and does look and feel a bit old, but again was clean and all worked well, it even had a hand shower which is great for washing hair in the morning.My only disappointments with the room were the curtains did not meet in the middle when drawn and the aircon was on permanently and had no means of turning it off, and the fan was noisy all night.The bar area was pleasant and staff friendly the restaurant was clean and the food was very good, yes the service at times was slow and the excuse was they only had two chefs on that night, but it really did not impact on the whole experience.Yes the lift is a bit quirky as the exit is on a half floor, the first time you use it can be confusing, car parking was very easy as it was opposite the yacht, the directions on the website to the yacht could be better.I would definitely stay here again it was a great experience, and totally different to the regular chain hotels, more hotels should offer something a bit unique."
13,1179,"Apr 3 2008 	Most comfortable bed ever	Just spent 3 nights at the Sunborn the rooms are very spacious and well equipped but slightly hot! The yacht is so beautiful a bit of a trip into london but on the DLR it means you get to see some of london other than the inside of the underground, parking a bargain at 10 highly recommended will be going back"
14,1179,"Mar 31 2008 	Unusual but Good Choice for London	Just returned from a weekend break at the Sunborn and was pleasantly suprised. This is a purpose built yacht that is permanently moored at Docklands. It really has a feeling of a true yacht, with self closing doors and art deco hallways. Our room was very spacious with a view out to the water. Although close to City airport we didn't notice much noise. The hotel staff were efficient enough and housekeeping were discrete and thorough.No bath but a nice sized shower was sufficient for our purposes.The hotel is a five minute walk to the Docklands Light Railway, which in turn is about a 20 minute trip into London (Tower Gateway or Bank).This is a perfect hotel if you are visiting the Excel and a decent place for visiting London if you don't mind the journey in to town. A little different, a little quirky but definately memorable."
15,1179,"Mar 16 2008 	Cruising on Sunborn is good!	I had a room on the lowest deck, in the very bows of the ship. It was better than I was expecting. The room was larger than expected - a good size, large bed. The bed comfort was fine. It was quite quiet - a good thing when staying on the ship for 5 nights. The decor is a bit 1980's - nothing too bad, but just showing signs of a different time.Bar is on level 3 behind reception - good bar. Restaurant on level 5, I only had breakfast and that was all good.Location for ExCel exhibition Centre is outstanding - a few short steps from the East entrance.Overall, different, and good for London."
16,1179,"Mar 1 2008 	Quirky Shabby-chic!	I booked this hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, as we were going to a gig at the O2 Arena nearby, and we love to stay in unusual places - we love the old orient express train at Petworth Station, and Malmaison Oxford (Oxford Castle, and formerly a prison).I think at 109 it was great value for a large executive room with a balcony. I really like the tacky glamour of the decor, that has obviously seen better days - very shabby-chic!Having read other reviews, I avoided eating at the hotel, but did order champagne and strawberries on room service, and I have no complaints. Staff were friendly and helpful, and gave us a map and marked our tube journey for us.The tube journey to the arena was quick and straightforward, and the hotel bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get up the next day!"
17,1179,"Feb 25 2008 	I was tired the yacht was even tireder	Stayed for 2 nights while attending a seminar at Excel. No shaving socket in the bathroom which was annoying as I had travelled with an electric shaver and toothbrush. Hand held shower under the sink leaked leaving a constant puddle of water on the floor, it scored one point for being a reasonably sized room, but the decor was very tired and dated. Room service was mediocre - sirloin steak didn't come from a sirloin, coriander rice had no coriander! Breakfasts are terrible, avoid the &quot;full english&quot; it sits under hot lamps for a long time. The continental style buffet has cheap, dry bread rolls supplied by a frozen food company, along with the buffet size danish pastries, the sliced fuit (what there is) had been prepared the night before (trust me - I'm a chef!,I know this stuff), service is hit and miss, I had to get up and serve myself coffee! The dining area is tatty and the windows need cleaning if they want guests to enjoy the view, otherwise you can watch the reception staff coming in and helping themselves to food - don't they have a staff eating area?. The music system on the window ledge playing Julio Iglesias' back collection of greatest hits is dated and loud, avoid the tables near it, you won't be able to hold a conversation. The entrance is poorly laid out, the only way in and out is by lift, so you have to wait and enjoy the smell from the smokers in &quot;Marlboro Country&quot; by the entrance(one lift broke down while we were there). Overall the place feels and looks dated and tired,more &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot; than executive yacht! the only plus I could find, was it is right next to the venue. There are, I feel, better hotels the other side of Excel"
18,1179,"Jan 27 2008 	Off the Beaten Path but a Good Stay for the Price	I stayed at the Sunborn, twice in the month of November 2007. The novelty of the boat was cool. Additionally, the room was clean and very spacious (in comparison to most mid-priced rooms that I have stayed in, in London) and the front desk staff was very personable and acccommodating.Having read several reviews of the Sunborn here before I booked, I did not eat at the hotel at all, so I cannot attest to the quality of the food there. The only issue was the hotel's distance away from the city centre. It was pretty far removed, yet I was able to navigate pretty easlity without a car, because the hotel is right next the Excel Center, which is on an accesible rail line. Notably the subway directions that I got at the station, got me much closer to the hotel than those that the hotel gives, so it was just a matterof crossing the street and walking across a parking lot to get to the hotel.I would definately stay there again, although I would consider staying at a more central hotel, if the price was right."
19,1179,"Jan 10 2008 	Not the best choice	If you really need a place to stay, then you can crash here. But be aware that - in my room at least - there was no functioning warm water. Further, though the hotel promises LAN adapters available in the room. Even after requesting such an adapter several times it has not been delivered.Staff is extremely bearish and arrogant. As a guest you get the impression to bug the staff anytime and everywhere.Don't want to write in detail about the quality of the room service, ordered a club sandwich...don't do it!The location next to the City Airport is ok if you don't need to go to the city center. Rooms are ok, quite large and equipment is ok."
20,1179,"Dec 1 2007 	Enjoyable Stay	Myself and friend stayed at the Sunborn Yacht hotel as we were going to the O2 arena for a concert.We found the hotel very easy as the hotel website directions very very good.The hotel was very clean and the room very large and comfortable.The staff were very friendly and helpful.The hotel is a a bit too far from the O2, (I booked through another booking web site, not thier own), but next door to anyone visisting the Excel centre, and very handy for the city Airport."
21,1179,"Nov 20 2007	Bad experience	During an expo my company made room reservation an year (!!) in advance and pre-paid them!! Upon arrival at 7 pm that night they told me they were overbooked and could not offer me a room anymore, and my colleague even confirmed my arrival half hour earlier. They booked me in another hotel, 45 minutes away, they arranged a taxi. But this is really bad service !"
22,1179,Oct 11 2007	A little bit of different with a great feel	I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of June and I had absolutley no complaints and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The entrance is lovely with a winding staircase up to the restaurant and terrace area - breakfast was good and glad had b&amp;b - and the staff were very helpful and attentive. There are newspapers available in the lobby area and there was access to the internet available. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Small seating area with coffee table to watch tv and a mini bar in the room - not too extortionate but reasonably pricey. I had a balcony room and this was lovely to stand out on and watch the dingy sailing on Sunday morning. The location was great for me and I found it easy to get in and out of London. Watch the last train times but I used a taxi to get back one night and the hotel recommended a good firm and the price was very reasonable. Close to the O2 arena for concerts and easy to get to by car. Would definately recommend and maybe the other recent writer caught the restaurant on a bad day as my breakfast both mornings was very good.
23,1179,"Aug 30 2007 	just a bit different	they are still developing the area but you can easily access central london on the LDR which is 2 mins away, the yacht itself is beautiful, rooms are extremely spacious and well equipped and if you get a room with a balcony overlooking the water on a sunny day (as we did) the views are lovely."
24,1179,"Aug 2 2007 	Just hed to tell you about this hotel	If you dont mind being in Docklands and right beside Excel then STAY HERE!Its about 20 minutes into central London but if you dont mind that then please please stay here. Yes, its a boat, about 4 minutes walk from the DLR Prince Regent stop, across the Exel car park. No problems with the area. However, if you have bags with you, just be aware of the walk. Enter into a small lift which takes you up to reception. The FRIENDLIEST reception staff ever. Lovely check in, fast, plus upgrade in the very swish reception area with spiral staircase and dark woods. Very &quot;movie set&quot;. Special feel already. The cabin was beautiful. Not that wide but very long with a dark wood exclusive feel to it. Small wardrobe, drawers, great bed, area to put your bag in, seating area with leather settee and then your balcony. Small balcony but lovely to stand outside and look at everying on the river apart from the rowers I accidentally flashed at! Although the space isnt huge, it feels like you have a lot of room and they have really cleverly organised the space. You also have minibar and kettle and coffee etc. There is enough room to work in the room on the coffee table although you dont have a desk. Wifi is available in the public areas and I did manage to tap into it in my room. Although on business, a lovely experience. Please bear in mind - THIS IS A BOAT. So, there are some boat noises, a bit of clanging etc occasionally but no problem unless you focus on things like that. Bathroom small but no smaller than other central London hotels and a lot cleaner!Very pleased, will stay again as soon as possible and look at the rates - forget the other hotels and silly rates, have a bit of luxury."
25,1179,"Aug 1 2007 	Worst meal I've ever had	I booked the Sunborne Yacht Hotel via Late Rooms therefore receiving a substantial discount on the room rate. The description said that parking outside the hotel was available at a cost of 10. Arrived quite late and the carpark directly outside was totally empty but for some reason was not allowed to park in it and was asked to park some way away on a derelict piece of waste ground. Mine was the only car there, no lights or security cameras. Complained that evening, no result. Still got charged 10 as according to the hotel they have use of the Excel parking facilities and have to charge guests to park anywhere within the vacinity.Went to the bar for a light evening meal and ordered pasta with smoked mackerel in a cream and dill sauce. What arrived was absolutely disgusting - soggy pasta, a scraping of slimey mackerel, dried dill all in a tasteless white sauce. I was too tired to complain again so left meal and went to bed. Next morning I really didn't want to try any more of their food so checked out and went to Macdonalds, which I hate but I have to say the bacon macmuffin was highly superior than the meal I'd received the night before at the hotel.Very poor front of house service, limited signage throughout the hotel so difficult to find way way around."
26,1179,Jul 25 2007 	Great stay	We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht hoyel for 3 nights in July and had great time. The rooms were clean and spacious and it is one of the only hotels we have stayed in that had a proper sofa rather than the bed for watching TV. The rooms were very sound proofed as the Hotel is in the city of London airport flight path and we didn't hear any planes. The hotel is a short walk to prince regent DLR station and takes approx. 20 mins to Tower gateway station. The only downside to the hotel is that if you would like to eat in the restaurant as it is expensive this includes breakfast at 13.50. So if you are going to book make sure you get a deal with Breakfast included. We booked with Superbreak and found they were the most reasonable and included Breakfast.
27,1179,"Jun 9 2007 	Clean novel and good value for money	I stayed here for a brief overnight as I had an early flight from London City Airport. I booked through the airport's website and got a very good deal - 69 for a sinlge person for the night. The location is very convenient for City Airport and for the Excel conference centre which is literally right next to the hotel. It was easy to get there via the DLR - you can see the yacht from the station, though be prepared for going up and down a lot of steps to get there from the platform. It is also near the Millenium Dome (as was).It actually is a yacht, which gives the hotel novelty value. Inside is plush, clean and modern. Despite being on water, I didn't feel any movement, so the seasick need not fear. My room had a nice view over the Thames - there's not much attractive on the opposite bank, but the river itself looked pretty. Staff on the desk were friendly and helpful. The reception is open 24 hours which is good for early departures to catch flights. I didn't use the bar or restaurant so can't comment. The room was very big and spotlessly clean. There were big mirrors all along one wall and a window with a view of the river. There was a sofa and coffee table, lots of wardrobe space, a big TV and an en suite with a shower. It was very good value for money, clean, sparkly and modern. A good place to stay, especially if you are using the Excel centre or London City Airport."
28,1179,"May 27 2007 	Excellent and a novel place to stay.	I booked this hotel for myself and partner as I was going out to a work function in London on a Monday evening. I tried a more central location, but prices were ridiculous at short notice, and the Sunborn Yacht was very reasonably priced in comparison. Its a bit of a trek out of London, though I'm not sure its 45 minutes, and the DLR is certainly not 10 minutes away. The Excel centre has a few bars and cafe's, and is a short walk. Canary Wharf is 10 minutes down the DLR, and has plenty of bars, restaurants, and shops.The yacht itself is an excellent hotel, I didn't book anything special, we got a room on a lower deck, overlooking the Wharf, the room was huge for London, and extrememly comfortable. We didn't eat in the hotel but did enjoy a coffee before we left. The staff were very friendly, and the whole place looked well looked after."
29,1179,"May 24 2007 	Great location for excel	I stayed on the yacht whilst at a event at the adjacent Excel centre , what a joy just having a two minute walk in the morning as opposed to the pain of having to travel out from central London.I arrived mid morning but the reception staff were really helpfull and let me have my room early .Throughout my stay all the staff were really friendly and helpfull . We didnt eat on the yacht but the menu looked Ok however there is so many good restaurants / bars just a short taxi ride or on the DLR its probably a shame not to go out .Ive seen some great offers for the yacht on late rooms etc for when there isnt any events on at Excel so I would defintley recomend it for a short break , just remember you will not be in central London ."
30,1179,"May 7 2007 	Sunbourne Yaght Hotel - Fantastic!	We booked this Hotel for the weekend through a popular website.Wasnt sure what to expect - as we booked The Sunbourne Yaght in favour of The Premier Travel Lodge as it was slightly cheaper!!Docked along side the London Excell and a convienent two minute walk to the Docklands Light Railway. (DLR)The hotel was very cheap - and surpriseingly good! Great looking boat. Entrance could do with updating, but once onboard the reception area iself is really nice. Lovely big spiral stair case. Our room was very well decorated, HUGE comfy bed. Separate living area with sofa table and chair. Well stocked mini bar which wasn't too badly priced...Glass doors opening out onto a small balcony.Quality Complimentry magasines.A curtain divided the room - so the sofa could be folded out as a bed, which was also very comfortable, and would be great for anyone wanting to stay cheaply with children.Good range of entertainment, sky tv, internet, movies and a games console in the room.Great shower - very blasty! Nice - though smallish bathroom. All staff we met were friendly and helpfull.Really nice to sit out on on deck either last thing at night or the first thing in the morning. Obstructed views of both the dome and Canary Wharfe.Excellant value for money. Rather unique - and would definatly recomend.The only dissapointing thing being the view of the car park on one side of the boat!"
31,1179,"Apr 24 2007 	Good standard of accommodation in Docklands	I stayed for 2 nights at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel whilst attending a conference at the adjacent ExCel Conference Centre.The hotel (a custom built yacht hotel) is moored in Royal Victoria Dock and is adjacent to the ExCel Conference Centre, 4 minutes taxi ride from City Airport, and 3 minutes walk from Docklands Light Railway. The rooms are large and well furnished with a separate living area with TV, mini bar, safe, trouser press etc. The public areas were of a good standard and were well maintained.The staff were friendly and efficient, breakfast was a good hot and cold buffet, and food and drinks in the bar were good. I didn't eat in the restaurant, other than for breakfast, but the prices on the dinner menu seemed a little high. The hotel didn't have any leisure facilities for the general use of guests.I would recommend this hotel for anyone attending a conference in Docklands, providing reduced rates apply, as the standard tariff's are quite expensive."
32,1179,"Apr 20 2007 	Okay but not for business trips.	The Sunborn Yacht Hotel was booked for me by my company for it's close proximity to London City Airport. I have to say it's okay, there's nothing wrong with it as such, but it's just not great!Check in was great and the staff member was very friendly, but then the staff went downhill. I tried to get a cable for internet access and the attitude of the guy at the desk was terrible. Just come out to the lobby and use the free wireless was his attitude. Great, but I needed to be on a web conference and I didn't want the background noice of the lobby or others listening to the meeting. If it was just some general advice that there's free access in the lobby, that would have been fine, but the fact he kept insisting I use the wireless seemed to me that he just couldn't be bothered going through the paperwork. (Note there was no wireless access from the room, well there was a very low signal, and I was on the same floor as the lobby).The restautrant staff weren't much better. The first thing they did when I arrived was complained to me that I hadn't reserved, even though the restaurant was emptly. Seeminly the chef was busy catering for a party downstairs and didn't have time to cook me a meal. I said I'd be happy to wait and read my book but in the end the speed of service was fine, so why they felt the need to go on about not booking beats me.I'd say it's a good hotel if you're looking for a quiet break as it does seem to be very quiet even though it's next to ExCel. the room was clean and the shower was powerful, but not too warm. The curtains are paper thin!"
33,1179,"Apr 19 2007 	Interesting Change	Stayed here in March for 2 nights wanted to book something a bit different. The Friday night had a 'showcase' night on with lots of singers followed by a disco. No charge for this, worth calling the hotel to check when the next one is on. The trains are frequent and you feel a world away from the hustle and bustle. Rooms were large and service was great. Would recommend someone who wants a change and doesnt mind a 30 minute ride into the city."
34,1179,"Apr 10 2007	It's not a proper boat!!	to be honest I wasn't that enamoured with the reception and facilities at this hotel. the staff were pretty short and their customer service skills weren't great. the room was OK, but i certainly wouldnt pay the full rate for it and the food was ridiculously overpriced. The hotel is near to a station which is a good point i guess, but if you're planning to stay at this hotel because you like ships or cruising then you might be disappointed as the resemblance to a real working ship was pretty shallow and didnt stretch much beyond a few decorative life buoys. Anyway, enough [--------------]. if you do chose to stay here then have a good one...and mind the gap in the 'double bed'!"
35,1179,"Apr 8 2007 	Excellent Hotel	Just returned from our second stay at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel, we previously stayed in December 2005 so we knew what to expect and were not disappointed. Although the hotel is situated in Docklands it is quite easy to reach the City and sights using the DLR. The hotel is excellent with spacious, well maintained bedrooms and this time we had a balcony which is an added bonus. The hotel has a great ambience and the staff are friendly and efficient. Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of options to choose from. All in all we think this hotel offers great value for money in a setting which is different from usual. Perhaps not the choice for families with young children but a fantastic hotel for couples. We will certainly stay on the yacht again."
36,1179,"Apr 5 2007 	Nice quiet very comfortable...shame about the location	Arriving by train, the view from the station is daunting. The yacht is across a very large car park belonging to the Excel Exhibition Centre. (Trains are very regular, but the lifts were out of order and if you've got a big case or two and a dicky heart, this could well cause issues - it did for me!)Once in the hotel, things were great. The room was clean and large. The staff were efficient and, in the bar at least, friendly. We checked out the restaurant, but didn't eat there as no one else was and we like a little atmosphere to a meal. The bar was nice and, best of all there was no piped music...worth the stay on its own!! The bar food is ok, but over-priced and, unlike almost every other part of London, there are no small eating places close by.However, the lack of neighbours means that its very peaceful and you don't get woken up early in the morning through traffic. breakfast was good. Its buffet style and I'm not a fan of cooked meals buffet style, so stuck with the continental. Healthy and fresh.As you're on a yacht, everything is close by. No great long corridors to pass through on your way to you very comfortable bed. Overall, a good place to stay if you want a quiet time and are happy to travel in and out of the city by light train/tube (easy changes and regular trains) and we'd happliy stay there again as long as we could get a deal (we had 3 nights for two and a discount). Its certainly not 5* and probably just about scrapes a 4*. Given its location, a health spa would be helpful for added relaxation. However, get a good deal and its a nice place to be. (NOT a place to take the kids. They'd drive you crazy for things to do!!)"
37,1179,"Mar 28 2007 	An interesting change	Out of curiosity (being frequent cruise ship passengers), we stayed here for two nights over a weekend to try it out, while still being in London so that we weren't really &quot;away&quot;.The room and bathroom were surprisingly large, and compared favourably to some other shoreside London hotel rooms that we've seen. However, they gave the impression of being rather sparsely equipped. Nothing was missing, but there just seemed to be acres of blank space on desks, shelves, etc. The bathroom was very warm throughout the weekend, and we couldn't find any way of turning off what we presumed was underfloor heating. But otherwise, the room and bathroom were in good order and comfortable.There are few facilities onboard - fundamentally, an inside bar on deck three and a restaurant on deck five with an outside bar area. So in many ways we're glad that we ended up having relatively little time to spend at the hotel. The inside bar seemed quite pleasant, though, and we will bear it in mind for future times when we're in the area.The breakfast was pretty good, by hotel breakfast buffet standards, although the tea was a rather hit-and-miss affair depending on whether a cup was poured from a circulating pot, or whether a teapot was left with us (and, in that case, how long the teabag had been in the water).The only real problem was that on the first night, a private party was taking place on the top deck including a loud disco. The noise from this penetrated into our room and was rather intrusive. With that much sound penetration, it should not have been allowed to go on until 2 am. It was a relief not to have that the second night.And charging 10 a day for car parking was, I thought, rather steep considering the nature of the parking - part of the visitors' car park for the ExCeL exhibition centre - and the (lack of) demand for it at the times when most guests would be parking for longest, ie overnight.Finally, this is a great hotel for planespotters. The flight path for London City Airport is almost directly overhead, and landing aircraft are at a height of only about 150 feet. The airport itself is also within view of the hotel. So this could be quite an interesting place to stay for an enthusiast."
38,1179,"Mar 26 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	We stayed 2 nights at this hotel in March - we thought it was great. The hotel is a custom built yacht in Royal Victoria Dock, not far from Canary Wharf and right next to the ExCel Exhibition Centre. It is a bit out of the way for central London and the West End - it took us about 20 minutes on the Docklands Light Railway from Tower Embankment, but trains are frequent.We booked the hotel last minute through a website called ratestogo and got a much better deal than we would have directly with the hotel. We paid 90.00 per night for 2 of us and our 3 year old son. Breakfast was extra - 13.50 per person - our son was free of charge.The hotel is very close to the City Airport. We were a bit concerned about this as the planes taking off and landing were very close to our balcony. In the room however the noise was not a problem and there is no plane activity between about 9 pm and 7:30 am.The hotel has 102 yacht suites and 2 luxury suites. The rooms are air-conditioned and have network connections. Check-in was efficient and we were pleased with our room. It was on the second floor with a balcony overlooking the water. One side of the yacht overlooks the car-park - obviously not ideal so do ask for a water view. From our balcony you could see Canary Wharf in the distance and the top of the Thames barrier.The room was very spacious - one of the biggest I've ever had in London. It had a huge double bed and a big sofa bed. There was a mini-bar, hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities and a trouser press. The bathroom was smallish but very modern with a power shower.We loved the novelty of staying in a yacht in Docklands. Also being that bit further out of the centre of London, you get more &quot;room&quot; for your money. The slight drawback is the longer journey in and out of the centre.The hotel has a restaurant - we did not eat there as it seemed very pricey, also it did not seem to have much atmosphere. We ate out in a great Carribean restaurant about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Go past the ExCel exhibition centre, walk along the waterfront and you can't miss it. It has a lovely interior, laid back and friendly atmosphere, great service and delicious food. Also the walk along the waterfront is very pleasant with the lights of Canary Wharf in the distance. We also felt very safe out walking in this area at night.I would recommend this hotel - it is good value for money for London - use the bargain websites to get a reduced rate, also it is a little bit different staying in a yacht. Just be aware it is not centrally located and if you want to sightsee or go out in the West End you will have a bit more travelling to do."
39,1179,"Mar 26 2007 	Ok for short-stay	We stayed only one night &amp; chose this hotel for its proximity to Excel center and the in-room broadband access inclusive rate (125 gbp). During our 3 week trip to London, we also stayed at the Sumner and Riverbank Park Plaza. The Park was the cheapest @ 69 GBP, wonderful location, with internet &amp; breakfast included, but internet was down for 3 days &amp; service was sloppy. The Sumner was the most expensive (199 GBP), but had the best service, reliable internet &amp; decent breakfast, included in rate. The Sunborn had reliable internet, ok service and the worst breakfast (not included in rate &amp; way expensive).Location: between Custom House (12 minutes) &amp; Prince Regent (5 min) tubes. If you have luggage, get off at Prince Regent so you only have to walk across a small parking lot. From LHR T4, we took the Picadilly line to Green Park and transferred to Jubilee Line and then onto the DLR line to get to our final stop, Prince Regent. Do not attempt this with bulky luggage, as we did. We were lucky our flight arrived on a Friday 7am and by the time we got thru immigration, it was after the morning commute rush. Tubes were relatively uncrowded and we had space for luggage.Check-in: went smooth, nothing to complain about or compliment. I would rate the hotel, furnishings, service, ambiance and rooms at 3-star. Room: very spacious, traditionally appointed in the usual poly-blend materials. Room had nice wood floors and a port-hole window that looked out onto the water. View was nothing to admire- old Mill building across the way, high way ramps further off. During the London Boat show we were able to watch the boat races, which was great as the boats came by very close to the 'yacht'. Heat was too high though and we had to turn it off for the night. Bed was not the greatest - springy, motel quality, with poly-cotton, thin sheets and blanket. But after our flight from Maui, this could not prevent us from sleep. We appreciated having the reliable high-speed Internet access, fax &amp; modem points and large working desk. Maybe we slept too deeply, but there were no discernible noises from the other rooms. It wasn't windy either and there were no functions in the hotel - so it was a quiet night during our stay.Bathroom: small, economical, very clean. Shower had suprisingly good water pressure. Breakfast: mediocre. They would not accomodate request for egg-whites only. Consisted: tea bag, canned beans, runny egg beaters, boiled mushrooms and supermarket pastries. Not terrible, but at 16 GBP/person, NOT worth it. Take the tube to the nearest Pret, instead.We are returning to London in April for the Guitar show and have booked the Sunborn again. Proximity to Excel &amp; in-room internet access is the reason, again. Ok, reallY it's because spouse loves the 'yacht' concept. I am sure the Ramada or Novotel or Travelodge would suffice for a short stay while visiting Excel, but I cannot comment on or compare those establishments."
40,1179,"Feb 26 2007 	Not all plain sailing!	Reception staff good and genuinely set a good example and standard, which was my first impression of the Hotel. Housekeeping...I would go so far as to say....excellent. Now that is rare for me. Nothing and I mean nothing was too much trouble, more teabags..coffee...pillows..towels...milk etc...little things that when you are away from home...just make your stay that much more comfortable...when these are provided to you in addition to what already has been placed in the room and all done quickly and with a smile and good attitude!..Shame then, that the catering side lets the Hotel down. We ate in the 5th floor restaurant...they were understaffed and the food was not reflective of the prices charged, if anything you could tell it was all pre prepared, they seemed to have a problem if you order your steak other than well done..I don't blame some Hotels for doing this but some, no doubt, are better than others at disguising this trait!...for my sins..I had breakfast in the restaurant the following morning...and the waitresses could'nt even serve a drinkable cup of tea...cooked breakfast I will leave to your imagination...even the cold buffet they could'nt get right. Training for chef , kitchen staff and waitresses and to also work as a team and to be just as proud of the restaurant as the housekeeping staff are of the rooms and reception staff are, of the Hotel and all will be okay."
41,1179,"Feb 23 2007 	Good but not a 5-star hotel	The room was big (comparing to other hotels in London) and the boothrom new and clean. Bargain room rate over the weekend. Check-in was rather a cool acceptance than a warm response. Never a 5-star hotel!Good location if you are there for business (Exel, Canary Wharf). In walking distance from London City Airport. Near a DLR station. Avoid to walk there in the evenings (-&gt; scallywags)."
42,1179,"Feb 19 2007 	Lovely hotel	Stayed here for valnetines weekend, Hotel is lovely as was the room. But if your not into the fancy food in the resturant your a bit buggered and there's nothing near and unless your driving and know your way around your fine otherwise probs best off ordering room service.I would stay here again but the management is not the best i've ever seen and am still trying to work out how the manager is appointed manager."
43,1179,"Jan 19 2007 	A good alternative to central london	I stayed here with my partner last August for 1 night. It is slightly out of the way of central London, i think this is a selling point for the hotel, its nice and relaxed this way. On arrival to the yacht i was shown to a &quot;car park view&quot; room...please please please make sure you dont get one of these rooms. I politly asked to be changed over to the other side and luckily enough, it was not a problem for the friendly staff. Rooms are very spacious, decor is a little tired but not terrible by any standards. Food in the restaurant is a la carte and pricey. I would recommend the carribbean scene restaurant which is a 10 minute stroll down the docks, with a lovely view of canary wharf. The noise from the airport is noticable in daylight, but quiet at night. The breakfast is absolutly lovely, its the best ive ever had in any hotel! The staff do watch you like hawks and seem to linger around you though, which irritates me. Altogether, we really enjoyed our stay, i would definatly stay here again."
44,1179,"Nov 17 2006 	Very Good but don't pay full price!	I have stayed here twice and this is a very nice 3 star hotel that also happens to be a yacht, staff are ok and both the bar and restaurant are spacious, comfortable and pleasant.A warning to those people using Sat Nav system to find it, it probably won't show up at all on your systems, instead point your Sat Nav at the centre of Prince Reagent street and then follow the signs for hotels.The rooms a nice, clean, quite large and decorated nicely and the beds are comfortable without being luxurious. I recommend being on the 3rd or 4th floor as the rooms are slightly larger, and the view better.I do think this hotel is massively overpriced at it's standard rate however, at the time of writing their standard rate is 205 for a single room! The good news is that if you shop around and book ahead you can find yourslef a double room (sleeping 2 people) for less than 90 almost any day of the month (excluding special holidays etc).So overall very nice indeed but if I had paid full price I would have had much higher expectations and felt it was just average. As it was I felt it was excellent value for money and very pleasant stay whether as a business traveller or with a partner."
45,1179,"Nov 8 2006 	Terrific stay at the Sunborn	Stayed at the Sunborn Yacht whilst attending the world travel market. We were absolutely delighted with our stay. Reception staff were lovely but efficient, the room (standard) was a lot larger than we thought it would be, great bed ...Fantastic shower. We eat in the restaurant both nights, one night with a client who was most impressed as he was staying at another hotel costing quite a lot more than we were paying. Back to food - lovely - could not fault it. We will certainly stay there again for any excel travel functions.Could not recommend for people wanting to do the west of london, but for excel attendees totally fab!"
46,1179,"Sep 3 2006 	Great hotel	Great place to stay with stunning rooms and great decor. Certainly a change to stay on a yacht, and the price is in line with other similar accommodation in London. Was handy for me as I had a group of friends visiting me in London, they all enjoyed it too. Highly recommended."
47,1179,"Aug 19 2006 	great expectations!	Just had wonderful 3 night stay at Sunborn yacht, courtesy of a &quot;[-------------]&quot; deal, as a 20th wedding anniversary celebration. We would probably not have selected this hotel at full price, but the deal of 99 each for 2 nights and 1 free was excellent. We chose to add a balcony supplement of 20 the room per night and received a wonderfully situated cabin 2/3 along on 3rd deck on the waterside. It was all magnificently private, and larger than expected, with the option of having balcony doors open just to sit in the lounge part of the cabin. Interest around the Docklands was enlightening, we felt the scenery was historic of the area and more interesting than a central London squatty dwelling with a view of next door's brick wall! City airport nearby added to this flavour, flights not disruptive at all after 10pm or before 8am. We would disagree with other reviews about the yacht being past it's sell by date and that Prince Regent DLR station was too far to walk! We parked our car literally just outside the front door of yacht entrance and picked it up on our departure, the walk to Prince Regent a stone's throw, with services to suit leaving central London after post-theatre supper, arriving back at 01.00h. The photos supplied by another review helped us to choose this hotel. Excel was quiet during our stay, we enjoyed exploring the area around on foot and discovered a wonderful restaurant called Caribbean Scene, further up the quay from the yacht in the direction of Canary Wharf only a few minutes walk from the yacht. Hotel restaurant a la carte is posted on the web so you know what you pay before you go, however we couldn't even manage desserts, so were well fed with our superbly tasting portions. Breakfasts were excellent. The whole culture of Canary Wharf was a new experience and very recommended, with excellent coffee houses and outdoor cafes. We reviewed everyone else's comments and did our research well, the reward being a superior sized London room at half the price and double the interest."
48,1179,Aug 11 2006 	Great stay on board yacht	We stayed at the Sunborn Yacht while visiting the Motorshow at the Excel centre in July. We couldn't have picked a more convenient place to stay as the yacht is moored alongside the conference centre. The yacht was very clean and the room surprisingly spacious and well furnished. The shower was very powerful and had nice accessories. The staff were very friendly and they stocked Amstel beer which was a great luxury for us! We would definitely recommend staying at this hotel and hope to stay again for the motorshow next time.
49,1179,"Aug 4 2006	Great Hotel	This is something different from the norm. All you would ask from a 4* Hotel but with the difference of it being a Yacht. I stayed in May this year with a friend and got a fabulous price on Superbreak. The room was lovely, with two very comfortable twin beds and then a living area beyond. We didn't have the luxury of a balcony or terrace as we were on the lower ground floor and dockside, I would recommend the other side of the yacht as we overlooked the car park rather than the dock itself. The bathroom had a great shower and very nice toiletries. Breakfast was worth getting up for and as you eat you can watch the planes flying over as they take off from the city airport which is just across the road, although the noise is minimal. The decor is beautiful and the staff very helpful. Docklands LIght Railway is a few minutes walk away across the car park and the lights on the Yacht are helpful and welcoming when you come back late at night. Would highly recommend. Only downside is the 20 minute ride back on the railway from the city centre, although to be fair the hotel is advertised as being in the Docklands."
50,1179,"Jul 24 2006	A Dream weddiing come true	I had my wedding at the sunborn hotel. It was magnificant. I hired the fifth deck and had the whol floor to myslef. I had the open deck laied with tables and chairs which the friendly staff placed for me.The fron deck they covered with glass just for me as prior to my wedding this was also an open deck. It consisted of a bar area which all my drinks were served by the staff. In the restaurant area it was exclusive to my wedding only. I had tables, chairs set and decorated with my wedding colour theme. I had cocktails on arrival and I remember how magical it felt going up the golden staircase whilst I was videoed.The staff there made my day so special and I was told that I was the first wedding they had done so for. I stayed on the fifth floor in a room which consisted of a sauna. I really had a great time and the food was cooked excellent."
51,1179,"Jun 7 2006 	Sloppy seconds after a few good years at sea...	I'm sure there was a time when this was THE place to be. However, that time was probably about 10 or 15 years ago and in the middle of the Mediterranean. Currently, the yacht/hotel is now washed up on the not-so-appealing London docklands and there's a certain smell to the rooms that makes it seem that they haven't been occupied since their peak a decade ago. Nonetheless, if the only reason you're going to London is to be at Excel, it is only about 50 feet from the entrance and across the Excel parking lot from the tube (Canning Town). Overall, it's a decent deal; I paid 107 pounds/night for a double room (excluding breakfast), but I wouldn't pay anymore than that and would stay somewhere closer to London if the purpose of the trip was touring the main attractions."
52,1179,"Jun 4 2006 	Best Value In London Today	As a refugee from the recent closure of the much loved Dolphin Square Hotel, Sunborne is a welcome, if very different alternative.This was my second stay and as usual the level of comfort and cleanliness was first class.Whilst the restaurant is not cheap 200 buys a good meal for two, the cuisine is absolutely superb.All in all a real Docklands gem. Thank you all!"
53,1179,"May 22 2006 	Yacht hotel gimmick not worth the money	The thought of staying on a yacht sounds luxurious, but the gimmick soon wears off after check-in. I stayed at this hotel because of its unbeatable proximity to the Excel conference center which was right next store. (Also, work was picking up the tab.)First, it is not a cruise ship (like it looks in the pictures). There are few amenities beyond the bar, modest restaurant and meeting rooms. No exercise room, hot tub or pool. This would be ok by me if I weren't spending 140 Pounds/night. To be fair, my room was spacious especially since I was expecting only a bottom line cruise ship cabin. This room was bigger than a typical Hilton room in the US, and definitely bigger than other hotel rooms I've had in Europe.I did not sleep well, though, because of this annoying groaning and creaking sounds from the gang plank attached to the yacht right outside my room. The sound was quite loud and seemed to resonate throughout, so I am sure I was not the only one affected. The sound got worse on the night the wind picked up causing the yacht to pitch more in the water. This was the biggest drawback in my opinion.Entering and exiting the hotel is difficult because the only way in or out is through these odd elevators in the center of the yacht which they said was a security feature. (I guess it met this objective.) The gang planks referred to earlier were emergency exits only. I also concur with the comments made by others regarding the walk from the rail station, so I won't elaborate.My room included breakfast which consisted of a traditional English Breakfast (a lot like the traditional American Breakfast) and a Continental breakfast bar. Coffee and tea are included. I found the food adequate for my needs, but definitely not luxurious like you might expect on a yacht (or a cruise ship).The crew (I mean staff) were helpful and accommodating and provided little extras (like a power adapter, iron and board, restaurant recommendations) when asked.This was my first time to London, so I don't have much to which to compare my stay. I just think one could do better for 140 Pounds/night plus tax, or pay less money for a hotel that sits on land instead of in the water."
54,1179,"May 16 2006	Great for something different	Traveled to London for a theatre show at the weekend, even though we arrived two hours before check in, nothing was too much trouble and we were quickly found rooms to change in.The rooms were excellent and for the cost, exceptional value for London.We travelled by cab to and from the West end ( around 25.00 each way) and chilled in the bar when back in the evening.Good range of breakfast on Sunday Morning ( served til late too ) and left at 12.00 feeling thoroughly satisfied.Will travel there again soon, thoroughly recommend it."
55,1179,"Apr 12 2006	Different and great value for London	We had a 3 night stay on the Sunborn Yacht from 25 March 06, and I cannot resist adding my own views and photos which may dispel some car park crossing/travelling myths.For 200 in total we had a spacious, spotless and very comfortable room with river view. Ok, not a great view with an old disused factory mill opposite, but this is London Docklands and not Green Park. The staff were polite, and yes the buffet breakfast was the same each day, but quite sufficient and acceptable, offering a choice of cereals, fruits, juices, breads, pastries, jams plus a hot counter and as much tea and coffee as you wanted.Accessible on the Docklands Light Railway, you can be from Prince Regent to Tower Bridge in 25 minutes maximum, and if travelling around London, the best option is the day ticket for 5.40 which allows 24 hour travel on the underground and the DLR. Make sure you have card/change for the machines each day.To get to the yacht from Prince Regent station, you do have to cross the Excel car parks and it takes about 5 minutes. Our experiences were very few cars in the car park, no one around, although a security guard was patrolling the area on two occasions as we crossed. After saying that, if travelling alone, I would not have felt comfortable or secure crossing by myself. I have attached photographs taken from the station and from the yacht, which might be helpful and reassuring that it isnt very far (it just feels that way if it's raining!).We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment, but we did order room service when we returned about 9pm, which was absolutely fine. Just over 20 for fish &amp; chips, and beef in ciabatta bread with chips and salad. They did add a 2 service charge themselves. Maybe a little pricy, but arent all London hotels the same?After reading some reviews regarding disco noise, maybe we were very fortunate that there were no parties that weekend, hence no disco noise. Maybe this was due to the time of year, but it may be worth checking it out with the hotel before booking. Airport noise was very minimal but not apparent during the night.Considering the quality, room size, cost and something a little different, it proved a good choice for us. Central London hotels cannot compare to this, except for being central. If it is your intention to visit attractions all day, and evening shows or entertainment, then be aware of the journey time, or pay a premium to stay in central London. Alternatively, plan to combine the two and make only one journey.Not sure?  do your research before booking.We spent our time sightseeing, enjoyed the whole stay, and would recommend staying at this hotel, but just be aware of the location. I would stay here again, great value for money."
56,1179,"Mar 30 2006	Worth the extra mile.	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 26/3/06. Having read the reviews and scrutinising several London hotels decided on this one as it seemed to be the best for our budget. I cannot understand people who have made comments on the distance from central london...this hotel is in Docklands NOT central london so yes, there is a 20 minute train journey to Tower hill, but I beleive that this hotel is worth the extra distance. The other reviewer who commented on a 10 minute walk across the car park has slightly over exaggarerated this, yes it is a bit of a pain if the weather is not nice but it takes 5 minutes at the most. My personal belief is that this hotel is on a par with any crown plaza, the rooms are very generous with a queen sized bed (very comfortable) and you have a seperate seating area with mini bar &amp; TV. The staff are very helpful and on our first night recommended the local thai resturant with whom they have an arrangement to transport you to and from, the food there was excellent. The only thing that let down our whole stay was on the last morning we were woken by the fire alarm, this was appalingly managed as there was no fire drill to speak of, we were all stood by the entrance there was nobody from the hotel checking that all the guests were out. And to top all of that the fire engine could not get through the barricades to the car park, eventually took 10 minutes at least to get in. But that aside this hotel is excellent, there is no noise to speak of from the nearby city airport overnight. And all in all I would definatly stay there again."
57,1179,"Mar 29 2006 	The best in London	We stayed here for one night only and how disappointed we were... not with the Sunborn you understand! But because we couldn't stay longer!The hotel certainly is great value for money. We stayed in a Luxury Room on Deck C with a view of the Thames. With breakfast it cost just 99.The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful.After check-in - the receptionists were very efficient - we had a drink and ordered a bite to eat from the bar menu. Although the food was a little pricey (8.50 for a burger and chips), it couldn't be faulted. It was just like the treatment you would expect on a cruise ship where absolutely nothing is too much of a problem. We sat, ordered, ate, drank, paid, sat etc etc. The only thing missing was the Hot Tub to relax in!After our evening appointment we arrived back at the boat and drank in the bar and then retired to our rooms. The beds were very comfortable and the shower was powerful and roomy. The toiletries were also of a high standard and usable! Each room also has an iron, trouser press and hair drier and plenty of hanging space.Breakfast was adequate, the usual cereal, pastries and hot food. I asked for poached eggs and although cooked to order they were tinged with the taste of vinegar, so disappointing - but hey! Ninety nine pounds and vinegary poached egg with everything else magnificent wasn't so bad!There were plenty of magazines and newspapers to read that were free of charge and plenty of areas to relax. If it was sunny and warm then the terraces would have been ideal to enjoy a glass or two of Pimms!There is ONLY one downside to staying at the Sunborn and that is, if you are travelling on your own and using the Docklands Light Railway (purchase your ticket from the machine BEFORE you travel) - take care! Personally, I wouldn't. I would use a cab instead. Although the distance between Prince Regent station and the boat is minimal, at night and on your own you are vulnerable.But I do want to finish on a high note and so... the Sunborn is a great place to stay and I can't wait to book my next trip."
58,1179,Mar 15 2006	Looking for something different!	Went to the Sunborn Yacth Hotel for our anniversary. Had a fantastic room with river view. Hotel staff are very freindly and helpful.The cooked breakfast wasn't great but for 89 all in i wasn't complaining!Will be going back when it is a bit warmer.We went to the floating Lotus Leaf Chinese Resturant which is a 10 minute cab ride away (hotel cab service very good)or you can get there by DLR. Great food and very cheap considering where it is. We have also stayed at The Old Railway Station - have a look on the internet - fantastic!
59,1179,"Feb 28 2006	Super rooms little else	Stayed 3 nights at the end of February. Probably the largest hotel rooms in London for the price. However the hotel has little else to offer. The desk is badly run, requests are written down on bits of paper and then not fulfilled as requested or forgotten all together. The food was the same for every one of the 3 mornings we were there. Although a large dining room not all area used so queues form at peak times. It is a 45 minute journey into central london , so if the reason for your visit is to see as many attractions as you can during the day and then come back to change for a night out in town you have to take 3 hours out of your day. In addition after a show and a meal in town you are racing across town for the last train at 12.44. On arrival at the boat you are faced with a 10 min walk across the Excel conference centre car park with cars cruising past you with not another soul in sight. Because of barriers you have to follow the footpaths you cannot walk as the crow flies to the boat. If you are attending the Excell centre an excellent location, however not the base for 3 or 4 days to sightsee london."
60,1179,"Feb 12 2006	Sunborne Yacht Hotel	Just spent four days at the Sunborne Yacht Hotel, London. No problem finding the location. Using the underground and Dockland light railway was quite simple even for four pensioners. The room was clean and comfortable. Staff were very helpful and breakfast was very well presented and a good selection of hot and cold food. The hotel would be convenient if you were travelling by air using City Airport. If ever we are in London again we would not hesitate to book this hotel."
61,1179,"Feb 6 2006	Spacious and friendly	Booked a standard (no balcony) double at an incredible rate of 69. Nothing &quot;standard&quot; about the room - very spacious, well furnished, with a separate seating area. The bathroom is shower only but you'd expect this for a yacht. Front desk service was excellent. When I mentioned we were meeting friends at the nearby Yi-Ban restaurant (a superb Chinese and good alternative to the pricey ships restaurant) the receptionist gave me a chit for two free drinks. The ship has a large bar but otherwise there is limited public space. Also, the yacht is hardly in the prettiest of settings;- large concrete car park on one side and not the best part of the Thames on the other. However, for value for money and a room at least twice the size of anything you would find in London at double the price, it is well worth it."
62,1179,"Jan 24 2006	What a great find!	We were a bit aprehensive at going to this floating hotel after getting such a great price from the internet...something had to be wrong... How wrong was I! It was perfect! Although, a 30 minute tube ride to the &quot;West End&quot;, the difference in price allowed us to dine at restaurants we would have given a miss to,if we were staying in any of the dearer 4 star hotels in Central London. From the uniqueness - to the service, quality and the unbeleivably comfortable beds, this hotel made our short stay in London memorable and we cant wait to return."
63,1179,"Jan 23 2006	know the score	I have read most of the reviews on this place and I think if you choose to stay here, you need to enquire as to the events taking place on your choice of date. You also need to request in advance the type of room you want and if a balcony room is your choice (which it should be) you must ask that you are put on the river side. Also ask if there is entertainment planned. Bad points are that there is not much of a view on the car park side (where excel sits), there is not much in the immediate area and the nearest general shop is a fifteen minute walk. But the balcony room that me and my girlfriend stayed in was excellent. Remember that there is no bath, just a spacious walk-in shower and if you want an iron, you have to request one. The river side view is nice in the evening and creates an atmosphere of privacy. This is why the yacht hotel is suited for a quiet, relaxing stay-hence why you need to make sure there are no parties planned! The hotel was not busy when we stayed but again, that is not bad if you are looking for quiet romance (the restaurant was empty and we had the best candlelit table and our own waiter, who was very good). The food is very pricey but if you want to spoil yourselves then give it a try. We were worried that the a la carte menu would leave us hungry so kept crisps in our room. However, the food was in good proportion and was one of the best meals I have ever had. A question that you may ask is, was that because we were the only diners? I would like to think not. We certainly did'nt need the crisps. We encountered no other problem. Hope this helps your decision-if you do your homework, I would recommend it."
64,1179,"Dec 1 2005 	Tremendous	A real find, with First Class service nothing was too much trouble Front of House, and its very comfortable.Excellent value for the area."
65,1179,"Nov 16 2005	good value!	We booked a 3 night weekend stay here with some trepidation as we'd seen some unfavorable reviews regarding noise at night from the funtion room they have at the hotel, but as we got a great deal at 'laterooms' (89 per room per night including full english) and it looked so nice we decided to go for it, and we're glad we did! We asked for a quiet room with a river view and balcony, and thats exactly what we got. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The whole place was spotless and was better that in the pictures! Our room was so quiet that we almost thought we were the only ones in the hotel! Beds are the most comfy i've ever slept in. Having seen the function room, i can imagine the level of noise if it was being used - maybe check at booking with the hotel if there are any functions on...? The only downside is that it is quite a way from the city centre, and a little bit of a trek from the railway to the hotel if you had luggage (its about 5-10 minute walk at most) but you get much better value for money - to get rooms and service like we had in the city centre would cost at least 4 times that. The restaurant was expensive (althou it looked really good) so we didnt try it, but would recommend the short trip to canary wharf (we used to stop here on our way back from sightseeing in the centre) as there are some nice bars and restaurants - there's an amazing italian (cant remember the name) which was at a really good price (less than 10 for a main meal)"
66,1179,Oct 3 2005	Something different	We loved staying on &quot;something different&quot; and the cost was good too.You must go for the balcony room facing the water. DO NOT except a car park view as you will be dissapointed.
67,1179,"Sep 26 2005 	Excellent Value	We stayed here for one night and I must say the rooms are wonderful, very spacious, clean and nicely presented. The reception staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Although it is a bit out of the way its only a few minutes walk to the Docklands Light Railway and you can get anywhere around the tourist sites of London for 5.20 with an off peak ticket. We got bed and breakfast for 114 which I felt was very good value for money.We will definately be staying here again when we next come down to London."
68,1179,Sep 20 2005	Loved Every Minute	I was a little bit dubious about staying at this hotel as I had read the reviews on here beforehand. I need not have worried! It was great! Myself and my partner stayed here for a romantic weekend with a difference and that was exactly what we got!I have got nothing to complain about and neither had he. The staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were lovely. The food on the yacht was overpriced but with the DLR just outside it takes less than 15 mins to get into London. We booked our room through late rooms and they were also the best on price by far. We will definately be staying at this hotel anytime we want to stay in London.
69,1179,"Aug 30 2005	A Fantastic Treat!	We stayed at the Sunborn on the 27th August 2005, just for a bit of a treat over the bank holiday weekend. We paid 149.00, this included a three course meal and full english breakfast. I have to say that this place was fantastic. The suite was very luxurious, room service 24 hours a day, pay movies, broadband access-it was lovely. We were lucky enough to get a balcony, views are nothing special from the boat though as one side overlooks a car park and the other is Docklands on the Thames! We were very well looked after, I am vegetarian so I pre warned when booking as the meal thrown in is from a set menu. I ended up with a beautfiul meal from the a la carte menu. My partner ate from the set menu and he really enjoyed his meal also. After dinner we went to the bar and had a drink, not much else to do on the boat apart from that really-so its great for couples who just want to spend some time together in a bit of luxury! We went back to the room and ordered a movie, a tad expensive at 8.45, but they do have latest offerings (and PS2 games but I do not know the cost of these). Breakfast was a buffet and had everything you could have wanted and some more! We went to breakfast at about 9.40 and had to wait a while (about half a hour) . This was ok though as we took advantage of the free papers while we were waiting.All in all I would totally reccomend this Hotel. It is unusual and I think the 149.00 (a special rate which lasts till June 2006 I think)is an absolute bargain!"
70,1179,"Jul 11 2005	don't try calling	I didn't actually stay at the Sunborn, but my son did for three days with a group of students. Each and every single time I tried to call (8 times total) the receptionist would give excuses as to why he couldn't take my call. I was told my son was in a meeting, sleeping, eating breakfast or his phone had been blocked because others in the hotel had been playing on the phone. Whatever the excuse was, it was clear that the staff didn't want to be bothered with phone calls. One time when I called I was placed on hold for 20 minutes (I was calling from the U.S.). I finally hung up and called back. When I called back, the desk clerk immediately got defensive with me when I explained that I had bee holding for so long. I'm not sure what it is like to stay at this hotel, but based on this experience, I don't want to find out."
71,1179,"Jun 6 2005	Good Deal at Sunborn	My partner and I booked this online at 68% off the original price and felt that, with the discount, it was a very good deal. It's a little out of the way in the Docklands and the view isn't terrific (across the water you have the view of the now ancient and dilapidated Millennium Mills factory), but the rooms are very pleasant and well equipped. By the way, there's a nice Thai restaurant located at the very end of the docks, about a 10 min walk from the yacht, called Nakhon Thai Restaurant."
72,1179,"May 16 2005	Splendid rooms	Stayed for one night - Scenery not fantastic but very impressed with Yacht. One problem on checking in established there was a private function taking place in the hotel restaurant that night- this meant we were unable to have a meal that evening other than in the bar. A Chinese restaurant about 10 mins walk was recommended and was booked on our behalf with a complimentary drink thrown in (nice gesture). On our arrival at the restaurant it was like having a meal with a 5 piece band playing in your ear we did not go in and went to the Ramada Hotel instead - had a fab meal there. The suite in the yacht was fantastic very comfortable, staff very friendly - no hangers, unsure if it was just our room. Overall had a wonderful time DLR connections right next to hotel so not a problem getting around. Would reccommend for that special occassion."
73,1179,"Apr 26 2005	Huge rooms for London	We stayed for one night at the Sunborn Yacht hotel. Our reason for chosing the hotel was it's location as it was convenient for us. We got a good deal on lastminute and weren't expecting anything special. We only arrived at the hotel at 11pm and had to leave again at 7am so we didn't see much of the hotel, however, our room was fabulous...big and clean with a huge, very comfortable bed and separate lounge area. We very much enjoyed our short but sweet stay here and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in this area."
74,1179,"Mar 16 2005	Fantastic for a special occasion	Celebrated my husbands 40th birthday on the Sunborn, We had a great time the yacht was everything we imagined &quot;just like the pictures&quot;.When you book strongly request a river view or you will most likely get a carpark view. We also requested a quiet room and got it - through laterooms,the suites were of a very high standard and the beds were very comfortable.Only had breakfast but it was very good value for money.On the down side it is a little far out, but if you plan your days well, you can cope using the docklands light railway &amp; the tube( approx 6.00 for the day )We had a couple of special nights out and decided to use a cab, the yacht has its own car which is very reasonably priced( same if not cheaper than the black cabs).I think you could negotiate a little discount though.Glad we went for our special occasion, not sure I would stay there if we just went to sightsee, but for that little something special...try it you wont be dissapointed."
75,1179,"Dec 22 2004	Rip off - Stay here at your peril	My girlfriend and I stayed here overnight in December 04 with 2 children, one of whom played on the TV games console, which seemed a little pricey at 5.75. At check out I was charged NINE TIMES OVER for this privilege, as he had paused the game when we went out sightseeing, and apparently the cost is per hour; this is a total scam, and I could probably have bought the entire games console for this price - NO WAY WERE THE MANAGEMENT GOING TO CONSIDER A REFUND. You will also note in the in-room Service Directory that Room Service Breakfast costs 14.95 pp, which you might perhaps think a little pricey. Go for it; we took the continental Buffet Breakfast in the 5th floor restaurant, and were charged 17.75 pp - this included no hot food whatsoever, and we explicitly turned down the &quot;Full English&quot; option despite being repeatedly pestered to accept it. Again, NO WAY WERE THE MANAGEMENT GOING TO CONSIDER A REDUCTION, although the selection on offer was no more than pastries, stewed fruit and cold meats; there was also cheese, but the Camembert was date-expired (as were some of the flower arrangements).I have stayed in hotels the world over and have never once been ripped off so blatantly; yes the rooms are good, the hotel is slightly exotic, and the Expedia pricing extremely attractive, but this is GOUGING AT IT'S WORST and I have now written to the London Evening Standard, Time Out and to the local Trading Standards Officer.The location is extremely inconvenient in December, but the kids thought it was fairly cool staying on a yacht. My own reaction to the final bill was not cool. I SUGGEST YOU AVOID THIS HOTEL OR RISK UNPLEASANT SURPRISES AT CHECKOUT."
76,1179,"Nov 16 2004 	Different and enjoyable	My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Sunborn Yacht recently. We were over for WTM at Excel - location coudn't have been better, a 2 minute stroll from our room to the centre. Some distance from town though ! If you do intend to travel to city centre do not use the local minicab company the hotel use - call a London Taxi (black cab) much cheaper by far. Local mini cab driver tried to charge us the same fare to the city airport (5 minute drive) as a taxi cost us to Whitehall the night before ! Our room was very spacious but cold. Seems there was a problem with the heating in our room. A call to reception had the janitor quickly dispatched, very friendly but was unable to fix. He did arrange for a portable oil filled heater to be supplied, it was a pity the staff didn't think to plug it in and turn it on for us (small niggle).Overall very pleasant and friendly staff, nice ambience, ideal for Excel &amp; City Airport, far from city centre though."
77,1179,"Nov 1 2004	Fantastic	I have just spent the most wonderful weekend on this yacht hotel. Our room was fantastic (and they gave us a balcony overlooking the river!), clean and excellent value for money (we booked through late rooms). The location is out of the way (easily accessible by the light railway - last train 12.30am ish) but well worth escaping the tourist mayhem of the city centre. I cannot comment on the restaurant as we came armed with snacks/red wine (note there are no shops close by)but the bar was very relaxing and prices reasonable for Amstel lager. I look forward to returning to this hotel again."
78,1179,"Sep 6 2004	Certainly different	Booked a deluxe suite with balcony and river view as surprise for birthday beginning of September. Yes, it is difficult to get to and the view isn't exactly picturesque but inside the staircase and chandelier do try to create an atmosphere of yacht luxury and the suite was lovely. The staff were very pleasant and helpful but SO inexperienced, not what you'd expect from the world's only floating hotel. Food was very good but the singer and guitar was TOO loud. We'd come for a romantic meal and could hardly hear each other.. I asked for a glass of champagne and the staff were fighting about not being THE one to open the bottle! When it was opened at our table, the waiter did a great job, shame he let it spill down the bottle and on to the floor-he didn't have a glass ready. Then when I went to take a drink, there was something floating in it. There was no problem having it exchanged but I do wish a fresh glass had been brought to the table and the champagne poured into it instead of taking the glass away into the kitchen and emerging with a full glass...When a waitress poured some red wine into my glass she accidentally spilled it on my bag, the tablecloth and down the glass. The wines were horrendously expensive and the house Merlot was too warm. When we went to get a post dinner drink in the bar , the till wasn't working so nothing could be paid for by cah and non-residents could not be served as the drinks were allocated to rooms. There really should have been a back up to deal with this type of problem. The piano playing in the background was just right volume wise but the lighting made the bar look like a casino. Don't think I'd go again , not because of the little niggles but because of the location."
79,1179,Aug 29 2004	wonderful	what a wonderful break we had. the staff were so helpful. we were given a balcony suite which gave us lovely views of the dome; canary wharf; london city airport.all fixtures and fittings on the yacth are of the highest quality it is sheer luxury the breakfasts are divine and served by very friendly staff who cant do enough to make your stay a unforgettable one go midweek to avoid party noise.

1,1200,"Great Location -- Nice European Hotel	Stayed here over the long &quot;Thanksgiving Holiday&quot; - first time to London and thought this is a charming, nice location hotel. I couldn't have been more happy. Compared to other hotels I have stayed in Europe the room wasn't SUPER small...."
2,1200,"Nov 23 2009 	Fab Hotel	Stayed for one week at the Cavendish executive room, the service was top notch location very exclusive, within walking distance of Picadilly and Mayfair. Surrounded by fabulous shops and restaurants. Ask for a room in the higher floors, you get a view of the London Eye and Big Ben. Hotel Service is great and very accomodating."
3,1200,"Nov 20 2009 	Great Location nice service small-ish rooms	The Cavendish is very centrally located - my travelling companion and I used our Oyster cards much more rarely than had we stayed further out from central London. It was a 7 minute walk to Trafalgar Sq., or Leicester Sq., and not much further to the ENO or many of the theatres of the West End. The two of us shared an executive king room, which was not overly large, and was a little sparse on storage space, but was otherwise quite comfortable. Breakfast had been included in our rate, and was better than average for a hotel of this level of luxury. The staff was attentive - we ate in the hotel dining room for dinner, and were asked about our meal not only at the time it was served, but also the next morning at breakfast. The only niggling criticisms that I have are that the hangers in the armoire could not be unfastened from the rod (though they were designed to be able to do so), and the &quot;joystick&quot; controls on the bathroom sink were difficult to calibrate temperature and velocity of water, and the very &quot;designer&quot; bowl-shaped sinks were not practical, at least in my experience. The shower and tub were both quite lovely - good water pressure for both, and the tub was large enough to lounge in."
4,1200,"Nov 15 2009 	Great Location and Friendly Staff	This hotel was the first hotel in London to win the &quot;Green Hotel&quot; award so if lowering your impact on the environment while travelling is important to you, this is an accommodation to consider. We stayed one night at the Cavendish while on a shopping and theatre visit. The hotel is tucked away nicely behind Fortnum and Mason and is within easy walking distance of West End theatres and restaurants. Our room was spotlessly clean and all rooms are non-smoking which deserves an award in itself. The staff were friendly and willing to assist with queries.Breakfast was included with our rate and was very delicious with ample and varied selection. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and cheery - wait staff seemed to abound and attended to our every need.The only slight criticism was that room sizes are on the small side but you do expect that in London. There were no robes in the room which would have been a nice touch. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel!!!"
5,1200,"Nov 10 2009 	Well Worth the Splurge!	We decided to splurge for our five nights in London last July, at the end of our English family holiday. We were able to get a bit of a deal, by reserving and paying well in advance. And given our package included breakfast, it was not bad value overall.The hotel is lovely - very modern decore and is ideally situated between Picadilly and Green Park subway stops. It is just a short walk to St. James Palace, with Buckingham Palace not too far away. We were wary of hotels near Picadilly, as we'd been told they could be noisy, but this was not the case and we would not hesitate to recommend the Cavendish. And if you are in the market for men's shirts, Jermyn Street had many choices!We were booked into a higher-end room - I believe it was a junior suite. It was located on the top floor. One took the elevator to the top, and then went up a flight of stairs - via some windows with fabulous views of London. Of course, someone carried our bags for us. The room was very large, with great eastward views. There was a very comfortable king bed, and a full-size pull-out couch for our daughter. With the couch open, it was a bit cosy, but there was a whole separate area raised a step or two with another lounging chair and lamp, and a small table. The pull-out couch was fine - but a bit lumpy. However, when I asked for a second duvet, one was brought to us immediately. With that for padding underneath, my daughter was quite content.The bathroom was exquisite - large soaker tub, separate shower, and large vanity with lots of room to put all our things. There were two very large closets with drawers and adequate room to hang clothes for all three of us.The breakfast buffet was plentiful, with good choices and variety day-to-day. Although it would have been hideously expensive to buy on its own, it made our room a reasonably good deal. The breakfast room was quite busy on the weekend, but the service was still very cheerful and competent. Genearlly, we found the staff were very accommodating.Our only complaint at all was the elevators. One was out of service for a couple of days, and with the hotel fully booked, it got a bit slow to get around, especially to breakfast. However, this did nothing to dampen our enthusiasm for such a nice hotel. It was well worth the splurge!"
6,1200,"Nov 6 2009 	Excellent centrally situated hotel	We have stayed at the Cavendish before and thoroughly enjoyed it. This time we stayed in a Superior room, and I have to say it was well worth the extra for that extra bit of room. Staff excellent, hotel excellent, general stay excellent. I love coming to this hotel, as it is centrally based for all our &quot;retail therapy&quot; as well as you can park the car (underneath the hotel) overnight at a very reasonable rate. Cannot wait to go back and stay. Truly.Thanks to all the staff at the Cavendish."
7,1200,"Nov 2 2009 	Great stay at the Cavendish....	I booked the Cavendish Hotel for my husbands 30th birthday as a surprise..what a great hotel! the hotel is in a great location, is modern, spotless and very welcoming. We stayed in a double superior room which was spacious and had all the mod coms. before i arrived i had rang the hotel to ask if we could have a room with a view as it was my husbands birthday...The room they gave us was on the 10th floor with amazing views of the London eye, aslo the hotel had a big chocolate cake and birthday card delivered to our room..which i thought was lovely. I would definatley recommend this hotel!!! Great stay in London...!!!"
8,1200,"Oct 30 2009 	Sleek Hotel Great Location	I had a very hard time choosing a hotel in London - many of the decent ones were quite expensive, and the ones in my price range were in far-off locations. The Cavendish was a relatively low price for a four star hotel in London, and my travel package came with buffet breakfast, so I decided on this one and am very glad I did. The Cavendish is a sleek, modern hotel located near Picadilly Circus, so the location is excellent. However, it should be noted that the hotel is on a quiet little side street a few blocks AWAY from Picadilly, and I got a little bit lost with all the little winding streets a couple of times. The room was excellent, but it was on the fourth floor and didn't have much of a view - it looked straight into the facade of another building (which, according to my London guide, is actually a very good fancy department store). I would say to ask for a room on a higher floor. It was a bit hard to control the temperature, and it always seemed a bit cold, but the beds were AMAZINGLY soft. It was very hard to get up in the morning!The breakfast is also very good. The buffet is the same everyday and comes with the standard fare: tea, coffee, cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, jam, bagels, etc. It was a good breakfast, but if it doesn't come included in your vacation package, I would recommend not taking it because it's about 30 pounds a day! Definitely not worth it. One thing that irks me about classy hotels is that they feel justified to charge you for internet, which the Cavendish does as well. However, internet is free in the lobby, and they have a very cozy sitting area with many outlets to plug laptops into. If you need to print something out, there are a measly three computers in the lobby, and they are free for 15 minutes of use. Overall, the location was awesome (within walking distance to the touristy areas of Picadilly and even Trafalgar Square), the rooms were comfortable, and the breakfast was good."
9,1200,"Oct 27 2009 	Very nice hotel	We stayed at the Cavendish for three nights. We stayed in a superior room on the 14th floor. The room was small, but the bathroom was large and well-appointed. The view was excellent, especially at night. It's location is top notch for restaurants, pubs and theater. It's a 5 minute walk to tube stops and about 15 to the Thames at Westminster. The decor was a little too trendy and modern for our taste. We didn't find it particularly comfortable. The bar was particularly spartan, hence the lack of patrons. But the lounge on the next floor up was more comfortable, if inconsistent service-wise. The concierge service was very helpful, taking care of our reservations, directions and travel plans."
10,1200,"Oct 27 2009 	Good quality at a reasonable price and great location	We stayed for two nights in October in a classic room. The location was ideal for us with the main theatre district,shopping and many major attractions all within walking distance. Immediately behind Fortnum &amp; Mason on Jermyn Street, the location is quiet and almost perfect for central London.Rooms are a little small compared to many but you can upgrade. Decor is modern and facilities good although it's shower only at the lower end of the price range. The TV was distinguished by having the most complicated menu system of any I've experienced but it's hardly a major issue. The public areas are well appointed but very quiet when we were there. No bar scene here I'm afraid. Breakfast and the main restaurant are on the first floor and some tables have pleasant views of Jermyn Street. You can have breakfast in your room at no extra charge. I recommend it as the wait to be seated in the restaurant was unacceptible on the morning we went (and it was only half full anyway). Choice isn't vast but it was good quality. All the staff were very pleasant - some excellent. This hotel is a great base for a leisure trip to London. It isn't a destination in itself but a stay here will still enhance your trip."
11,1200,"Oct 9 2009 	Great location great staff	Hotel was really central, you could walk to Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street, so right in the main shopping district as well as being able to walk to Buckingham Palace. Other major sightseeing attractions were only a few stops on the tube. Room was great, one of the cleanest we've stayed in. All the staff at the hotel were really friendly and ready to offer their help with anything. Overall a really good stay at a really good hotel."
12,1200,"Oct 8 2009 	Great location excellent service and rooms	Great location excellent staff and service...The only negative was that when teh room was serviced &quot;we stayed for 11 nights&quot; it was never dusted, ever..Apart from that it is definatley where we would stay in London every time"
13,1200,"Oct 6 2009 	Cavendish Hotel or Hotel Cavendish?	I was dreading my stay at this hotel as I had booked it before reading the reviews - which were terrible! All I can say is that this hotel is wonderful - location, staff, food and rooms were all fantastic. On returning home I checked the reviews and realised that there is also a Cavendish Hotel (or is it Hotel Cavendish?) in Gower Street, Bloomsbury, and that had been the hotel reviews I had read. Surely this must cause problems with people booking the wrong hotel, and from the revews, I think this must be the case.The staff at the Cavendish, Jermyn Street, are really friendly and welcoming and our room, although a bit small, was perfectly formed! The comfiest bed I've ever slept in, and a beautiful bathroom with lots of soft fluffy towels. The breakfasts were delicious and we also had a pre-theatre dinner where the food was excellent. We had a view of the London Eye from our window which was lovely to see all lit up at at night. We stayed four nights and did not use the tube once - anywhere you could possibly want to go is within walking distance of this central hotel. I would stay at this hotel again whenever in London."
14,1200,"Sep 26 2009 	BOOK IT!	I stayed at the Cavendish for 9 days and I think it was worth every penny! The location is great (by tube stations, entertainment, food, shopping, theater), staff are oh so helpful and amazing, the rooms are so clean and lovely, breakfast is great and freshly made.The hotel is in a nice cute side street by Piccadilly and it takes about 3 min to get to Piccadilly station and about 5 min to Green park. There are different restaurants and bars with in walking distance. since the area is somewhat touristy I found it very lively till very late at night and very safe to walk around. Make sure to walk everywhere since Regent street, Carnaby and bond street are all the clubs are about 5-15 min walk from the hotel. So take advantage of that. The hotel rooms are very clean and the beds are the most comfortable beds I have every slept on. one of the great services they offer is you can order your breakfast in bed if you dont want to wake up early to catch the buffet hours in the morning. just make sure you fill out the form fr it the night before and hang it out by 2am. Its good for wkend mornings. for internet they have 15 min passes for free, 30 min i think for 5 and 60 min for 10 and so on. We used the computers in the lobby pretty much everyday so we just used the free 15min passes.i read some reviews about the hotel saying the rooms were too small. we had the superior room and it was fine for 2 people. again London hotels are usually small and i thought for the location and the fact that the hotel is not that new at least our room for pretty good size.i cant think of any negative points about the hotel. so just book it! im sure you'll like it!"
15,1200,"Sep 22 2009 	Amazing location and friendly staff.	We stayed a week at the Cavendish and truly enjoyed our stay. The location can't be beat, within walking distance of two Tube stops, Soho and the West End, Buckingham Palace and other major tourist attractions as well as some of London's best shopping. The bed was exceedingly comfy and the room quite roomy by London standards. The staff were relentlessly cheerful and helpful. The only downside: our room was a communicating room with the one next door, and voices travelled trough the doors. However, I would love to stay at the Cavendish again."
16,1200,"Sep 21 2009 	Fanatastic	Just returned from a wonderful weekend staying at the Cavendish. Had booked on line got a great deal, then got upgraded to a suite.. We use to be regular visitors to this hotel in the past, but for some reason the last time we went ,about 5 years ago, something put us off and we did not return untill this weekend. Mainly due to the positive reviews on TP. The Cavendish was great. Location is unbeatable, everything in close walking distance. We had breakfast served in our room, arrived spot on 10 o'clock as requested. Nice touch was the follow up phone call checking we had everything we wanted. Could not fault the hotel or especially the staff. We will return.PS If you are lucky enough to get a suite ask to face East I think the view is probably better."
17,1200,"Sep 20 2009 	LocationLocation Location!	This was my first trip to London and I chose to stay at the Cavendish after reading the great reviews on Trip Advisor and loved it. My husband and I stayed in a superior room which some reviewers complain is small but c'mon, if your staying in London you really shouldn't have an excuse to be spending that much time in your room anyway! The Superior room boasts a comfy queen size bed with a tall headboard and small but modern outfitted bathroom with shower/bathtub and a heated towel rack. The beds were very soft with thick duvets and I had no problems falling asleep. Anytime we came back from an outing our room was always spotless and smelled fantastic, in fact the whole hotel smells awesome. Everyone from reception, concierge and housekeeping were very helpful and friendly and eager to please. Another plus is that the hotel has won awards for it's sustainabilty efforts, which is pretty cool. We did not indulge in the breakfasts as there are so many places close by where you can grab a fast bite to eat , like the Tesco market or pret a manger cafes. Also the Fortnum and Mason department store across from the Cavendish has a really great Ice cream Parlour that is fabulous! I can't say enough how convenient the location was as it is between two tube stations Piccadilly Circus and Green Park and really within walking distance of so many attractions. There also is so much fantastic shopping close by on Oxford street and Bond street that I was able to frequently drop off shopping parcels back to the room to hide before my husband came back from his museum outings haha. My one problem was the nightclub beside Fortnum's had some loud revelers during the weekend so it was a little noisy, that's no fault of the Cavendish though and other than that it was pretty quiet. Overall I really loved my stay at the Cavendish and I would definitely stay here again when visiting London."
18,1200,"Sep 13 2009 	Short City Trip	Visited the Cavendish Hotel on Jermyne Street which we booked on short notice after deciding to go on a short city trip to London. We found to hotel to be very well located (St. James's/Mayfair), the room to be very good although a bit smaller than we expected (it was a 'superior room') with excellent batchroom and facilities. It was a nice touch to see that the usual plastic keycard was changed into a similar plastic thing but this time old-fashioned key shaped ;-)The hotel is in a quiet side street just off Picadilly, without the street noise that goes with a big city. Room is with automatic airconditioning that starts when you enter the room automatically - something we don't like so that was a manual switch off every time. Window could be opened but only for some 15cm / 6 inches, which is not how we like it but what airco'ed hotel offers full open windows nowadays?We booked an advanced payment which included the breakfast buffet, and we liked it. Coffee and toast if asked was brought to the table and the buffet was good - not outrageous but decent. Oh - they did have trouble with coffee brewing though - either too weak or too strong.The room was furnished with nice pillows/cushions, earth-coloured materials. Very soft and comfortable bed, no wooden plank at the end (i'm kinda tall) so plenty of room. Room contained the standard coffee/tea brewer and also an electricity converter which we brought ourselves.Overall a very good hotel, not too expensive given the great spot in the city amidst the best streets for shopping (our main purpose for the short stay) and we definitely would go back the next time."
19,1200,Sep 11 2009 	quiet hotel in the heart of the city	The hotel is in an excellent location within a posh area of london and most things are within walking distance. The rooms are well presented and at breakfast there was a wide selection all of good quality. Nice hotel for a short city break.
20,1200,"Sep 9 2009 	Great Location and Great Deal	I was able to book this hotel at a discounted rate on hotels.com that included breakfast, which was convenient. The rooms were clean and the service was great. The concierge was very accommodating and helped make my stay in London seamless."
21,1200,"Sep 7 2009 	Excellent Stay at the Cavendish	We enjoyed a one night stay at the Cavendish. I would echo previous comments about this Hotel. Decor is excellent, breakfast superb and everywhere spotlessly clean. However the rooms aren't exactly huge. We booked an Executive room and it was OK size wise so the basic rooms must be a squeeze.Overall The Cavendish is highly recommended."
22,1200,Sep 2 2009 	Rooms way to small-great location	The Cavendish is a nice hotel and conveniently located however I stayed in a classic double room with a friend and it was incredibly small. I struggled getting my two suitcases into the room and definitely couldn't open my two bags at the same time. Even if I was by myself it would have been a little tight but I would have been able to better deal with it. I brought up my dissatification with the room size to the manager and he was not all accomodating or seemed the least bit interested in what I was saying. I'm from Washington D.C. and this vacation was my very first to the UK. Because I was so far away from home I was willing to be for convenience and comfort. I didn't receive an adequate comfort level and will not select this hotel for future visits to the UK.
23,1200,"Sep 1 2009 	Highly recommended - I loved it!	Stayed for one night at the end of august - me for leisure and my partner for business. Can't fault this hotel in any way - we received a complimentary upgrade on arrival and were offered drinks discounts at their bar. The room (superior) was lovely with a big flat screen tv, a DAB radio and CD player and the most amazing view across London which I could see from the comfort of my bed. The bed was possibly the comfiest I have ever had the fortune to sleep in and the bathroom was beautiful and most importantly very clean! Our room was right next to a lift however I never heard any noise the whole time I was there, in fact I wasn't disturbed by anything and given half a chance could have slept forever!On arriving for breakfast we were seated straight away and once again I cannot fault it - my eggs benedict were perfect and the service from the staff was first class - I didn't need to eat until dinnertime!I spent some time in their lounge during the morning and I was so well looked after by very attentive waiters.All in all, The Cavendish comes highly recommended - its very central and I really enjoyed my stay - in fact I'd stay here at least once a week if it was up to me!"
24,1200,"Aug 30 2009 	Outstanding!!	We stayed in a junior suite and it was faultless.Service was great, the room was spotless and the bed was huge!!Views over the city were fantastic!!Well worth going for a junior suite for a special occasion."
25,1200,"Aug 25 2009 	Great location great hotel	The main reason for staying in this hotel has to be its location - at the back door of Fortnum and Masons (just off Piccadilly) this is just a short walk away from the main sites (Regents St., Oxford St, Leicester Square and Shaftesbury Ave). The entrance is low key and the reception area is modern. The reception staff and concierge were very helpful. As we were staying there for a birthday, they put a cake and a card in the room for us, which was a lovely touch and certainly the only time that has happened before! The room was very nice - exceptionally clean and modern with everything you'd need, plus some little extras, like an iron and ironing board. A 42&quot; TV and a CD player and a queen sized bed made the room very luxurious. Although the room is a little on the small side, we expected that being a central London hotel, and was certainly of adequate if not ample size. The bathroom was very modern and made you feel like you were staying somewhere a little bit special. We paid 150 ish for the hotel with breakfast (which was a quite average buffet serve-yourself affair) and were not disappointed with what we got for our money. We'd go back there again."
26,1200,"Aug 24 2009 	Luxury?	The hotel claims to be 4 star Luxury but dont expect to get this in the Standard Double. The bed in my room was designed for people no taller than 58 so was not entirely comfortable for me at 62 tall. This may be so that there was room to get past the end of the bed in the narrow room. Unfortunately this spoilt what would have been a perfect stay at the hotel. The hotel is in a great location, the staff were all pleasant and helpful and the breakfast buffet very good (included in the room price).We stayed a Friday and Saturday night and even though the hotel was full on the Saturday (I tried to upgrade for the second night) it seemed very quiet. I would stay there again but would have to pay more to ensure I get the luxury of a decent bed."
27,1200,"Aug 24 2009 	Don't choose ""classic room""!!	The hotel is not bad, but the rooms are too too too... small. I stayed in the classic room and choose this hotel because it has breakfast included and I did read good reviews about. Choose for this hotel ONLY if you will not stay in &quot;classic room&quot;."
28,1200,Aug 23 2009 	Best value by far	WE have just returned from another very pleasant stay. Not much needs to be said - this continues to be the best price / location / breakfast value hotel in this area of London.
29,1200,"Aug 23 2009 	Fine Central London Hotel!	Stayed for one night at The Cavendish on the basis of previous reviews and I have to agree with many others that this is an excellent hotel. Superbly situated in St James' and within easy walking distance of major attractions and the West End we had a room on the 9th Floor with good open views. The room was an excellent size and was very well equiped, particularly in respect of the state of the art TV and entertainment system. We did not use any of the hotels facilities so cannot comment on this but the price (booked through Expedia) was reasonable for this part of London on our past experience. A familiar moan though about why London hotels cannot include breakfast in the cost when you are paying 150+ for accommodation!"
30,1200,"Aug 22 2009 	I feared the worst	Having read so many negative reviews of both hotel staff and the manager Ciaran in particular, it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I booked this hotel. I chose it because of its proximity to Trafalgar Square and because they were offering an online reduced rate deal. Its location alone was worth the money but any fears that I had weren't realised as we had a first class stay. The concierge was excellent as were the house and breakfast staff. The reception staff and porters though could have done with some training in civility.The room was spotless and very quiet. we had ordered a cot for our 1 year old in advance and arrived to an open futon which wasn't suitable. This was resolved within minutes as was the difficult tuning of our tv. A word of caution however. We had removed all of the items from the minibar as we wanted to use it to keep our daughters food cool. The next day I noticed that we had been charged for every item, 74. I explained that we didn't drink the contents and that they were still in the room. The receptionist informed us through clenched teeth that it was a minibar and not a fridge. It is only 9 degrees c and not suitable to prevent bacteria from forming in milk and baby food. Fair point. I didn't get charged in the end. Breakfast is 21 per head so watch out if it isn't included in your stay. Tesco down the street has an amazing selection of fresh food and great drink should you require anything. It has also won loads of awards for its 'green' credentials. I could write a whole review on this alone."
31,1200,"Aug 19 2009 	Wonderful place to stay	My husband, two sons age 20 and 17, and I spent two nights at The Cavendish London after a week visiting my husband's parents in Cambridge. We could not have been happier. We had two Superior rooms, one with a queen bed and one with two twins. Neither was especially large, but both were very comfortable. The views from our rooms out across London were wonderful and the views from the windows at the south end of the corridor on our floor were even better. The breakfast included with our room rate was exceptionally good.As others have said, the hotel is in a great location. It's close to lots of the things most people want to see when they come to London, but on a very quiet street. We walked to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, the theater and several of the central London parks. We had Oyster cards for travel on the Underground, but used them very little. The concierge was able to recommend several nice nearby pubs for lunch and dinner, though he seemed less familiar with moderately-priced restaurants in the area. Overall, the staff was very helpful without being at all intrusive.At 169 pounds per room per night, this was a bit of a splurge for us, but definitely worth it for the comfortable stay and the location. We had seen advertisements for smaller Standard rooms at the hotel starting at 129 pounds per room per night; none were available for our travel dates, but even the Superior rooms were not large and, judging from the plan for our floor, the Standard rooms would have seemed very small. Still, given the hotel's other amenities, if available they would be very good value."
32,1200,"Aug 13 2009	Excellent Hotel	This hotel ticks all the boxes. Nothing at all to complain about, and I am looking forward to staying again."
33,1200,"Aug 12 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Book book book!	Love this hotel. The other reviews here all seem to agree, so not much for me to say! Go for the Executive rooms if you can - well worth it. Request a high floor. Get breakfast included - its a really good spread. If your stay is for a special occasion let them know in advance - we got a REALLY nice birthday cake. Keep it up Cavendish; I will be back!"
34,1200,Aug 11 2009 	Lovely London Hotel!	We stayed at The Cavendish in late July for five nights and loved it! The location is fantastic and the rooms are nicely decorated and very clean and the staff was very helpful. We loved that our breakfast was included in the price of the room! It was so nice to walk downstairs and start out a long day of sightseeing with a delicious breakfast. Staying here helped make our first trip to London completely wonderful! We will be back!
35,1200,"Aug 9 2009 	good value great location	we booked this hotel for my birthday weekend and called ahead to organise a bottle of champagne. when we arrived in the room the champagne followed along with a birthday cake &amp; card courtesy of the hotel! the room was small but well equiped. the clenliness could have been better though (hairs in the shower).the first morning our room service order was lost but they made up for it by delivering two breakfasts extremely quickly once the error had been raised.do not book this hotel if you want to spend a lot of time in your room, the location is great &amp; we had a fantastic view which included the gherkin, london eye &amp; big ben"
36,1200,"Aug 3 2009 	Absolutely Fabulous Hotel - Everything Perfect	My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary this weekend and have had a fantastic time. The hotel is in a perfect location just minutes from Piccadilly on foot.From when we arrived on Saturday morning to when we left on Sunday afternoon we were treated like royalty. The staff were always polite, friendly and smiling. Nothing was too much trouble.On our arrival we were dealt with straight away by the reception staff, and, as it was a special occasion we were given a complimentary upgrade from our superior double to an executive double room. The room on the 12th floor was fantastic, just the right size with amazing views across London. We could see the London Eye, St Pauls Cathedral, everything - it was fantastic.The room itself was spotless with everything you could want. The bathroom had a double shower and bath - all immaculate.On Sunday morning our breakfast was delivered to our room spot on time at 08.45 and everything was cooked to perfection and was hot too. We were able to eat our breakfast in the comfort of our own room whilst overlooking London.This Hotel is by far the best hotel that I have ever stayed in and will definitely be back to stay here again - hopefully soon."
37,1200,"Jul 31 2009 	Great location and a fantastic breakfast	This is the hotel to stay if you want a great spot in London (5 minute walking from picadilly circus). The rooms are confortable, great bed, great view over London. The breakfast amazing. One suggestion to improve: Improve the elevators (long time waiting before getting one)."
38,1200,"Jul 31 2009 	Excellent hotel plus outstanding service!	Stayed in the hotel for a short break for my 21st birthday. Upon arrival i received a complimentary upgrade to a top floor superior room. Reception, bar and restaurant staff all brilliant. After a couple of hours i returned to my room to find a birthday cake and a card from the hotel! Views amazing. Perfect location. situated within walking distance to Bukingham Palace, Oxford Sreet and West End Shows. Cant wait to return!"
39,1200,"Jul 29 2009 	Great Value in Great Location	For the price there is little doubt that The Cavendish is one of the best bargains in London. If the primary purpose of your stay is theatre, there is no better location. It is easy walking distance to all the West End and The National and yet it's located on quiet Jermyn Street across the road from Fortnum &amp; Mason. Superior Room on the 11th floor had amazing views, top notch decor, wall mounted flat screen, spotless bath and was of a good size by London standards. Never once heard either street noise or other guests. The rate included a superb breakfast buffet including fresh juice, fruit salad, Scottish smoked salmon, a wide assortment of jams and wonderful pan de chocolat. In addition you can opt for a cooked to order full English breakfast or ala carte items such as eggs benedict at no extra charge. If you prefer, breakfast can be served in your room again at no extra charge. The staff couldn't be more courteous and helpful (a couple of minor billing discrepancies were quickly and pleasantly resolved) and free lobby WIFI access from a comfortable seat in the hotel lounge was a bonus. After more than thirty trips to London, I've finally found THE place to stay."
40,1200,"Jul 24 2009 	Tight space but great location.	My wife and I stayed here on the first part of our honeymoon. We upgraded for 20 BP per night for the &quot;larger&quot; room ... which was still tight, but good. Very shiek hotel &amp; room interior. Our room rate had breakfast included -- which was a good option.... the buffet was varied enough to satisfy most anyone. Remember to ask for toast or english muffin etc-- they will toast one up and bring it to your table - nice.You cannot beat the location -- walking to Picadilly &amp; Regent St is a snap; there are many great pubs for dinner/snacks/drinks nearby...one in particular, recommended by the hotel was the &quot;Blue Post&quot; -- very packed, but great food at resonable prices.The only weirdness -- perhaps it's a British thing -- was the shower. The &quot;door&quot; was just a short glass partition that didn't really do much good in keeping the water from going beyon the tub. Even with care, we'd get the sink area wet....of course it could just be us.We didn't use the on-premise pub etc...they were a bit pricy for us."
41,1200,"Jul 20 2009 	Outstanding service location and food.	Our family of 4 had 2 rooms at this stylish european hotel. A full English breakfast was included with the room. The restaurant was fabulous, the daily breakfast included a buffet as well as eggs cooked to order. The eggs benedict were superb. We enjoyed dinner twice at the hotel, once a pre-theatre special. Both meals were outstanding, I had a hard time convincing my family to eat anywhere else. However, when we did try other local restaurants we found the food and service to be excellent as well. One standout was the Al Duca Italian restaurant just around the corner from the hotel. The food was great and it provided a true contemporary Italian experience right in the heart of London.The Cavendish is very conveniently located just 3 blocks from Piccadilly Circus, but far enough away that you can avoid the Piccadilly noise and crowds. It is within easy walking distance to Trafalger Square and Buckingham palace.In typical London style, the rooms are small but very comfortable. The quality of the materials used in the rooms was top notch and very elegant.My one complaint was the lack of reasonably price internet service. While you can get free wireless service in the lobby, if you want service in your room you will pay 20 pounds daily for the privilege, at the current exchange rate that is $32. In room service was wired only which doesn't help if you're using an iPhone or iPod touch. We just wanted to be able to plan our sightseeing days and having to do it in the lobby was very inconvenient.If you can live with the internet service issue then I would highly recommend the Cavendish."
42,1200,"Jul 17 2009 	Great job Cavendish!	The Cavendish is wonderful hotel. Its stylish, clean, comfortable and you will be treated like a dignified guest staying in a luxury boutique hotel in the posh part of town. So many hotels in London are overpriced, dank and feel like your grandmothers outdated parlor. This isnt one of them. Other reviews cover the basics, so here is the important stuff. We stayed in a superior twin room, and didnt think it was small. Two girls, two large suitcases, and lots of stuff all fit. Bathrooms are well lit and modern. Water pressure is great. Linens are new. Beds are very comfortable. Black out curtains for sleeping in. Good sized televisions with plenty of channels. We got a great advanced rate that included breakfast and VAT. The hotel was actually nicer than we anticipated given the relatively small price difference between the Cavendish and 3 star hotels in London. (As an aside, I visited friends staying at the more expensive Holiday Inn Mayfair, just 2 blocks awayits dumpy, dark, smellythis is a much better hotel. Think W Hotel vs. well, Holiday Inn). Aside from the comfortable accommodations, what we liked most was the location and the service. The location really cant be beat. We were able to walk to just about everythingGreen Park tube station is around the corner, as is Piccadilly Circus; parks; museums; major tourist attractions; shopping and the Thames River. Two years ago I stayed at the Darlington Hyde Park and much, much, much preferred this part of the cityattractions, dining, shopping are all more accessible and better quality as this is one of the best neighborhoods. The staff is extremely accommodating and polite. They delivered ice, juices and made cheese sandwiches especially for us in the early hours of the morning. They also didnt freak out when friends visited late at night for drinks and were less than quiet. Very professional. Breakfast is great, especially if its included in the price of your stay. Eggs are made to order; coffee is delivered to your table; everything is fresh and you can take a plate up to the room for later. They will also deliver breakfast if you order it the night before. This hotel delivers quality and a little luxory at a reasonable price. Overall great. I intend to stay here from now on."
43,1200,"Jul 16 2009 	The Cavendish - what a great place!!	Hi there,I've just returned home from a great stay at The Cavendish - I found everything about the hotel to be fantastic, in fact, I haven't one complaint! I noticed in previous reviews that some people said the rooms were small and I admit mine wasn't huge but in a city like London you don't spend much time in your hotel or I don't...I'm always too busy exploring!! The location of the hotel is second to none...I barely had to get the tube it was that central (always a bonus in the Summer as the tube gets very hot!) But on days when I did, both Green Park and Piccadilly Circus were within 5 minutes walking distance.And the breakfast buffet is good here too - lots to choose from from bacon &amp; eggs, cheese, ham, cereal, fruit etc.So, all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel"
44,1200,"Jul 14 2009 	Great Location beautiful room super views	We stayed at the Cavendish for one night following a cruise. I had booked an executive room, but when we arrived they said for 30 pounds more we could have the penthouse with terrace. We said ok and it was truly worth it. The penthouse is very large, on the 15th (top floor) with stairs up to the floor from the 14th floor elevator. The living room had two sliding doors with a large terrace that overlooked London and had a wonderful view of the Eye, Big Ben, Parliament, St. Pauls, the pickle and Westminster.The bed was king sized and very comfortable. The bathroom was large with separate shower and bath and eco-green bath amenities. The only thing I could quibble with is that they only left two towels total. It was our anniversary celebration and the staff sent up a delicious chocolate cake!We had to leave for the Heathrow Express at 6:10 am and breakfast which was included didn't start until 6:30 am. However, the staff prepared a beautiful breakfast tray of fruit bowl, croissants, juice and coffee for us in our room. It was wonderful!We would stay here again anytime we are in London. The location, near Piccadilly on Jermyn Street is fabulous."
45,1200,"Jul 13 2009 	Be aware of the cancellation policy	My husband has stayed at this hotel many times on business mainly for its central location. I booked it today for tomorrow through our regular booking site hotels london and realised as soon as I read the confirmation that I had booked for today by accident. I immediately emailed the booking agent who called the hotel straightaway. They advised that tomorrow is full, although their website is still showing rooms available and that they can do nothing but cancel the booking and retain all the payment. Their website's reservation page says &quot;check or modify a booking&quot; and I can't find where their cancellation regulations are laid out either so he will not be staying here again, just thought others should be aware not to let their finger slip."
46,1200,"Jul 8 2009 	Stylish compact hotel in a perfect location	I'd bought DH tickets to see Kings of Leon at the O2 for Christmas. After some searching, we decided to go for the Cavendish based on the good reviews on TA, central location and reasonable price (got an early booking discount direct on their website).Was really easy to get to from Euston, even with the Victoria line out of action - just one change. It's about a 10-15 min walk from Green Park with our luggage, about 5-10 without. The hotel doesn't have a massive facade like some others do so not easy to spot immediately -but you can easily spot it because it is directly opposite Fortnum and Mason's.Check-in service was excellent. I'd requested a high-floor room when I booked on the website but because one wasn't available at that time, we were given a complimentary upgrade. Bonus! We were also given some vouchers to use at the bar at for the pre-theatre dinner menu at the restaurant.When we got to our room, our first impression was that it was very stylish BUT it was very small - if that was an upgrade, wonder what a standard room size was?! However, there was everything you needed - hairdryer, iron, big flatscreen TV. The bathroom was equally compact but not cramped. Really nice range of toiletries too. Am assuming that the small size of the room is a reflection of the age of the building and that it may have had a previous life as an office, something other than a hotel anyway!One thing that is clear with the Cavendish is that they are very green - impressively so. The toiletries were in recyclable plastic sachets which significantly reduces waste. There was no hotel brochure - all information was available through the TV, reducing paper usage. Everything that could be reduced, reused or recycled was reduced, reused or recycled! Really encouraging to see that this kind of green thinking is possible in a fairly big hotel.The breakfast was delicious - really wide choice of good quality local food. Staff were pleasant and efficient. And even better for us bedheads, they serve right up to midday at the weekend!The bar is really stylish but quite small. Really nice selection of spirits and table service too. However, it is popular with business types - lots of power lunches going on! And fair enough - would rather hold a meeting there than in a pokey office....but it's not fun for other patrons, felt we had to speak with lowered voices so as not to disturb them!To top off the trendy styling and friendly service, the hotel is in a FAB location. As I said, right opposite Fortnum and Mason's, a few minutes' walk from Picadilly and Regent Street. And if you're going to the O2, it's only 15 mins direct on the Tube (think it's the Jubilee line).I loved this hotel and I'm sure we will use it our base for any future trips to London."
47,1200,"Jul 8 2009 	READ THE RIGHT REVIEW (iam a pillock)	The wife &amp; i have been wanting to stay at the Cavendish Hotel on JERMYN STREET, for ages and as a birthday treat the wife booked for us to stay for the weekend and to go and watch Oliver as i love Oliver. When she told me this only about a week from when we due to go as it was a surprise but she had to tell me as i was thinking of planning somthing else, so i check out as i always do the hotel. So i put in Cavendish Hotel London and having read the reviews could not believe the reviews as i new this was avery nice hotel and was a bit miffed at the reviews.So now i am back home and ready to wright my review and tell everybody that this is a very nice hotel and can't understand why people thought it was rubbish, only to find that i was looking at a same name hotel but on Gower Street, and not on Jermyn Street, yes i am a pillock. So let me just say that the hotel was very nice the food very good, and very well situated walking distance to most of the sight's. the room and bathroom were on the small side but very nice (superior room) and all the ammenities you require,and would definetly stay here again. there were no problems. Quick tip never mind the Londoe eye we thought it was a waste of money, go to the 14 floor out of lift turn right and at the end of the corrider you will see most of what you see from the eye."
48,1200,"Jul 7 2009 	Good position not great hotel	the hotel is very central, but yet not too central to make it a problem. we upgraded our room glad we did because the room we got was very small. Staff at reception were very good, staff at bar were excellent, staff at dinner and breakfast not so good. we had early dinner before our show (Waiting for Godot) and that was not good at all, the dinner not the show, very limited options and not so good on the staff side either. if you need somewhere in the middle of London and price is an issue, then stay here, if you want a good or great hotel then don't."
49,1200,"Jul 6 2009 	The Cavendish is Fabulous	The Cavenish is a fantastic hotel. It was an excellent choice. We upgraded to an Executive room. Our room was fantastic .... very clean, very spacious and with an outstanding view of the London Eye. The bathroom was amazing. The plumbing was Villoy and Boche. It was the best hotle bathroom I have ever seen .... heated towel racks, huge shower, long deep tub and Villoy and Boche fixtures. It doesn't get any better. The staff was very friendly and most helpful. Thankfully breakfast was included in our rate. It was excellent but IMHO, over priced at 21 pounds each (few breakfasts are worth that much to me). Overall an excellent stay in a wonderful hotel. It will be my 1st choice in London. The location is outstanding. It is close to Piccadilly and the West End theatres but ison a quiet street."
50,1200,"Jul 5 2009 	A Great Base	This was our second stay here and again it was faultless.We stayed just for 1 night for the Hard Rock Calling festival at nearby Hyde Park.The check in was efficient and the room we had , an executive room on the top floor, was really nice with great views of the london skyline and also very very clean.One massive bonus for this hotel is the breakfast,I think it is the best breakfast you can have at a hotel in London and its included in the room rate.The location is brilliant(just behind Fortnum and Mason) so all in all a winner"
51,1200,"Jul 5 2009 	Lovely hotel	We went to London with some familymembers. I had asked for 2 rooms on the same floor and got it too. We got to the hotel before the check-in time. A lovely lady at the reception made it possible for one room to be ready in an half hour. So we could all store our luggage and relax. The concierge gave us directions and maps. In the lobby there is free internet. The rooms are very small, but nice and clean. The view is great."
52,1200,"Jun 29 2009 	Great Location	Stayed for 4 nights in a Superior room - found the room quite small, but it's clean and is in a quiet but central location (Fortnum and Mason's right across, Piccadilly Circus a mere 3-minute walk). I expected free WIFI, but it was only free in the lobby and I had to pay loads to connect in my room. Staff's helpful yet discreet. They even let me leave my luggage for 5 days even when I wasn't coming back to their hotel afterwards. Breakfast was pricey so I ended up choosing from the various cafes nearby - try the Patisserie Valerie in Piccadilly, close to Ritz."
53,1200,"Jun 28 2009 	Lovely small hotel with friendly staff	The hotel has a great location, minutes walking from green park, piccadilly circus and so on. The rooms are very clean, newly renovated but not very spacious. Breakfast was LOVELY. Staying at the Cavendish was a very good choice."
54,1200,"Jun 26 2009 	Wonderful Hotel	I loved my stay at the Cavendish. The rooms are modern, well appointed, comfortable, clean and nice and bright. Not your traditional dank and musty London hotel room. Wonderfully big, double paned windows that really keep the street noise at bay. Stayed here for 13 nights and loved every minute. Concierge was wonderful, had fabulous room service breakfast every morning which was included in the price of my room. I felt pampered from head to toe. Food and service in the hotel restaurant was A++ and the hotel lobby bar was a great place to relax and catch afternoon tea or a cocktail in the evening. Great location in the heart of the best of what London has to offer yet still enough off the beaten path that you get a quaint neighborhood feel. I stayed here alone and the neighborhood was safe for me to walk alone at night. I highly recommend this hotel."
55,1200,"Jun 25 2009	Never want to stay anywhere but the Cavendish-	What can I say...Everything is great at the Cavendish..My mother and I stayed here for 8 nights and it was our return to the Cavendish...The executive room was spacious, comfy and very well tended to by housekeeping..we even got new mattresses during our stay..that was a first.The morning breakfast, included in our room rate, is an endless buffet with the option to order off a menu as well. Luis was genuinely kind and made sure we were completely happy whenever we were in his sight. What more can a traveller ask for?Since many restaurants are closed on Sundays, we ate in David Britten's hotel restaurant Easter Sunday. One of the best meals of my life...the presentation was a work of art . A sublime amuse bouche was served- a deconstructed stuffed mushroom on brioche. The service by Martin was thoughtful, engaging and, in the Cavendish way, straightforwardly elegant. Springtime cream of celeriac soup was enjoyed via room service, beautifully served in elegance and in less than 15 minutes from the time we ordered.Ben, the head concierge, is very accomplished, warm, generous with his assistance and was so helpful on both our trips in 2007 and 2009.We hope the day never comes when the Cavendish is anything less than a fantastic luxury hotel with a great staff and elegant hospitality"
56,1200,"Jun 23 2009 	Modern clean and comfortable boutique hotel in a great location	I had read all of the reviews prior to my trip and I must say that this hotel definitely deserves all of the positive feedback. The primary reason for my trip was for business during the week. I stayed in Windsor during the week and then moved to central London along with my husband who joined me for the weekend. We are both in our early 30s - no kids, yet! The location is perfect. It is easy to get to and from the airport. The Tube will take you right to Green Park or Picadilly Circus - both about a 5 minute walk to the hotel. It is a little cumbersome with luggage, but this was by far the most cost-efficient mode of transportation. When we arrived at the hotel, it looked exactly as it had in the pictures, which is always a good thing! The woman at reception was very nice. I had requested a room away from the lift and on an upper floor. Both of these requests were honored. We had booked a Superior Room (upon recommendation from a friend who had stayed here). I highly recommend a Superior Room (minimally). I can't imagine the size of the Classic Room b/c the Superior Room was tiny. However, it was exactly what I was expecting. And, as many other reviewers have mentioned, how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room? Plus, it was modern and super clean. The bathroom was actually big relative to the size of the room. And the bed was super comfy! It is a little difficult to find places for 2 suitcases, but we managed just fine. The room was actually quite cozy - in a good way. Although the hotel was fully booked while we were there, we did not hear any TV, voices, etc... coming from any of the rooms or hallway. Our rate included breakfast so we took advantage of that every morning. It was a buffet that offered everything imaginable from the traditional English breakfast to cereal, yogurt, and fruit. Although it was really good, I don't think we would have eaten here if it wasn't included in our rate. It cost 21 pounds a person! I think that is a bit excessive - even by London standards! Speaking of excessive...the charge for Internet access is crazy. I think it was 20 pounds for 24 hours. I travel quite a bit (albeit mostly in the US) and free wireless is pretty much becoming the standard. Anyway, there is a way around this. If you go to reception, they will give you a code for a free 15 minutes on the lobby computers. This was perfect for doing a quick search for a restaurant, checking in for our flight, and checking Facebook :-) Back to the location...it really is perfect. I had only been to London once before so I was not familiar with my surroundings besides what I knew from a map. I can say that most major tourist attractions are within walking distance. We even walked to the Tower of London, which I don't recommend. It's not that it was a bad walk, but it did take over an hour so you just need to plan your day accordingly. In addition to a lot of the tourist attractions, there are also a ton of places to eat within close walking distance. If you are looking for inexpensive, there is an EAT, Costa Coffee and Pret a Manger on almost every street. And, if you want something more upscale, there are plenty of options in Soho, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. And, of course, tons of pubs if you are looking for some ale and Fish &amp; Chips. If you are looking for clothing shopping, I would recommend Oxford St. It has all the big (reasonably priced) fashionable stores like Next, H&amp;M, Topshop,etc... This is also where the big toy store &quot;Hamleys&quot; is located. If you want to go to the theater, I would recommend checking out the half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square. It's only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. I know a lot of this information is not directly related to the hotel. However, I think the &quot;stuff&quot; around the hotel is almost as important as the hotel itself. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others. I have a couple of very, very minor negatives. One, is the key. It is really cool, but my husband had it in his back pocket and must have sat on it weird. So, it stopped working and we got locked out of the room. This can easily be avoided. My other negative is the lack of exercise room. I work out 4 times a week and I was really missing my work-outs. However, I think I more than made up for it with all of the walking! Lastly, if you are travelling with children, I would book the next room level up. The Superior Room would be much too small for more than 2 people.As a side note, I would highly recommend a day trip to Windsor. It is lovely and the tour of the Castle is worh the money. There is a train from Waterloo to Windsor. It's about a 45 minute ride. I think it cost around 10 pounds."
57,1200,"Jun 16 2009 	lovely hotel	Husband and I stayed three nights in a junior suite, visiting London for the first time in 18 years.My first impression of the room was a little disappointing, it looked smallish for a JS and a little cramped. I must say the room, and the hotel, grew on us. Though not as glamorous or luxurious as could be expected from a four star, the hotel proved to be a haven in an incredible hectic city which suffered from a tube strike, followed by tube repairs on half of the network. The hotel has two major things going for it: first the excellent location from where we could walk almost everywhere, and second the wonderful staff, which proved enthousiastic, professional, friendly and helpfull.The room had in fact everything that's important: a comfortable king bed, a clean bath, a good TV. We experienced some noise from the elevators, but we got used to it and it did not hinder our sleep. Nevertheless, next time we will ask for a room a little farther from the lifts. And a next time hopefully there will be, because we don't want to wait another 18 years to visit this wonderful city, and we would be happy to stay at the Cavendish again."
58,1200,"Jun 15 2009 	Excellent.	Spent three nights at the Cavendish in between time in the Lake District and returning home to Canada. I've was traditionally a guest in Marylebone or Bloomsbury hotels until I decided to give this place a shot.This is an excellent hotel, superbly furnished and made up, with a first for me in London: A VIEW OVER THE CITY (in my case, back towards the old BT Tower). Wonderful bed, clean bathroom, great room service breakfasts. Location can't be beat, a noise eliminating distance from Piccadilly Circus and its Tube connections, and within easy walking distance of Soho, Knightsbridge, Green Park, Buckingham Palace - well, actually, a good chunk of the West End. Jermyn Street is home to a number of haberdashers and not far from the tailors of Savile Row. There's a Tesco's and cinema at the Circus end of the street and a good collection of pubs sprinkled in the St. James's streets below Piccadilly."
59,1200,Jun 10 2009 	What a jewel!	Great property in a great location! The rooms were a bit smaller than in U.S. hotels but the amenities made up for the size. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The food was very good and we really enjoyed the bar although the drinks are a bit pricey. I highly recommend this hotel and hopefully will be able to return!
60,1200,May 29 2009 	Stayed Second Time!	The hotel staff is very friendly. Rooms are excellent and for London relative big. The hotel is perfectly located at Jermyn Street which is close to Downtown. I highly recommend the hotel. We are going to stay there again if we go to London.
61,1200,"May 24 2009 	Wonderful hotel at a wonderful location	The Cavendish was an excellent choice for our 8 night London vacation. The staff was always helpful and friendly. While the rooms are small by American standards ours was large enough for comfort. Our 10th floor room overlooked the rooftop bee hives at Fortum and Mason gourmet food store. The room and bath were very clean and were kept clean during our entire stay. Though not an issue for us, the tub was rather high sided so elderly or handicapped guests might have a problem getting in or out. We enjoyed the ground floor bar on several occasions when we did not feel like going out to a pub. The Cavendish is at an excellent location for London sightseeing. It is located midway between Green Park and Piccadilly stations on the underground. You can get there without changing underground lines direct from LHR. It is one block off of Piccadilly Street so it is quiet at night. The area is surrounded by good restaurants and is in easy walking distance of Leicester Square, theaters and the National Gallery. Our only issue with the Cavendish is the high cost of the breakfast buffet. While it is a lovely buffet, at 21BP ($35 plus service charge per person!!!) it is way overpriced. We quickly abandoned breakfast at the hotel for one of the numerous coffee shops in the area. Overall, if you avoid the buffet this is an outstanding hotel in a great location."
62,1200,"May 13 2009 	Fantastic!	We stayed one night at the Cavendish rather than shlep back to Reading after going to the theatre. All I can say is wow! OK. maybe I'm not used to staying somewhere above a Holiday Express but this place was great. Terrific concierge (can't remember his name - he was an Aussie or Kiwi - those guys know about service) and friendly, attentive staff. When we checked in we had our prebooked superior room upgraded to a deluxe due to &quot;room availability&quot; - a real treat. The room was gorgeous with its own little lounge area and beautifully fitted out bathroom. The translucent door didn't bother us but you couldn't see in anyway. There were bathrobes, slippers, BeeKind toiletries, a wallmounted CD system (you can borrow CDs from the hotel) and two huge flatscreen TVs. The bed has to be one of the most comfortable we've ever slept in - it was a struggle to get up the next morning! Can't fault the room at all.Always make a point not to touch the mini-bar but ordered a sandwich from room service which was very nice. One tiny quibble - the top slice of bread was slightly dry as if it had been waiting under a heat lamp but that's being very picky. The inclusive breakfast was superb - if you couldn't find something you didn't like from the vast hot and cold buffet then you would be a very picky eater indeed! Some may like the hot food a little hotter but again that's being very picky.I would recommend this hotel to anyone - we'd definitely stay there again for a special occasion."
63,1200,"May 13 2009 	Perfect!	I took my girlfriend away to London for a romantic weekend and chose the Cavendish after hearing good things from a friend and we were not disappointed. Its smack in the middle of the west end, (got to see the musical chicago and then stroll back to hotel for after show drinks), The staff could not have done more for us, I rang a week ahead and the concierge booked theatre tickets for me which were ready when i checked in. We ate in the restaurant on the night of our arrival and it was exactly what we wanted, the food was out of this world but at reasonable price, the waiters were attentive but not pushy. Our room was large and comfortable, spotlessly clean and decorated with a nice subdued elegance. Next time I visit London I will make sure I stay at the Cavendish. It has a great location, superb rooms and friendly staff. I absolutely recommend."
64,1200,"Apr 28 2009 	Fantastic hotel staff and location	My wife and I have just returned from a weekend stay at the Cavendish. We were in London as I was running in the London Marathon on the Sunday and needed a comfortable stay for the weekend. I really couldnt have chosen better! Were do I start? Well the location is superb, just around the corner from Green Park Underground, across the road is Fortnums and the Royal Academy of Arts. Piccadilly Circus is 5 minutes walk and Trafalgar Square another 5. The Ritz Hotel, perfect for afternoon tea, (but book well in advance), is literally around the corner. Importantly for me was that the finish of the marathon is in St James Park which is right behind Green Park Underground Station, well within hobbling distance! The staff are very friendly, helpful and highly efficient. The breakfast is excellent, with just about the widest choice we have ever seen at a hotel. Our only gripe, and we are nit picking here, was the size of the room. It was a little on the small size but adequate and we did get an excellent deal so a little churlish to complain. In all, if you are looking for a really good hotel in the very centre of London at a more than reasonable price then look no further, highly recommended!"
65,1200,"Apr 27 2009 	FANTASTIC!!! PERFECT HOTEL! BOOK AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!	This hotel is beautiful!!!!! the location is perfect walking sitance from everywhere!!!

66,1200,"Apr 19 2009 	Brillant A****************************	We stayed at the Cavendish hotel last year, had a great deal on the room so was really looking forward going. Once we got there our room was not ready so had to wait half an hour but the staff was so nice they upgraded our room which had the most amazing view.The room was bright,warm and so clean, the breakfast was top class so much selection and it was in with the price of the room.The location was exactly where we expected only 10 mins walk from new bond st and oxford st and Picadily circus was just 10 mins away too so we didnt even use the underground as everything was in walikng distance.We are returning again in september this year and as a returning customer had a great deal so would highly recomend this hotel."
67,1200,"Apr 8 2009 	We stay here everytime we are in London	Rooms are small but probably standard for London. Despite snug quarters, very nicely appointed (modern decor), pleasant bathroom, spotlessly clean, well maintained and up to date hotel. Located right across from Fortnum and Mason, in a very convenient location for tourism and shopping. Fair pricing for this expensive city, also offers a &quot;weekend special&quot; including breakfast if you are willing to pay in advance as it is non-changable non-refundable. We booked this arrangement, and loved our excellent breakfast in the room which arrived right on time, although slightly less hot than it could have been.Only complaint is that the duvet on the bed is so thick that it was very hot under the covers despite setting a cold temp on the thermostat. Had an uneven sleep as a result.Nice lounge on second floor, busy lobby bar at cocktail hour."
68,1200,"Apr 5 2009 	What an absolute gem!	Stayed here for one night for a theatre break. Fantastic location. Superb standards of service and cleanliness.It was my husband's birthday, and they even provided us with a complimentary chocolate birthday cake.I would recommend this hotel time and time again for anyone wanting to be central and in a very good standard of accommodation.Brilliant hotel!!"
69,1200,"Apr 2 2009 	Back again	We stayed here exactly a year ago to the day. We like to try to stay at different places, but in the end we decided why change when we enjoyed it so much last time. This time we took our 6 year old along. Booked an executive room for 3 and we didn't pay for an extra bed as the bed is so big that it was OK for 3 (room 812). To our surprise and gratitude we got a room with a sofa bed already made up for our son along with colouring books and crayons and dressing gown. This was very thoughtful touch.Bed was extremely comfortable, clean and spacious bathroom and good coffee and tea making facilities. I love the small extras: bottle water by the bedside, magazines in room.Staff and facilities were still just as good as ever: one of the staff at breakfast recognised us from last year. We ended up booking the room with breakfast option but from my last review we didn't think much of breakfast but it was cheaper to book this option than to go for room only! However, we did decide one day to skip breakfast and go to Fortnum and Mason's for breakfast. The full on option was 19 GBP and the hotel charge 21 GBP. The quality of food in Fortnum and Mason's was well above the Cavendish although service wasn't. Fully recommend trying the breakfast there especially the pancakes, bacon and sausages.Only downside was the noise insulation could be better. We only discovered this on Sunday morning when we got woken up by next door talking, TV swiched on and talking on the phone. It wasn't as if they were noisy but it felt like there was no wall there but just a partition.However still fully recommend this hotel and we are thinking of making this an annual visit."
70,1200,"Apr 1 2009 	A wonderful hotel for a theatre week	The Cavendish London81 Jermyn Street, London, England, United KingdomThe Cavendish London at 81 Jermyn Street is an ideal hotel to stay in. The location is on a quiet street, parallel to Piccadilly, right behind the famous Fortnum Mason upscale department store; yet it is within walking distance of most theatres. It is immaculate; the personnel are professional, welcoming, gracious; the service is impeccable. The buffet breakfast of hot and cold choices is amazing. I booked a superior twin bedroom which was well furnished and comfortable, perhaps a little small for 2 people. Although the bathroom is large enough, it lacks ample shelf space for toiletries, especially for 2 people, but perhaps this will be corrected. If you have your own laptop, connection is free in the lobby and in the lounge. If not, they will give you 15 minutes complimentary time on one of 2 computers in the lobby.I would like to add that for a reasonable and comfortable transfer from/to Heathrow directly to/from your hotel, I highly recommend a company called dot2dot Their website: dot2.com"
71,1200,"Mar 28 2009 	Great location and very good service	Myself and 3 friends stayed here on 21st March for 1 night and we were all impressed with the room and service. Eventhough we arrived at the hotel b4 check in @ 2pm the concierge very kindly held our luggage for us so we went to do some shopping!! We stayed on the 12th floor and the view was amazing!!! The room was very clean &amp; tidy and the tea trolley was stocked up with a variety of teas and coffee plus shortbread biccies!! We enjoyed our night out in London and were ready for a full cooked breakfast in the morning which was self service and very tasty. As an agent for a holiday company I had received a discount but would of paid full price for the location, breakfast and view from our room. Would stay there again!!!"
72,1200,"Mar 27 2009 	Fab location excellent service	We just returned from spending 4 nights at The Cavendish and had a great time. The staff was fantastic, very helpful and very friendly. The location is brilliant, hard to beat. We chose to upgrade our room upon arrival. The room was a good size and very comfortable. We would definitely stay at The Cavenish again."
73,1200,"Mar 26 2009 	Superb Location	We stayed at The Cavendish in November 2008, and consider staying there every time we go back to London. The Cavendish, very centrally located within walking distance to Picadilly Circus was a very comfortable, very clean, modern hotel with excellent service and rooms and good food. And of course it was real value for money."
74,1200,"Mar 25 2009 	Would stay again.	We have stayed at many hotels from Ritz's to family &quot;travel&quot; soccer hotels, so we did a lot of research before booking this hotel. We were surprised it was not mentioned in a lot of the major guidebooks, but liked the location and price. Booked two rooms for myself and daughters. It was a great place to stay. Rooms European (small) size, but a well thought out contemporary with flat screen tv. The beds were extremely comfortable and rooms spotlessly clean. Location was fantastic. Thanks to all housekeeping, as well as Mariko, Nick, Carl, Kaesar, Breakfast servers, and Elliot."
75,1200,"Mar 23 2009 	Fantastic! What a great hotel!	I was VERY impressed by this hotel. Not only were we greeted at the door, our bags taken off us, checked in immediately and given a complimentary upgrade! We were also offered dinner and had a table booked straight away. The rooms were gorgeous, really stylish, with CD players (great for if you are going to a concert or musical!) flat screen TV's, lovely tea and coffee, fabulous showers and The White Company toiletries, beds were extremely comfortable and duvets soft! I just cant fault the location and value for money - I really think this hotel is a cut above! I will stay here every time I am in London now, no more lottery in terms of hotel choice - this is the one!!!"
76,1200,"Mar 20 2009 	Excellent Service	We would most definitely stay at the Cavendish again. We had a great rate, and you cant beat the location as it is within walking distance of so many popular sites. It is also a short walk from two tube stations and many busses on Piccadilly. A small Tesco grocery is 3 short blocks away. We asked in advance for early check in and were checked in promptly when we arrived at 11 AM. Our room (914) had a great view, was spotlessly clean, and easy to keep cool. The comfortable bed had a sheet-enclosed duvet and four bed pillows. The TV had great reception, with lots of channels. The bathroom was equipped with a heated towel rack and plenty of towels and soaps/conditioner. We never heard noise from any other room. Occasionally, we would hear someone roll luggage down the hall, but that was rare and during the daynot at night. Our room was just a short ways down from the elevator, but we never heard them. The concierge desk was always staffed with at least one person, and often two, and these staff members were so friendly and always seemed eager to get the information we needed. I even asked one to print out a coupon for me, and he never hesitated, even though the form required him to fill out some information for me. He did not make me feel like I was bothering him, but instead, he acted like this was an important thing he was doing for me. The reception staff also was helpful, and we had no problems with our bill.Luis set the high standard for graciousness and hospitality in the breakfast room. His smiling face and warm welcome greeted us each morning, making us feel as though we were his special guests. We were early risers, and Luis always found a table for us next to a window, instead of seating us in the middle of the room, even though we never asked for one of those special tables, and breakfast was included in our rate. Every server we had during each of the four mornings we visited the breakfast room smiled, made good eye contact with each of us, gave us their full attention, and immediately took care of any special requests we had, even if it was just for more sweetener or an extra tea bag. The wonderful breakfast included a buffet filled with luscious fresh fruit (I never saw any canned fruit), an appealing variety of breads and rolls, yogurt, smoked fish, sliced ham, salami, and cheeses. (One of the mornings, they also had a hot buffet.) At the table, one could also order a full English breakfast, or choose from a variety of breakfasts, which included meats, eggs, and usually hashbrown potatoes. I asked for the bacon to be cooked a certain way and was always accommodated. My husband had eggs prepared in different ways during our stay, and he was thrilled with how perfectly they were cooked and their flavor. We never felt rushed to finish our meal and vacate our table. Our servers removed the used dishes as we finished with them and asked if they could bring us anything else. Always when we finished breakfast and were leaving, every staff member we passed in the breakfast room noticed our departure, smiled, thanked us, and told us to enjoy our day. Luis also said goodbye each morning and often addressed us by name. We could not ask for better or friendlier service."
77,1200,"Mar 17 2009 	Tiny room great location	I stayed at the hotel while I was house-hunting in the area. The location was fantastic and the room was in good condition, very clean although it was tiny (802 ) - i couldn't even fit my suitcase in the wardrobe. The concierge staff were brilliant. I did try and stay an extra night except when I went to reception to do this I was told that because I had booked the first four nights online I had to book online and there was no way I could just book and pay for it there and then. So I went online and found a better deal elsewhere. I had booked through hotels.com who stated there was a gym in the hotel - which there isn't. The fire alarm went off twice while I was there and after walking down 8 flights of stairs I was told it was only a drill."
78,1200,"Mar 16 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location and Price	Originally over on business so made a weekend of it with my husband. Could not have chosen a better hotel and would most certainly stay there again. Standard rooms are a little on the small side but as you don't spend too much time in them it doesn't matter. Ask for a room on a high floor as the view is great - London Eye, St Paul's etc. It a 2 min walk from Piccadilly Circus and 10 from Covent Garden. Plus walking distance to Regent Street and Oxford Street.Great breakfast to set you up for all the sightseeing/shopping etc. Highly recommend this hotel."
79,1200,"Mar 15 2009 	Location Location Location	This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and reason being it is right in the middle of London. Close to Mayfair, St James, Regent Street etc etc etc. The rooms are pretty small but have everything you need and are very clean and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London who wants a central base. We paid extra for breakfast and enjoyed what we had and felt at 10 each we probably could not have got much better elsewhere."
80,1200,"Mar 7 2009 	Superb Hotel	We had booked The Cavendish on recommendations of our friends and we definitely were not disapointed ! We were given a friendly and professional check in , luckily on reading other reviews we chose to upgrade myself to a Superior room which had amazing views to London Eye and Big Ben and the location was perfect- in central London . Room was spotless and dinner service was great. The only small quibble we had was that the bathroom door is semi transparent - can be a little embarrasing for some people. Over all a great hotel . we will definitely choose it for our next stay"
81,1200,"Feb 27 2009 	Excellent hotel great location spectacular views	We stayed here for a honeymoon in August, and after calling ahead to tell them we were honeymooning and we given a room on the top floor, in the far corner, away from everyone but the persons using the penthouse. The views across London from the windows were fantastic. The quality of the room was superb, warm, clean and very stylish. Location-wise, you are no more than 2 minutes walk from a major tube station and Piccadilly Circus. Almost all major landmarks are within easy walking distance. The breakfast was lovely too.The only strange thing with our room was the see-through door to the toilet... it was kind of weird sitting on the loo with your new wife being able to watch... not that she did!"
82,1200,Feb 18 2009 	Great  quiet location but rooms very small	Stayed 1 night on business. Location really good and Jermyn Street itself is very quiet for such a centrally located address. Reception and public rooms are also quiet. Bedrooms have been tastefully refurbished very recently but a very small. Fine for 1 or 2 nights but not to appealing for any stay longer than that.I booked through Laterooms.com and got good rate a few weeks in advance but the price rose fairly quickly as it got nearer the arrival date.Would definately return but as said earlier not for a lenghty stay.
83,1200,"Feb 17 2009 	Convenient and clean but not cheap	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights over valentine's to enjoy the week end a westend show. We got a good deal through an internet site (420 for 2 nights including breakfast and 2 very good tickets for Mama Mia on the valentine's evening).The location is just fantastic. Less the 8 min walk from piccadilly station (about 10 min from green park station), easily walkable distance to many West End show in the area. It's also a street away from the main street providing a some protection from the busy london city. It is also next to Fortnum and Mason if you are a bit of foodie with money to brun (we only managed to buy a tin of earl grey there!). There are plenty of restaurants and cafes which is nice too.The reception was clean but not to my taste - use of purplish pink and neon like lighting screams cheap to me but I suppose this is matter of opinion. Checking in and out was quick and hussle free, and professionally done. 3 elevators were more then adequate for the hotel and we never had to que for this. We only used concerge service to hold our bags (which they did without any problem) so we cant comment.The room itself is ok - we opted for superior room which was clean with comfortable bed and well decorated room (well almost. I've noticed a couple of wall papers were peeling a little). It also had a good LCD tv with good picture. I'll have to say the room was a bit small - just about enough for all the furniture in there and I know London hotels are notorious for there room size but at this price I would have expected a ittle better. The mini bar was so expensive I was tempted to put the whole thing in the room's safe. Word of warning: dont do what I did and remove the content from the fridge (no i didn't put it in the safe, just put my own drink from outside to chill it) as it is connected to the sensor which automatically adds the content to your bill. Thankfully the hotel accepted my explanation and deducted the bill (well for now). Sound proofing was ok - we didn't hear the neighbours in our room but could hear their tv when walking in the corridoor.The bathroom on the other hand was ridiculously huge compared to the room. Its a fake mable slate affaire with fashinoable stand out sink which worked well. Together with excellent freebie showergel/shampoo and heated towel railing it was a nice bathrrom. The shower's power was a bit weak though.The breakfast was very disappointing. Food was average at best and selection limited. I had far far better breakfast in Portugal or Lake district. Service was disappoing too. Although the do cooked breakfast as part of the buffet (e.g. poached egg) at request they hid this service from us, and many other guests. The waiteress there also seemed to have their favourite customers and often proceeded to ignore the other guests. We were also asked to &quot;sign this&quot; (a bill with 21 written on it) without explanation of what it was, and despite breakfast being included in our stay! When I explained our deal the waiter gave no apology and his manager, standing couple of feet away, also decided to ignore this. Suffice to say we did not eat at their restaurant (although they boasts AA 2 rossets).Will we return? Yes, we'd love to if we can afford it. But bear in mind you pay for location, location and location!"
84,1200,"Jan 16 2009 	very nice place	I like the Cavendish, it is a very well kept, friendly hotel in an excellent location with good value. Rooms are very nice and reasonably sized, very clean. Service is excellent. The lounge area in the first floor is a very nice place to chat with friends.I can recommend it. The only minor complaint is, that you have to pay for Internet in your room."
85,1200,"Jan 4 2009 	good location	My husband and I stayed on a pre Xmas shopping and theatre break. We wanted a good location for both and this hotel is great for both. We stayed in room 1013 which wasn't noisy and although quite compact was clean although I thought they weren't very generous with the complimentory toiletries etc given that we were there for 5 nights!I agree with some of the other comments about rates - we booked online at their special online rate for advanced booking - thinking we were getting a good rate - but when we arrived they'd just charged us the full usual rate for bed &amp; breakfast! Our fault really for not checking.There were queues for breakfast at weekendwhich they warn you about but given the size of the hotel I thought they'd have sorted that issue out somehow. The service on weekdays was poor, but fine at the weekend."
86,1200,"Jan 3 2009 	Great Location Friiendly and Professional Staff	Stayed on the 9th floor for 4 nights. Very good location and the bed was comfortable. Nice view of London if you prefer to spend time looking out the window. As far as hotel rooms in London, it would probably rank higher than the trip advisor # 45 rating. The bathroom was adequate with a nice enough tub. The mini bar tended to lean towards booze with a couple of pringle tins and some wasabi nuts on offer. If the carpet in the room had been replaced (it was decidely scruffy and needed to go) I would have ranked the hotel higher but I tend to fixate on such thing as well as the strange photo/artwork on the walls (why is there a picture of a woman in a cocktail dress and hat from the 30s hanging there and a man jumping across a puddle?....is this supposed to be 'contemporary English/British?' I found it odd and almost creepy.) The staff was excellent, well trained and professional. It is true that you can hear people talking in other rooms but this isn't so suprising for a European/British hotel considering the constraints on space. I would stay there again...."
87,1200,"Dec 29 2008 	Great base for theatre and shopping	We stayed in this hotel for one night on a trip to London to celebrate my husband's birthday. Intended to see Les Mis and shop. We were very impressed with the quality of accomodation and friendly professionalism of the hotel. As a central London base it was ideal. Close to theatres and shops but far enough away to encourage a walk and to provide an escape from the throngs of shoppers and tourists.We stayed in Room 1503, right at the top, and it was huge and gorgeous but right above the lifts which disturbed me but not my heavier sleeper husband. This was a little disappointing as we ha gone for a top of the range room.The lifts were also a bit of a problem, only 3 and one of these was not working. This led to long waits when going up to our room and we chose to walk down.Breakfast was good with service going on until 12pm which was ideal for our sense of relaxation away from the kids, but no Sunday papers available which suprised me."
88,1200,"Dec 21 2008 	Not the usual square box	I've stayed in three different rooms at the Cavendish this year, each has been different in size and shape. Due to the layout of the hotel, the rooms are not uniform, I found the best room was the corner room which was probably the quietest. Avoid the rooms next to the lift shafts, the lifts were very noisy from around 4:00am, caused by the departure of airline flight crews. I did complain about this, and I was moved room and offered a complimentary breakfast for two.I like The Cavendish because it offers quality accomodation at a reasonable price, in a fantastic location. There are deals to be had, check the American discount sites, Travelzoo, Hotwire etc. It is my theory that some European hotels only offer deals on the American sites in the hope that any booking will be for more than one or two nights, and better revenue for the hotel.There is no loyalty scheme in place, but once registered as a guest, you are the first to here of future offers - which can be very good. If you book 'room only' try Fortnum &amp; Mason's Fountain restaurant for breakfast, opposite the hotel. A real treat."
89,1200,"Dec 16 2008 	Great Hotel Even Better Location!!!	Having decided to bring my wife to London, to see 'Dirty Dancing' (her favourite film) for her birthday, the race was on to find a decent hotel, with a reasonable price and a great location. The Cavendish London fitted the bill perfectly.We stayed in this hotel from Saturday Dec. 13 - 14.Arrived in Heathrow airport, collected luggage and headed straight for the Underground. Bought 2 tickets (single tickets to Green Park 8), down the escalators and onto the tube. So easy! The tube did get busy the more we got into the city, however, people we friendly. After approximately 40 minutes we got off at Green Park, per the advice from the TA forum - thanks guys. Altough, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk (in the lashing rain!) from the tube, I would probably get off at Picadilly the next time. We arrived at the hotel, which is located on the very quiet Jermyn St, to be greeted with a smile at reception. The receiption staff are very friendly and efficient. We were given the option of having a room on a higher or lower floor. We choose a high floor for the views - room 1108. I booked a standard room as we were only staying for one night (due to having no annual leave left!). The rooms are small - average sized for London - and very stylish. Nice comfy bed, flat screen TV, CD player, nice bathroom, etc. As this was our first time staying in London, the location aspect was important as I didn't want us wasting limited time on public transport. We definitely weren't disappointed with the Location of this hotel. The hotel is basically a very short walking distance to the likes of Picadilly, Leicester Sq, Regent St, Oxford St., Bond st, etc. And prices in London are notably cheaper than Dublin.This is a great hotel and I would highly recommend it for a city break in London. We will definitely be back."
90,1200,"Dec 5 2008 	Doubt we would go back	Stayed at the hotel many times, very central and a perfect position for the shops. However the last time we stayed we woke in up the night to find silverfish (insects) running around the bathroom floor. Reported it to reception who didnt pass the complaint on. Waited 3 weeks for a response so rang and spoke to a manager who said theres nothing they can do and the insects are not harmful, which seems far from the point. Harmful or not, it would seem unacceptable to stay in a 4 star hotel and find insects running around the bathroom. We were told silverfish live in everybathroom . . . not that Ive ever seen!! Would think twice before returning."
91,1200,"Dec 3 2008 	My favorite London hotel....	I just completed two seperate stays at this hotel, at the beginning and end of a trip to Ireland in November. This hotel has a lovely, safe location close to the parks, palace, Traf. Sq., Bond street and Picadilly. Hotel is not too small to lack amenitites but not to big to have to wait for everything (like room service, check-in/out, elevators, bellman, etc.) Rooms are small (most in London are ) but nicely furnished with great bathrooms and the most comfortable beds and bedding. Housekeeping standards are very high. Room service food way above average and FAST, however I wish the menu selection was larger. Check in staff wonderful...arranged early check in for us on both stays! Concierge staff is mixed, some being wonderful and some being rather distant and haughty. No doubt about it..... London is a big, expensive city and I often feel after reading many hotel reviews that people are often not very realistic about what to expect. I feel my money is well spent at this hotel as the service and quality remains consistent and the location is great!"
92,1200,"Dec 1 2008 	Lovely Hotel not sure if I'd return	Been to London a few times and have stayed in a few hotels around the Marylebone and mayfair areas before so this was somewhere different.This hotel is lovely, the entrance and reception area is clean, tidy and modern although quite a number of people commented on the smell of fish when walking in the side door of the hotel uuhhh. The rooms were really nice but the major downfall is the paper thin walls. I have been to many hotels around the world but this was terrible on both nights we had to ring reception and give the wall a battering due to next door. There was prob about 4 people in the room chatting and laughing til all hours not doing any real harm but the first night we had been up that morning since 5.00am and had done a bit of shopping really not in the form for listening to s**t talk next door. The following night we came back to hotel round 12.00ish as we had an early start the next morning and the same again. The reception did make the calls requesting they be quiet which they did respond - we could even hear their phone ringing and them talking. Breakfast is great , on at the weekend until 12.00 and have no complaints about it. The bar is quite dead. This hotel really is in walking distance to everywhere picadilly, leicester sq, bond street, oxford st, buckingham palace but very few places to eat near by and quite a 'gentleman' shopping district. All in all grand but the area wasn't my favourite."
93,1200,"Nov 19 2008 	perfect location	Had a really good experience at the cavendish, the best thing was that, after a day out and about sight seeing, it was within easy walking distance for the bars and restaurants in the evening,  We did upgrade our room to superior, which after reading reviews about the classic rooms being on the small side, we were glad to do, it did cost us an extra 20 per night, but we thought that that was reasonable enough. Room was very clean and comfortable. We felt that the lobby bar drinks were expensive but then i suppose thats just the norm, especially in London.The only problem we did have was with breakfast, we thought that they had forgotten about us at one point, then when we did get our food, it was'nt quite what we ordered.Would recommend it to anyone, and cannot wait to visit again!"
94,1200,"Nov 5 2008 	We enjoyed the Cavendish	My wife and I stayed at the Cavendish Hotel last weekend and we very impressed with the whole experience. The staff were helpful, we were able to check in at around 11.00am. The room was small but first class. Being on the nineth floor, we had a good view from our window. The breakfast was superb! There was an excellent choice from the buffet and all was well cooked.We would recommend the Cavendish to anyone, it's close proximity to the West End was an added bonus.Well done Cavendish, we will see you again!Mr.&amp; Mrs. Hanson.Halifax , West Yorkshire."
95,1200,"Oct 28 2008 	greekblackdog	I booked the cavendish after reading about it on the internet and got a reasonable deal on the room staying from Friday to monday morning. Yes, our bedroom on the 7th floor was small but it was clean with clean towels every day plus complimentary papers and tea/coffee making facilities. The downside was the prices in the lobby bar for drinks and the service in the restaurant of a morning, one example trying to get fried eggs to have with your breakfast was a nightmare you could guarantee you would have finished before they arrived, on our last morning there were no mushrooms or black puddings as they had not had a delivery?. The night we were going to the Concert at the Royal Albert Hall we decided to have a meal in the restaurant. The room was cold and when I asked the Manager he said he would turn the heating up but as we were by a drafty window it proably wouldnt help but we did overlook fortnam and mason, he didnt offer to move us even though there as plenty of space.One of the best meals outside we had was at Brumas opposite Her Majestys Theatre on Haymarket also Prezzos again on Haymarket. The girls servicing there were brilliant nothing was too much trouble and it was the same price for 2 courses as in the Hotel at 14.95 for 2 courses or 19.95 for 3 courses."
96,1200,"Oct 26 2008 	Had a lovely weekend at this hotel	I have just come back from a weekend theatre break booked through superbreak. We had a number of hotels to choose from but decided on this one because it was a central location. The hotel is located in the middle of picadilly circus and green park tube station. To the left of the hotel is theRitz hotel and Buckingham Palace and to the right is Regent Street and Soho. It is in walkable distance to the Apollo Shaftsbury (we did get a taxi though). However, it is ideally out of the way of all the hustle and bustle). We stayed on the 14th floor in a superior twin room. The room was clean, fresh and modern. The beds were comfortable and it had a large flat screen tv. The breakfast in the hotel was superb - fruit, cereal and cooked breakfast (however we did have to wait around 15 mins to be seated - it was very busy. Over the weekend breakfast is served until 12, so you enjoy a nice lie in. Room service was available for food. The food was very nice, however it was expensive and 9 pound for a glass of wine - but worth a treat. Overall we enjoyed staying at this hotel and would stay again."
97,1200,"Sep 29 2008 	Decent hotel good location but just short of 4*	The Cavendish London served as a great base and a decent home away from home for a girlie shopping weekend (27-29 Sep). The overall experience was pleasant but fell short of my expectations of a 4* London hotel.We arrived before 10am on Saturday and were able to check in straight away into a Superior Twin on the 14th floor. The room was nicely decorated as seen in photos, of a decent size and came with everything the hotel website specified. Bathroom was compact but fresh and modern. Minor complaints about Housekeeping - mugs were dirty when we checked in, hairs and carpet fibres found on bed after 1st night.We had minimal dealings with the staff but found them pleasant. Checking in and out was smooth and professional, there were no surprises on our final bill. Buffet breakfast was served on Sunday, we were seated straight away in the airy and bright breakfast room and had a lovely selection to choose from. This morning's service (Monday) was made to order and I must say service was a bit slow considering there weren't many tables. We had room service one night - ordering was fast and easy, the food arrived on time and was piping hot and of decent portions.As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is 5 minutes walk to Picadilly Circus tube station. If you take the Picadilly South Side exit, as you climb the stairs to exit there's a Tesco Express directly behind you and the hotel is on that same street. Jermyn Street is filled with quality shops for men and women's workwear, there's foot traffic at all times so we felt safe.For a London hotel, I think we got what we paid for (Winter Break weekend rate incl VAT &amp; breakfast 154/night from hotel's own website) considering the hotel's location and decor. Like several other reivews, I feel there's much room for improvement in terms of the staff/service. I will stay here again but not for a higher price."
98,1200,"Sep 29 2008 	Ideal Location but Tiny Room	We used to live in London, so when we came back for a visit we wanted a hotel that was centrally located, close to good tube and bus connections and on a quiet street. The Cavendish delivered on all three.Our only complaint is that our standard room (#713) was the smallest we've ever stayed in. However, it was clean and modern, quite functional (except somebody tell me where we were supposed to stow our suitcases). The bathroom, though small, had a shower big enough for two.The hotel is on a quiet street, across from the back door of the posh Fortnum &amp; Mason fancy food shop. The neighborhood drips with 17th century charm. The closest tube stop -- at Green Park -- offers multiple connections to almost everywhere, plus there are many buses on nearby Picadilly and Regent Streets.There are also ways to keep a lid on the &quot;extras&quot; to the room rate. The hotel hands out free 15-minute vouchers to use the 2 computers/printers in the lobby. Skip the pricey breakfast in the lounge and buy a healthy breakfast for under 5 pounds at E.A.T. or Pret a Manger on nearby Regent Street. All in all, a pretty good value."
99,1200,"Sep 27 2008 	Lovely hotel handy location!	I stayed here in August for a friends Hen Weekend. The staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms we had were a decent size - though not huge. Ask for a room on the higher floors as the views around London are better.We had breakfast at the hotel, which was very nice, with lots to choose from. We also used the hotel bar, which was nice as well. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening.The hotel is not far from Old Bond Street / Regent Street and about 15 mins from the theatres. Its really near 'The Ritz' and the 'The Dorchester' should you fancy treating yourself to some Afternoon Tea'!Would definitely stay here again!"
100,1200,"Sep 27 2008 	Not worth the money	I got a special offer on my room here &amp; therefore other rooms may be better. It was all fine &amp; the staff were perfectly nice...but just not worth the high rating it has on here, or the money you may spend."
101,1200,Sep 21 2008 	Very comfortable bed in great location	Great experience all 'round. The bed was luxurious with high thread count cotton and plenty of down. Friendly and efficient staff and a great location. I am going back.
102,1200,"Sep 18 2008	The staff are dreadful... Don't stay there!!!	After recently staying at the hotel, I was appalled by the level of service. Particularly as this hotel had been recommended to me by friends who had previously stayed at the hotel. On complaining to the manager he seemed to be disintereseted in anything I had to say.A few points they need to rectify are, there was no hot water, the windows were dirty, there were no bathrobes, the bar staff are appallingly rude? With every service you should only pay for the level of service you are provided with and are happy with. In this instance I would not expect to pay for a room without hot water? Although the hotel had charged my card at 2am in the morning before I had checked out?? No discount or refund was offered to me, even after I discussed this with the duty manager.I had very bad service in the bar area as well as at the check in desk.... I would say this hotel looks nice as you enter the reception but my room was nothing to write home about either. If the manager would like to take the time to consider what its paying customers are saying to him about the level of service people might be inclined to return. I can't see the point in making a complaint if this complaint is going to fall on deaf ears??? I suppose this is why we have trip advisor to warn others of the &quot;Kiaran&quot;, the managers total lack of customer service...... As he igorned my calls and ignored my complaints, all in all I would never stay at this hotel again very disappointing on all levels."
103,1200,"Sep 15 2008	Total Nightmare. The Staff are Appalling	Stayed recently for my birthday. Stayed previously when it was part of the De Vere Group a while ago &amp; had a really pleaseant time. However now, the staff clearly think they are massive time which is puzzling as while admittedly the location of the hotel is good, the interior (aside from reception) wouldn't look out of out place in a Travel Lodge. This time the staff were rude but the Manager Kiaran is APPALLING. A barman was amazingly rude to one of our friends who had joined us in the hotel for a drink , we also had no hot water, no iron and were locked out of our room at 2.20am. After raising this on check out I wrote to the Hotel Manager as well as the person we dealt with on reception couldn't care less. Kiaran (The Manager) was probably the rudest person I have EVER SPOKEN TO. He in fact made me cry, told me not to call him as he didn't think I had anything to complain about (he wasn't there during my entire stay) and I wouldn't be getting anything free so leave him alone. I'm the Marketing Manager for a UK wide chain of Resturants, we welcome feedback good and bad from all our customers - not at The Cavendish. Please don't waste your money on this tin pot operation. They want your money but couldn't care less about the quality of your stay. Try Malmasion!!"
104,1200,"Sep 10 2008 	Great Place To Stay!!	We stayed 4 nights at the Cavendish Hotel in Mayfair on Sept. 2008 . This hotel is in a great area real close to piccadilly Cricus. The Staff were excellent and really whent out of there way to help you with anything you needed. Super nice beds and covers, Plasma TV, Stocked frig. ( Charged to your room if you take anything out). There is a holder inside the room that you put your key in to turn on the power to your room on , if you take the key out the power goes off."
105,1200,"Sep 8 2008 	Good clean hotel in a prime location	We stayed at the Cavendish twice - once at the beginning of our trip and after returning from Paris. I chose the Cavendish based on reviews, price and location. What we paid included breakfast was about right - 138 pounds, but got a standard/classic room. They tried to upsell us to a larger room for 25 pounds, but did not take the bait. The room we received was TINY - the smallest hotel room I have had in any major city. My husband and I had difficulty arranging our small carry-on suitcases where we could both access them and walk around the bed to get to the bathroom. The second time we stayed there, our room was slightly larger, but not by much. The breakfasts were plentiful and definitely gave us energy to start our days. The hotel was clean and the location was close enough to the attractions/tube stop to be convenient, but far enough away to be quiet at night. The service was polite and all in all this was a nice hotel experience."
106,1200,Sep 7 2008	Great location....terrible staff	This hotel has a great location but the staff are pretty dreadful....Staff at breakfast were very slow at taking stuff off the table..However the variety of food available was great..The worst staff experience was when I asked the person on reception to book me a taxi for a specified time in the evening...she freaked out and couldn't do it...please ask concierge she begged...no concierge was availabe hence I had asked her...had to wait for the concierge to come back!! Stunning stuff..The hotel could be great..needs new staff though.
107,1200,"Sep 3 2008 	Great London Hotel Experience	The Cavendish was as good as the many reviewers said it would be! The rooms were comfortable, with excellent air conditioning, and furnishings. Our &quot;Executive&quot; room had a wonderful shower, and a view across severel rooftops to the London Eye &amp; Big Ben. Breakfast was top notch, both an excellent buffet, and the opportunity to order additional selections off the menu. The only minor complaint (very minor) is that when the dining room gets busy, service can be a bit slow, But with a very good buffet available you will not starve...You may just have to wait a few minutes for your coffee/tea!Staff was cheerful, and the Concierge, was helpful and friendly, they made it very easy to get tickets, and vouchers for plays, and tourist activities.I was originally thinking of staying in Leicester Square, or Covent Garden to be closer to the&quot;Action&quot; but I think that the guiet, yet central location of the Cavendish was a better choice. I also originally was looking for a hotel that was more traditionally British in style. Modern style has it charms too, especially when considered next to more expensive, and sometimes creaky old alternatives. The Cavendish was Perfect!"
108,1200,"Sep 3 2008 	Thank God I wasn't maying for it	On arrival I was immediately offered an upgrade! Fantastic I thought, but then came the crunch, it would cost me 25 per night. The receptionist was quite insistent that the standard room was small and pokey and that for a mere 25 I could upgrade to a superior room with views of Westminster! The look on my face must have been such that she knew wasn't onto some tourist sucker who would be impressed by a grey skyline. The offer was soon dropped to 20 per night for an upgrade. She must have been on a commission to sell upgrades. I explained to the receptionist that:a. I was not some dumb tourist who could be ripped offb. If my room was not up to standard I would be back down to ask for a better roomc. I could not care less about the Westminster views (I live in the Highlands of Scotland where the scenery is the best in the world and the views from my kitchen are stunning)Apart from my upselling experience the hotel us indeed very good. My client was paying for me to stay there and I understand that they get a good rate. I dined in the hotel and had the breaded plaice - superb! Followed by breast of chicken with potatoes and some vegetables - fantastic. It was just what I needed and the perfect balance for a late dinner. The staff were outstanding and attentive when required. The room was small but better than some of the hotels I have stayed in in London. Big TV, good air conditioning, fabulous bathroom and the bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to my client's offices, and lots of places to eat out and have a drink. Shops too, the famous Jermyn Street for shoes, clothes and especially shirts. One draw back no draught beer. But there are pubs close by that can cater for that.Overall an excellent place to stay in London."
109,1200,"Aug 22 2008	Will definitely be back!	Really swanky hotel in an excellent location, The Cavendish is definitely one to go back to!Our superior twin room wasn't quite ready when we got there at 2pm so we were both offered a complementary drink at the bar and a tray of nibbles - room was ready within 40 mins. I thought this was areally nice touch. All staff were excellent and really professional. Breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts ive had, everything was piping hot and the selection was extensive. We also tried there pre theatre menu - only 14.99 for two courses, and I would definitely recommend it - we both had rib eye steak and it was the best we have ever tasted.Room was nice and lovely toiletries, and everything is so close to the hotel.It is very hard to find a single negative point about this hotel, but if I really had to, I'd say maybe the room was slightly smaller than I expected, but with so much to do in London, we were hardly in it!If your going to london, definitely stay here!!!!!"
110,1200,"Aug 20 2008 	Fantastic location and luxurious hotel	The hotel looks pretty unassuming from the outside, but it's all opulent luxury inside! The location is just a few minutes walk from Picadily Circus, is literally just behind Fortnum &amp; Mason, and a short walk from the restaurants of Berkely Square. Nearest tube is Green Park. The rooms are small, but they work well. Air conditioning cools the air, the bathroom is petite but the shower is huge. Fixtures and fittings were very modern, with an elegant wall-mounted flat screen TV. The bed was very comfortable, and I had a great night's sleep. One side of the hotel has amazing views over many London sights, especially from the 10th floor.Breakfast was really really good - not only was there a buffet, but you could request an omelette or eggs benedict or poached eggs to be cooked for you. Plenty of fruit to make muesli exciting too, and smoked salmon for the decedant!"
111,1200,"Aug 17 2008 	Location-location-location	Stayed here for 5 nights august 2008. The hotel is in a great location. Smack bang in the middle of everything, but still on a quiet backstreet. Everything was VERY clean and in good condition. Compared to other Londonhotels it is above averege. I would compare it with an above averege-Hilton hotel in the USA. The rooms are in standard-european size, Not too small, not too big. The ONLY downside is the sillyprized breakfast (42 dollar per person). We bought a sandwich and milk every evening in the grocery at the corner and keept it in the fridge overnight and eat that for breakfast instead, and that saved us 80 dollar every morning. We would definitly stay here again.Peter &amp; IngelaSweden"
112,1200,Aug 16 2008 	Great Hotel in Great Location	Great hotel in a great location. Free apples at the front desk. Staff extremely helpful. Free internet. Climate control in room was perfect. All in all a great hotel.
113,1200,"Aug 10 2008 	London Calling.	We stayed 11 Nights at the Cavendish and it was great. We upgraded to an executive room which had a great separate shower and bath. Located on the 10th floor, we had great views of London including the London eye and Big Ben. The rooms are very clean and spacious, very modern facilities and everything in good working order. The turn down service was pretty cool, each night receiving a bottle of lavender spray to spray on your pillow to aid in a restful night sleep!. The hotel is central and pretty much every major tourist attraction is within walking distance.. Those that are not are always easily accessible by the 2 close tube stations (Green Park and Piccadilly Circus). If you are in London for a show, the hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the west end. Several nights we had diner at the restaurant and they were the best meals we had in London. The pre-theater dinner menu is quite a good deal, being considerably cheaper than the 'main dinner' menu though receiving the same portions. The staff were very friendly and always keen to help you with anything you may need. &lt;begin rant&gt; My only complaint with the hotel (and this is a personal gripe I can not stand) is the use of those stupid fridges that charge you the moment anything is removed from it. I find these fridges rude by stopping you from putting your own items in. I know they are in the business of making money and want you to buy the overpriced drinks but If I cannot even keep my own water cold then I am annoyed &lt;end rant&gt;"
114,1200,"Aug 2 2008 	Clever choice	Just returned back from a week's stay at the Cavendish. A clever choice for London.1. Location: Perfect, everywhere walkable:) Right across Fortnum and Mason's, Piccadilly: 5 mins, Buckingham: 15-20 mins through the lovely Green Park, theatres: most within 15 mins walking distance. On a quiet street and as safe as it gets.2. Hotel itself: Clean, comfortable and well-run. Booked from the hotel site and got a queen superior (the standard rooms are a bit too small but would probably be acceptable acc. to London standards). Reasonably sized room, comfortable bed and pillows, shower pressure ok, bathroom clean and in good condition, cd player present but not i-pod, daikin airconditioner working properly, ironing board, wireless... Civilized breakfast, until noon on weekends and till 10.30 on weekdays. Nothing to complain about, really. Before going, I had sent an e-mail and asked for a room on the higher floor if possible; got one on the 11th with a view of the London Eye, beautiful. No sports facilities, though.If you, like me,-Are tired of tired-looking commercial chain hotels like the Hiltons and Sheratons;-Would rather not stay at the top luxurious ones like the Ritz and Mandarin Oriental unless it's a very special occasion;-Would rather not have to deal with the budget-accommodation related problems during vacations;-Would choose clean and contemporary over musty-smelly-flowery-dainty; and appreciate technology:This hotel would definitely do."
115,1200,"Aug 1 2008 	Will be back soon!	Just had to write a review about this fantastic hotel. We recently went there for a family summer break and the enjoyment was mostly down to the excellent hotel and the wonderful service we recieved. All members of staff were totally helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble . The rooms were really nice and clean and we were upgraded to the executive room which had a massive double shower, robes , slippers etc. The location is second to none and most major attractions are within walking distance. We will all be returning there very soon. I stayed at a top 5star hotel in london last year and is is very difficult to pinpoint the difference between hotels , apart from the price , of course!Try and get a deal which includes breakfast , we didn't eat until 6p.m after the full english!"
116,1200,"Jul 28 2008 	Perfect Location	Had a great stay at The Cavendish this weekend and felt compelled to write a review.Having booked tickets for &quot;Spamalot&quot; in the West End we were looking for a well priced hotel within walking distance and The Cavendish was perfect. I don't think there is a hotel in a better location for the price, we paid 99 for a superior room excluding any breakfast.During the weekend we didn't use taxis or the tube once. It was a 10 minute walk up Shaftsbury Avenue to the Theatre and a further 5-10 minutes walk to Covent Garden.As we didn't eat at the hotel, I can't comment on the restaurant. However we had Sunday brunch at Christopher's, near Covent Garden, which I can highly recommend. Next time we stay breakfast at Fortnum &amp; Masons is probably on the cards, as it is directly opposite the hotel.Although right in the centre of London, it was relatively quite once you got into Jermyn Street. The hotel itself had a nice relaxed atmosphere, when we got back from the Theatre around midnight the bar was open with a few people having a night cap . Our room was on the 11th Floor right next to the lift, but we didn't have any disturbance from the lifts at all.All in all a fantastic stay and a great location. Tips if you are taking a car:There is no congestion Charge in London at the weekend.Street parking is free from 6.30pm on Saturday around the Hotel.Westminster Council Car Parks (Leicester Square) have a Theatreland 50% discount if you are seeing a show. http://www.westminster.gov.uk/Carparks/theatreland.cfm"
117,1200,"Jul 23 2008 	Perfect weekend	Having scoured the reviews of available London hotels for a birthday weekend treat, the Cavendish seemed like a pretty safe bet. I was not disapointed. Location was fantastic and we were able to walk everywhere. We were offered a room upgrade for an extra 40 on arrival - glad we decided to do this as the new room was not exactly huge - but very smart and comfortable with a luxurious bathroom. Breakfast was delicious - especially if you order from the menu. Not an inexpensive hotel - but you get what you pay for!"
118,1200,Jul 22 2008	The Classy Cavendish	We have enjoyed two weekend breaks at the Cavendish in January 2008 when we went to the Tutankhamun and Terracotta Army exhibitions and May 2008 when we went to see Bruce Springsteen at the Emirates Stadium. Staying at this super hotel made sure both our weekends were really enjoyable.The hotel staff are efficient and friendly. If you ask for a room with a view you will not be disappointed when you see the London skyline at dusk and dawn. The hotel is situated behind Fortnum and Mason and is ideal for sightseeing and shopping. A delicious English breakast was included in our room rate and the room was large and very comfortable. We are already looking forward to our next visit.
119,1200,"Jul 20 2008 	Fabulous Hotel!	We spent 2 nights at The Cavendish in a Superior Queen room. The room was a decent size for London and the bathroom was very spacious with White Company toiletries. The walls were a little thin, but it wasn't too disturbing. The view from our room which was on the 14th floor was amazing - you could see the Gherkin, St Pauls, Nelson's Column, The London Eye and even Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Air con was useful as you can't open the windows and it can get a bit stuffy. The TV has a selection of satellite channels which includes Sky Sports which is a nice bonus.Breakfasts were fantastic, huge range of fruits, yoghurts, cold meats and cereals. Also a wide selection of pastries and croissants. On the Friday the cooked breakfasts are ordered via a waiter and brought to your table. On the Saturday the cooked breakfast was a buffet style, but if you wanted anything different you could still order off the menu. I would recommend getting the breakfast included in your room rate as we did, because at 21 per person plus 12.5% service charge, it is pretty steep!Staff on reception and the concierge desk were very friendly and efficient. I would not hesittate in recommending this hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in central London. The walk to Picadilly tube is only about 1 minute which is really convenient, and there is a Tesco Metro at the end of Jermyn Street (towards Picadilly) as well if you need any supplies."
120,1200,"Jul 14 2008 	Nice modern rooms - great location	Stayed here for one evening at a weekend. Rooms are nice, modern, well equipped with quality bed linen/towels etc. They are a little on the small side - we had a superior room but it was still pretty small. Superior rooms at the Grosvenor (marriot) on Park Lane are much nicer but are a bit more pricey. Apart from that, good hotel."
121,1200,"Jul 13 2008 	Great Location - OK Hotel	Firstly, this hotel is in an excellent location and worth considering for that reason alone. It is directly behind Fortnum &amp; Mason and less that 5 minutes walk to Piccadilly Circus!However, we were staying for a special occasion and for this, I don't think I would recommend it to others. We paid for a junior suite for the weekend (250per night) and despite me stating on booking that it was a birthday celebration we were still given a fairly small ish room right next to the lift workings (as the lifts don't go to the top floor) and facing the opposite way to the river. When I asked for a better room the receptionist claimed that noone had ever complained about one of their suites before or any noise from the lfts (which is a bit hard to believe as it made a fairly continuous banging sound) and made us feel very awkward for asking. After a lot of huffing and puffing we were given a different suite that was at least twice the size and had a corner position (same price and clasification, so bear this is mind when staying). The rooms are OK but in need of some maintanence, 1 example is that a hole in the bathroom wall above the sink had been filled with what looked like tissue and then left? Breakfast is not good (really sloppy eggs that didn't look healthy at all) and the service was quite poor and fairly slow. On the Sunday morning we had to wait over 20 minutes to be seated as there was a queue of at least 18-20 people, which made us late to meet friends.A mention though that on the Sunday (my partners birthday) they did leave a cake in the room for him which was a nice thought, although we were out all day and only found it late when we got back, so it didn't get eaten.If you just need somewhere convenient to stay then do stay here in one of the basic rooms, but if you're looking for something to splash out on or to spoil someone, I'd pay the bit extra for a really special hotel as this one is likely to leave you really a bit ripped off."
122,1200,"Jul 10 2008 	everything I wanted	Very freindly and easy going staff. Location was brilliant, as were the facilities and comfort. Rooms were very clean, had a 'new' feel about them and offered plenty of space."
123,1200,"Jul 2 2008 	Nice long weekend	I stayed here for three nights over the Queen's Birthday in a junior suite. The room was on the penthouse floor, although I can't remember what the name of the room was. It was large with a chaise longue and writing desk and faced out over the park. Pros: double-sinked bathrooms (the secret to harmony at any hotel), a big, hot shower, enormous, comfortable bed, robes and a view.Cons: super expensive internet, no separate conditioner (it was combined with shampoo - not good for long hair), no lift to the floor (just inconvenient if you have lots of bags), limited TV channels.I booked through the hotel website, and paid around 220 GBP per night. Standard rooms were even cheaper. I would probably stay again because I think this is an excellent price for this standard of hotel in London. The only thing that would stop me is the internet fee as I can't travel without it."
124,1200,"Jul 1 2008	Very nice a bit bland and boring.	Stayed with my husband for 5 nights. The Cavendish has the listed address, but also an entrance on Jermyn Street, across from Fortnum and Mason, and in the midst of all the wonderful Jermyn Street boutiques. It is about midway between the Picadelly Circus and Green Park Underground stops, a few minutes either way. This is really a very nice hotel, but the rooms are small (and we travel a lot). We have been to London several times, and this location is good, but the nearby restaurants are expensive, even by London standards. I just personally feel that other areas, especially Marylebone, are more fun. And, for the money, I think we could have done better.BUT, MOST IMPORTANT, this hotel WORKS. Meaning, the air conditioning functioned. Rooms were serviced promptly, extra towels arrived promptly when I asked, and the maid refused a tip.This hotel is a good solid choice, no surprises, but no action in the area, either, so you have to make your own choice. Looked like a good choice for business travellers, free wi-fi in the lobby.London is about the greatest city in the world. Go and have a good time, and try to forget how obscenely expensive it is.RE restaurants: Find Shepherd's Market off side streets on the other side of the Green Park stop. Several cute reasonable places there, loved &quot;The Market Brasserie&quot; (French). Did not like Getti's on Jermyn St, but really liked Rowley's, also fairly reasonable."
125,1200,"Jul 1 2008 	Gem of a hotel!	I have just returned from a two-night weekend stay which I booked as a surprise 30th birthday gift for my partner, along with tickets to see We Will Rock You. First and foremost, the location is FANTASTIC! It is situated on Jermyn St, directly opposite Fortnum and Mason and parallel to Picadilly. It is within easy walking distance of atrractions such as St James' Park, Leicester Square and Buckingham Palace. As I am not keen on the tube, it was ideal as we were able to walk everywhere, including Covent Garden and the London Eye. It is a stone's throw from the West End/Soho and Theatreland, so it is ideal if you are planning on seeing a show. I booked a Classic Double Room online at the Advance Purchase Rate, which was 288 for two nights, including the buffet breakfast. Given the location and the fact that this is a 4* hotel, I felt that this price was excellent value, especially as the breakfast is usually 21pp. The room itself was pretty small, but well kept. The bed was the comfiest bed I have ever encountered! The room had a desk, drinks making facilities, minibar and safe. There was also a plasma screen TV and CD player too. The bathroom was also quite small but was beautifully finished and had a huge walk-in power shower. Breakfast is buffet-style and is served until 12 noon. There is a great selection, including cereals, breads/pastries, cheese, cold meats, fresh fruit and cooked breakfasts. You can also order various other items in addition to the self-service items. We also had a pre-theatre dinner at the restaurant, which was delicious and at 14.95 for two courses wa excellent value for London. My only problem with the restaurant is that service can be quite slow, particularly at busy times.The hotel in general is styled in a contemporary manner and although the hotel has 15 floors, the shared areas such as the bars and lobby are not particularly big, which gives it a nice, intimate feel. The bar and lounge prices are expensive (9 for two bottles of beer and 4.80 for a coffee!), which is a shame really because we certainly would have spent more time in there if it hadn't been for this.The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I managed to get a CD stuck in the CD player on the second evening and I informed the gentleman at reception on my way out. By the time we got back, it had been fixed and they had even put my CD back in the right case, without a scratch on it!I will definitely book the Cavendish if I return to London in the future. For the price I paid, the excellent location and the general pleasantness of stay, I don't think you could find any better in all of central London. I will certainly be recommending this hotel to others."
126,1200,"Jun 5 2008 	Just right.	I have just come back from staying at The Cavendish for one night which we won through work! The hotel is situated just off Regent Street in a very nice area. The reception is small but decorated very well with lots of purple and light(!!). The reception staff were efficient, polite and helpful (always a bit of a surprise in London!!).We had a twin room on the 5th floor. The room was small, but average for London. The decor was lovely, very modern. Spotlessly clean. The beds were soooo comfy. Some nice touches, like a revlon hairdryer in the room - ladies will appreciate. The only bad points - the TV didn't work - could only get BBC and it was quite noisy - sounded like we had a window open! Bar as expected was expensive over 10 for dark rum and coke! We went for breakfast in the resturant, it was self service but the food was fresh and hot. Very good as far as breakfasts go.... would say Hilton is better for breakfasts? But not overly concerned.Will recommend this hotel!"
127,1200,"Jun 3 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location	Stayed in the Cavendish from Friday 31st May - Sunday 1st June. Hotel is nice, and with the current exchange rate its quite 'cheap' by London standards for a 4 star hotel. Hotel is spotlessly clean, although the standard rooms are really small - my boyfriend is 6ft 2ins &amp; his feet never saw the inside of the bed!! the rooms are clean, nicely decorated, bright, with very comfortable beds. We had a rate that included breakfast (got it on the hotel website and it was only 1 more expensive than the rate without breakfast??? go figure) anyway, we ordered breakfast to our room (no extra charge for this) and to be honest - I'm glad we didnt pay more than 1 for it - the bacon was totally dried up, the hash browns were flavourless, my poached eggs were done perfectly, but the scrambled egg my boyfriend got looked gross - he said it wasnt great at all. We got THE smallest pot of (cold) coffee for two people, and no salt / pepper on the tray. Overall the breakfast was a big disappointment - so much so that we decided to eat out on Sunday morning. The lobby of the hotel is quite nice, but really small for a hotel with so many rooms. The bar is also quite small and be warned - very expensive. 2 bottles of beer cost us 9 - whereas in the pub around the corner it was only 6 for the same 2 drinks. The location is second to none, you can walk everywhere (the Ritz is only around the corner). If you want a nice comfortable clean hotel in a great location in London - go for the Cavendish.."
128,1200,"Jun 1 2008 	A gem near Piccadilly	I stayed here for three nights in May 2008. The Cavendish is a stylish boutique hotel with impeccible service. It's tucked down a quiet little street (Jermyn) and only five minutes walk to Piccadilly Circus. Also it's right opposite Fortnum &amp; Mason which is a great place to splurge on a fancy English breakfast! I booked a Superior room for a little extra. The room was not large (but good for London). They called it a &quot;City View&quot; but there is nothing to see. The room itself was very well decorated, nice furniture (fee based internet if you need it) and a wonderful bed with down pillows. The bathroom is large and modern. It has a complicated tap system in the shower and weird semi see-thru doors.There is a small bar in the lobby. It's not very cosy but it's nice and gets busy late at night. On check-in they will give you gift coupons for the bar, which is a nice touch (if not, ask) The staff were very helpful and quick to assist at reception and a great concierge. Room rate was around 150 GBP a night which is a lot these days for us third-world Americans ;) but well worth it for a perfect weekend stay in London. Travelocity (pay in USD) gives a better price than the hotel web site.Tip: be sure to hang up the Do Not Disturb thingy; otherwise housekeeping are aggressive to get in early :)"
129,1200,"May 31 2008 	terrific value	We stayed for 1 night in one of the junior suites which are situated on the top (15th) floor of the hotel. It should be mentioned that the lift service stops at the 14th floor, with 3 small flights of stairs giving access to the 15th. We normally stay at the Savoy but it is closed at the moment so we looked for a decent hotel in Piccadilly as we were in town to try a restaurant in Berkley Square. I chose the hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and looking at a couple of booking agents websites. I was still a little apprehensive about things but when we found the hotel (set back from the road - you could miss it ) I relaxed.The lobby is mid sized and modern, check in was efficient. When we entered our room we both had the same reaction - result!The room was large, well furnished and spotless, and the bed was sublime. The best was yet to come however as the bathroom was simply brilliant. A large bath, double wash basins and an oversized shower, with plenty of towels etc. We've had this type of bathroom in the past but we didn't expect it at a 4 star. There were 2 Bose machines to use, a flat screen tv, and very importantly a kettle with tea and coffee available. It was very impressive, and I get harder to please as I get older. One niggle was the lighting system which was activated by putting the room key in a docking station by the door. I had to call reception to ask how we could turn off the lights without removing the key, but allowing a light to be used during the night. The hotel has 2 entrances, one on Duke St and the other on Jermyn St, opposite Fortnums. Breakfast was a very pleasant experience. Large comfortable,modern room with a choice of the usual hot/cold buffet. The food was hot and good quality, and the service was much better (efficient &amp; friendly) than the Savoy. For the amount paid this was easily the best value I have had at an hotel for many years. I booked through Milesfaster and paid 240 incl breakfast and vat. My only complaint would be the lack of soundproofing. As mentioned we were on a floor above the lift but could still hear it clanking and banging - if you are a light sleeper this could be a problem. We would definately return."
130,1200,"May 31 2008 	Cavendish London --- Amazing!	We stayed at the Cavendish London in late-September of 2007. The hotel is centrally located in the Piccadilly Circus area and is close to several train stations. The hotel was very clean and in very good shape. The concierge staff was very helpful each morning in directing us how to get to where we wanted to go. I would highly recommend the Cavendish London to all leisure travelers. You may be able to find something cheaper, but I doubt it would be anywhere near as nice as this!"
131,1200,"May 30 2008 	Good value Great location and staff	The location in Jermyn St (close to Piccadily, Trafalgar Square and all of the West End attractions) is excellent. The staff were all very good, particularly on Reception and at the Concierge desk. We stayed in an Executive room on the 8th floor which, bearing in mind the price (200 inc breakfast) and normal London room sizes, was really spacious. Excellent bathroom with large walk in shower and bath. Breakfast was good and the pre theatre dinner was also excellent value. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and against London norms, we felt the Cavendish offered good value for money."
132,1200,"May 26 2008	Great hotel great location!	Stayed at the Cavendish, following reviews on Trip Advisor. It was perfect. 50 mins from Heathrow on the tube and handy for everywhere. Staff were really friendly and the breakfast was excellent."
133,1200,"May 12 2008 	Fab location! Beautiful hotel!	I LOVED this hotel! It was my first time in London, and I did a ton of research to prepare. I booked the Cavendish based on TripAdvisor reviews, and I couldn't have been happier!The hotel is on Jermyn St., an adorable and quiet street in London lined with men's clothing stores. Across the street is Fortnum and Mason's, a really beautiful department store/market. One block up you have Piccadilly, and Soho is a short walk away (great restaurants here!!). The lobby area is really nice, and the concierges were really friendly and helpful. Everyone here was so nice to me. I stayed here alone for part of the time, but felt totally safe in the neighborhood and couldn't have been happier. So many things are within walking distance -- Buckingham Palace, St. James' Park, Green Park, Westminster Abbey, The London Eye, Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Oxford/Regent streets for shopping, Whitehall ... The location is seriously amazing. I couldn't believe it!The decor is stylish and modern. Stayed in an Executive Twin room for 7 nights in April. The room is a great size for two people. I had a couple of nights when the walls sounded kind of thin and I could hear the person next door, but ... well, it is London, and the building is really old and historic. Also, was located on the 10th floor and had amazing views of the London Eye and the Gherkin. The beds are sooo comfortable, with fluffy duvets. Breakfast was included - I started each morning here, and they have a wide spread of choices plus tea and coffee. Definitely get the rate with the breakfast included. You also get a newspaper with your room each morning, which I enjoyed.Stayed here again for 2 nights in May. Decided to try the Standard Room to save money, and it just does NOT compare. I was not impressed with the Standard Room, but the Executive Room is great. Lucky for me, the a/c broke in the Standard Room that first night so they upgraded me for free to an Executive Suite for my last night in London. That was such a treat!Can't wait to stay here again. I consider this a &quot;mid range&quot; hotel in terms of price. For my budget, I couldn't be happier. The location alone makes this hotel totally worth it ... just definitely get the Executive Room; it's worth the extra money."
134,1200,"May 11 2008 	fantastic value for money.	stayed here for two nights at the end of April. Reception staff were very good and efficient and the staff in general above average in service. The breakfasts were excellant and the food of a good quality., we had a standard room and were thrilled with the quality of the beds and linen as we had just had an exchausting week in Morocco and needed the sleep! Would happily stay here again. BTW I was suprised to read a previous review that mentioned the high cost of internet here. I use a WIFI device and had unlimited access to the internet with no charge, an excellant service.Would happily recommend the hotel"
135,1200,"May 10 2008 	Great Location Nice Rooms	Stayed at The Cavendish for 4 nights on a recent business trip. The location can't be beat - just off Piccadilly, a 10 minute walk to Regent St, Grosvenor Square and 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace, etc. Was given a lower floor room - 3rd - but it was a &quot;deluxe&quot; at the end of a hall so it was basically a mini-suite. One area had a couch and desk, the other a large bedroom with very comfortable king bed. The bathroom was wonderful with separate shower and tub, lovely fixtures, nice amenities, etc.No real complaints. A few nit-picks; scuff marks on walls from luggage, a few carpet stains, etc., but nowhere as bad as some rooms in which I've stayed. And they didn't tell me that their restaurant was undergoing renovation so that meals could be taken in a small lobby bar. That wasn't appealing but certainly not problem in a neighborhood with a plethora of food options. (Oh - and my room looked onto the backside of Fortnum and Mason - so lots of good food within a stone's throw.)Considering the rate of 260 pounds per night - a relative bargain in London for a mini-suite - I can't complain and would stay here again. Gay man, super picky - I would stay here again."
136,1200,"May 7 2008 	Good location Clean boutique trendy style but noisy	Stayed here for 2nights, room 1102The rooms are indeed small, but that's very common in a metropolitan city in Europe (try Paris hotels!).I never have problems with tiny rooms. Boutiqe style. Furnitures are new, clean and stylish. Carpet clean.Bed was very comfortable and bouncy. Cd/Stereo player in the room (no external plug/usb/mp3 though)Location is perfect, just behind the Fortnum &amp; Mason (I really have no clue what the fuzz is about that store).Despite the quiet street parallel to the busy Picadilly, it was still very noisy, because I got a room on the street side. Even on a higher floor (11th). The hallway-noise is also loud. Maindoors slamming and alot of echo in the hall way. Walls are abit too thin. Could hear my neighbour snoring and talking/watching tv. It was full house, so room change wasn't possible.I was adviced for next time to book rooms with number 14/15 or 06/07 (end of the hall and on the court side)Haven't tried breakfast. No comments.Overall, I really like the hotel style, service, cleanness, location, trendy and comfortable bed. However I wouldn't stay again unless I'll get a quiet room with good sound-isolation , even from the hallway or neighbours.So if you are a good sleeper who sleeps through anything, I would advice you to stay.If you are a light sleeper, book end-of-hallway-on-the-court-side-rooms or don't book at all."
137,1200,"May 2 2008 	Great location but not quite there	We stayed in a standard double at The Cavendish and the room was definitely London small, but had some nice mod cons. I would describe it as OK rather than good (apart from the leaking sink tap). I booked this hotel for the location and for the quality breakfast described here on trip advisor. The location did not dissapoint and it really is right in the heart of London, but the food and service were poor for a hotel that prides itself on its culinary expertise. When the food turned up it was cold and I can only describe the scrambled eggs as mush on a plate. We also had to send one plate back twice due to errors, although the staff were very apologetic. Overall, I can't give the place more than a 2 out of 5."
138,1200,"Apr 29 2008 	Great value Penthouse Suite	We stayed for 3 nights in a Penthouse Suite (Room 1507) on the 15th Floor. For London this was absolutely excellent value for money with great views to the east taking in the London Eye and the City Financial District. The accommodation was very spacious. Entering through double doors into a small lobby you turn left into a large well appointed lounge with a wall mounted flat screen TV, a DVD player and a Bose sound dock for an iPod. There is a separate toilet and washbasin in the lobby area adjacent to the lounge as well as a small cloakroom for hanging your coats. To the right of the lobby is the bedroom with its own TV and a remote control Bose CD/radio and a very comfortable King Size bed of course. The bathroom is also very spacious, well appointed and has a large walk in shower as well as a good size bath tub for soaking in. The Housekeeping Manager for the 15th Floor knocked on the door to enquire if everything was to our satisfaction and within 5 minutes of mentioning that the bath robes were rather small two new large freshly laundered replacements were delivered to our door with a friendly smile.I have added some photos of the suite if anyones interested just to give some idea of style and layout and have pre-fixed them all with Room 1507 for ease of identification.The Cavendish is an excellent 4 star hotel with friendly and attentive staff. It is very well located at the junction of Duke Street and Jermyn Street only 5 minutes walk from Green Park Tube Station which is perfectly situated on the Piccadilly, Victoria and Jubilee Lines. Jermyn Street runs parallel to the busy Piccadilly and the hotel is roughly half way between Green Park and Piccadilly Circus. For Theatreland, the two next eastbound stops from Green Park are Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, although you can walk to Piccadilly Circus in only 6 minutes. One stop westbound is Hyde Park, or a pleasant 5 minute stroll across Green Park takes you to Buckingham Palace, or one stop north takes you to Bond Street for the shops there and on Oxford Street. Not only that one stop south on the Jubilee Line is Westminster for Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Downing Street, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye. So I think to describe the hotel as being well located is certainly justified.Just two other things to mention; some of the best deals are for non-refundable advance purchase direct on the hotel website, make sure you include breakfast as its very expensive to order as an extra. Also, the pre-theatre dinner menu at 14.95 served from 5.30pm onwards is very good value.All in all, we would certainly go back."
139,1200,"Apr 23 2008 	Great Stay !!!	My wife and I stayed at the Cavendish last week. Although the rooms are a little small, the hotel is awesome.Very clean, great buffet breakfast, friendly and efficient staff.The location is great for theatre and dining, and Oxford Street is only a short hop away.Would definately return !!!"
140,1200,"Apr 16 2008 	Great Penthouse view	There were four of us booked into The Cavendish for 2 nights in April 08. We had the Penthouse Suite and my sister and her husband had a Junior Suite.All the Suites are on the 15th floor, and the lift only goes up to the 14th, so you have to go up a flight of stairs to get to your room, but that wasn't a problem for us. Might be if you were laden down with bags though !The Penthouse is 1506, and my sisters Suite was 1507. The rooms were connected which I was surprised by. It worked out OK, but I wouldn't have been that happy if I were on my own.Both rooms were spotless and the huge bathroom in the Penthouse was the best Ive ever been in and gave a great view of London when you were on the loo !The 1507 Suite wasn't quite how it looks on the hotel website - no flat screen telly. But apart from that they were perfect.I got a great pre-paid rate off the hotel website (220 Junior Suite and 260 Penthouse), and would definately stay here again"
141,1200,"Apr 15 2008 	Loved the Cavendish	I came to London on business, as I sometimes do, and arrived late as usual (11 pm). Once again Holiday Inn had ignored my request for smokefree room, and I called my travel agency to have them try to dig up other accdomodations. And they found a little piece of heaven!!I moved to The Cavendish that same night, not knowing what to expect there, merely because they said all their rooms where smokefree. I arrived, and it was gorgeous - just the right size, supreme location (8 min walk to office), fresh mix of scandinavian and asian design. A roomy shower instead of clunky tub, very comfortable bed, and quiet - no noise bothered me all night. Breakfast the next morning was very good, but overpriced (21). Staff was very helpful and polite.Overall, this is now my favorite place to stay when in London on business!"
142,1200,"Apr 12 2008 	Fantastic hotel!	We booked for only one night, but were really impressed with the hotel immediately on arrival. Staff were friendly, rooms are clean and comfortable, and breakfast is great! The bar on the ground floor is cosy, and we especially enjoyed the cocktails.We are hoping to return in October, as the hotel is in a great location, so that we can complete all the things we found we really wanted to do. It is affordable luxury. Having stayed previously in the Savoy for much more money, the room standards were much higher (although the food was still fantastic there too!) Well worth a visit!"
143,1200,"Apr 5 2008 	Home from home luxury - brilliant location!	Hotel was very central; couldn't ask for a better location for visiting London. It had a nice informal atmosphere, purple reception area that was welcoming, modern and warm.We had a fabulous 14th floor room facing Big Ben, London Eye, Houses of Commons, could see St Pauls, Gherkin etc - the views were to die for! The room was very clean, comfortable and had all amenities needed for a great stay, TV, CD player, Tea/Coffee, hair dryer, iron ect. Mattress was exceptionally comfortable and room decorations were very attractive.Room service was excellent and prompt!All staff were friendly, warm, approachable and happy to help.Buffet breakfast with all you could want for...even for vegetarians like myself I managed a cooked breakfast that compared well to that of my meat eating partner! Restaurant overlooked Fortnum and Masons.We were on a 50th/60th birthday celebration weekend; took in a couple of shows, toured London and did some shopping - everything was on our doorstep - it was so so convenient!.Will definately use again when we visit London and highly recommend hotel!THANK YOU TO THE CAVENDISH FOR MAKING OUR WEEKENDSO SO SPECIAL!!"
144,1200,"Apr 5 2008 	Super location for all that the West End has to offer	In a great location adjacent to Piccadilly and opposite the back of Fortnum and Mason. Check-in a breeze and staff so helpful. Room lovely and a good size. Great bathroom with large bath and walk-in shower. Weve stayed in many hotels in London and can only say that room wise, this is as good as it gets for what we paid. We paid little more than in other hotels, but the difference was worth it. Most rates seem to include breakfast, but if yours doesn't 21is more than steep. It was the only let down of the whole stay but not enough to stop me from giving an excellent score. London is London, so I have rated purely on the standard of the accommodation so that people can put things into perspective. If you get a good deal, give this one a whirl! Five minutes walk to Piccadilly Circus and Theatreland."
145,1200,Mar 30 2008 	Quality persists only one problem outstanding	A fourth visit to the Cavendish (and this has to be my last review) confirms that this is quality establishment with good staff service and consistent quality. The convenient and relatively quiet location are definite advantages. Once again my only consistent gripe is that hot buffet breakfast is never hot.how can paraffin lamps under the platters achieve this and the odour of combustible vapour is not at all pleasant? Lets hope this can be fixed to create a perfect experience.
146,1200,"Mar 26 2008 	Smart hotel great location	We stayed at The Cavendish for one night on Good Friday. You can't beat the location, walking distance from Piccadily, Leicester Square, Convent Garden and the shops of Oxford/ Regent street.Check in was a breeze, reception staff were friendly and efficient.We stayed on the 9th floor. The room was small, but what do you expect in central London? It was well kept, clean, stylish and had everything we needed.Definitely a 4* hotel!"
147,1200,"Mar 25 2008	Luxurious but affordable	We stayed at The Cavendish on the Thursday before Good Friday, as we had a meal booked in town. We chose the hotel because of an offer with www.travelzoo.co.uk, and we were more than happy.We had an upgraded room on the 14th floor, affording great views of the London Eye, Post Office Tower, St Pauls and other landmarks. The room itself wasn't huge, but had a CD player (nice touch!) and tea/coffee making facilities, which is always nice.The bathroom was clean, modern and had nice toiletries. The shower was okay, but not the best.Best aspect was the bed linen and bed itself. The thread-count on the linen must have been really high, because it was amazing quality, and the bed was extremely comfortable.Great location in Jermyn St - close to Piccadilly, Westminster, St James Pk, etc."
148,1200,"Mar 22 2008 	Cavedish Lift Noise	I stayed with my wife in mid-March for two nights in a Junior Suite.Staff, breakfast and location all excellent - an enjoyable weekend.One word of warning though - if you book a 15th floor room, do not accept room 1502. One corner wall of this room conceals the lift mechanism. It clanked and squeaked throughout the first night to the extent that even ear plugs were inadequate! We changed rooms and the next night was fine. Otherwise recommended."
149,1200,"Mar 21 2008 	BOO!! good location but rooms only big enough for a bed!!	we stayed at the cavendish for 2 nights, 2 weekends ago.we previously stayed at the royal park hotel 6 mths ago. RP is a charming hotel but we wanted to try another part of town.we arrived and liked the fact the lobby resembled the photos taken by guest (good job!). check in was easy and we were given a room on the 10th floor. i had asked before we went up to the room if this was the best room they had available for our price bracket. they said yes. got to the room and mouth dropped. first thing we noticed was the size. the room about 11sqm/118sft. we had two small carry ons with us so when we put them on the floor at the foot of the bed, there was no room to pass. second thing was a howling noise. i thought the window was opened but it wasn't. they were not sound proof (and no, i'm not from the countryside and love city noises but this was too much). the wind against the cheap windows was so loud it was like a ghost was in the room... or you were in a tunnel.so we called down and ask if it was possible to change or upgrade our room and we were told we could for an additional 30 for each night we were staying. we said no because it wasn't worth it. we were already paying 150 for a walk-in closet and a newspaper. 180 can get you a different class of hotel in the neighborhood.because we were in LDN for fun, we ignored the room flaws, had a good time and just slept with ear plugs.on checkout, they tried to charge us for food we didn't eat from the minibar and that's when i wrote off this hotel completely. i don't like it when hotels are cheap with their guests, especially when they are not full. ok, enough of my [-].positives: decor was fresh. everything was clean. no chips on the wall, etc. nice shower/ bathroom. tiny but not leaky. bottom line: there are better hotels in town that give you more for your money."
150,1200,"Mar 13 2008 	great Mother-Daughter getaway	I booked this hotel last fall on the advise of a friend who used it for business travel. At that time, there were very few reviews for this hotel on Trip Advisor. I am pleased to see that it has &quot;come up in the ranks.&quot; My adult daughter and I had a short trip to London, our first time there. The central location was ideal for walking and sightseeing. As well, we felt very safe in the hotel, and in the area of Jermyn St. and surrounding streets, even quite late at night. The bathroom was a bit cramped (by Canadian standards) but beautiful and quite functional. The beds were wonderfully comfortable.I would definitely stay there again."
151,1200,"Mar 5 2008 	Good hotel great location	Stayed for one night, 1st March. Hotel is in a great location and it was a very pleasant stay. Checked in no problem at 2pm. Room 513 was small but had everything that you needed. Bathroom only had a large walk in shower (no bath) but it was clean and functioned well. Room was modern and had a nice comfy bed!Hotel is in a great location for Picadilly Circus and there was no problem with any noise etc during the night. Breakfast was excellent and we were able to leave our bag while sightseeing and collect later before our journey home.Would definately stay again."
152,1200,"Mar 4 2008 	Piccadilly Utopia	Excellent accomodation. Booked a suite on the 15th floor with fantastic views. Staff all extremely helpful, food great value at 15pp for a pre-theatre meal (2 course). Lots of good quality men's retail shops nearby but also not far to Regent St shops for the ladies. Highly recommended, especially for theatre trips."
153,1200,"Mar 3 2008 	the cavendish - an oasis of tranquility.	A Superb hotel in every respect .The standard of accommodation exceeded our expectations,as did the level of service from all the staff.The location is ideal in respect of all the main attractions and we would have no hesitation in recommending this venue to anyone contemplating a visit to London .The combination of the quality of the surroundings and genuine hospitality of the staff made a significant contribution to our stay and was an experience of a kind that is becoming increasingly hard to find these days....our sincerest thanks to all concerned.!"
154,1200,"Feb 29 2008 	Good for the Money - nice but not stuffy	We stayed here for 1 night in early Feb as I had booked a wine tasting day at the Londons Vinopolis and so we thought it would be nice to stay.We arrived at the hotel after travelling by train and the hotel looked nice and clean. Reception took a while to book us in but only because the man on the phone was having difficulty explaining to someone on the phone that they don't do single rooms, and they would have to have a double and pay the double rate. Went on for ages!But after that we went to our room - which in all honesty was quite small really - but it was the standard room we booked and we got it for 183 including breakfast for two so whos complaining. The only thing I would say is the room was musty smelling - each time we would walk in it wuld hit you. We had to open the windows when we were in it to tr and get some fresh air. The location (like everyone says and the reason we choose it) is fantastic! We walked to China Town and Leicester Square and Bond Street. And then got taxis to Harrods etc as got abit lost and walked in completely the wrong direction. We had a walk rounf Hyde Park on the Sunday morning which was lovely as it was all sunny - we were waiting for the shops to open and wanted to kill abit of time.The only thing I got grumpy about it nothing to do with the hotel per say - but just London in general. We have visited Londn several times for nights out and hav stayed in different hotels like the Berkely, Metropolitan, Raddisons, Westbury etc etc, and this hotel was good value for the money. HOWEVER I don't get why people are so happy to take terrible service from restaurants and still pay tips there! We had a bad experience at lunch which put us in abad mood i guess - as we waited 2 and half houts before we had our main meal! Then when we said something - the waiter just said everyone had complained and thats was it. Then we were looking for somewhere to have dinner - and shouldn't have but got tired of walking - so ended up in a Angus steak bar - we both love steak and they were heaving so thought must be good. Well we got stuffed in the back - where they had cut the width of the table to half to make it fit and you couldn't get your leg past the table leg - and then we had our steaks which were ordered rare and came so overcooked I don't think anyone would have ate them. This from a place that specialises in steaks - then we sent them back and they were ok when they came again - but half my husbands was full of threads which meant he couldn't cut through it. Then when we got the bill we were shocked to see - we had to pay 1 eac for some bread they had brought wihtout asking, and the chips and potato we had with th steak were extra. So we paid over 50 for two steaks (not very nice ones) and 2 diet cokes!!! How mad is that!! And the people round us who complained about there food etc kept leaving 10 tips!!!! I don't get it!!!But hey - thats no reflection on the hotel - they did a nice menu which we could have had but had 2 courses for the same cost - but we thought hotel food would be more than walking and finding somewhere. Hey - you learn.So basicaly - sorry for the rant - but the hotel is great locaton, OK beds, small rooms, nice breakfast!!!!! and easy to get to etc.Would go back if needed central location again."
155,1200,"Feb 29 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed at this hotel between Christmas and New Year for 3 nights and got a very good deal, in an executive family room for myself, wife and 11 yr old son. Booked via the hotel website, booking for family of 3, and pre-paying there special rate. Was called a couple of days later and advised that my son was extra.Discussed that their web page knew we were family of 3 at time of booking, and quoted price should stand. Hotel then agreed.Room was large and comfortable for the 3 of us. Bathroom was really super, with bath and seperate shower.Breakfast choice was first class.Location was great, and could easily walk to all the main attractions in London.Would thoroughly recommend this hotel, especially if you get a good deal. We found the best deals on the hotels own website."
156,1200,"Feb 27 2008	Great Stay Once Again at this Hotel	We stay at this hotel every time we come to London and this must be about our 10th stay. Excellent as always and, if anything, slightly better than previous stays. Breakfast was exceptionally good and plentiful.Only very minor negative would be the too soft pillows. Bed was soft but this was nice for a change.Would have no hesitation in staying here again as it offers everything a London hotel should offer."
157,1200,"Feb 24 2008 	Modern Hotel GREAT LOCATION	We have just returned from a weekend break at London, staying at The Cavendish Hotel. This hotel is the perfect location for sightseeing in the city. 5 mins walk and you are at Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Square, The Ritz, Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street to name a few. Mega!! Rooms are average size, clean and modern. We asked for a high level room and was not disappointed. We stayed in room 1014 on the 10th floor and have a great view of london looking towards St Pauls and The London Eye. My only concern was that the walls seemed a little thin as it sounded like the man next door was choking to death!! Breakfast, again splendid and well cooked. Overal this hotel is a real great base, modern, good rates and m,ost of all a brilliant location. I will be back there from now on."
158,1200,"Feb 19 2008 	Little Things Mean a Lot	Once again The Cavendish has come up trumps for my wife and I on our second visit in four months thanks to the Website Auctionair. Not only did we get an upgrade as per the booking but we got an up grade to the upgrade and finished up in an Executive Room with monster bed CD Player, excellent bathroom efficiently maintained ,as before. Only minus point was that the room smelt of smoke - not a lot but sensitive noses picked it out. However, two open windows brought some fresh air.Once again the breakfasts were well above average and very well organised thanks to the friendly staff. We also had an even better evening meal than last time, making Saturday night special.If we had any criticism it would be the design of the lounges which could be more attractive, but that is due to the design of the First Floor to accommodate the lifts, taking a great chunk out of what would otherwise be a welcoming area.All the staff we met were attentive and polite and gave us every assistance.This is an ideal hotel to stay at for all London's attractions. It was but a short walk to Leicester Square to enjoy the Chinese New Year celebrations. Since our last visit the hotel has introduced a brilliant booklet on London which will answer all your questions on where to go and where to shop.But best of all - and sadly you will be too late to enjoy this as it only happens on February 8/9/10/11 or on the first week in November - set your alarm for 7.00am and look out of the window if your room overlooks The Wheel and you will see the sunrise right through it. Magic !!Shall return ? Of course.Tony and Hilary IrelandCheltenham EnglandAstrotravel"
159,1200,"Feb 18 2008 	Fun trendy hotel great location	I stayed at the Cavendish for business, the rates (as an American) are a bit high (approx $500 USD a night). The beds are comfortable, the service is EXCELLENT, and the location is great! Will definitely go back again!"
160,1200,"Feb 12 2008 	Stunningly beautiful	My husband booked this hotel as part of a weekend away for my birthday and I loved every minute of staying here. It was a bit of a nightmare to get to, through one way streets and heavy traffic but it was well worth it on arrival. Concierge parked our car so no worries there and the hotel is right opposite Fortnum and Mason so you're right in the thick of the action. Perfect if you're seeing a show in the West End, which is what we did as you are only about a 5 minute walk away.The room was gorgeous, really modern but with a glass bathroom door so you can't be shy, especially when concierge arrived with our bags and husband was on the loo!The bar is lovely with tasty nuts brought over to your table and nothing seems too much trouble.Breakfast is also top class. Hot and cold buffet and all delicious and very fresh.I would recommend this to everyone. I can't wait to come back!"
161,1200,"Feb 11 2008 	A Fantastically wonderful hotel - can not wait to go back	I stayed in this Hotel in January and after reading several reviews was slightly wary of staying here. I stayed here for a girly weekend.Our flight was delayed by two hours and we had had a hectic morning so by the time we arrived at the Cavendish, we were a little more than stressed. We put one foot inside the hotel and there was a gentleman there to greet us with a fantastic attitude to his job and instantly took both our very heavy suitcases of us. We then checked in and as it was only a few minutes after 12 noon our room wasn't ready, but we were extremely hungry so decided to have lunch in the lounge area on the first floor - and it was absolutely amazing and well worth the money about 20 for two.When we went back down to reception our room was ready. The Room was HUGE. I've stayed in many a standard hotel room and by far this was the biggest and best. It had EVERYTHING!The only thing that was slightly strange was that the bathroom door - you could see straight through it. We discovered this when my friend went to use the bathroom and the bellboy arrived with our luggage at the same time. It was an extremely amusing incident and only added to our fun!This hotel is about location, location, location. you can walk nearly everywhere, and where you can't walk to the most in a taxi was 7. Really close to the Ritz, Bond St., and Oxford St and only one minute to Piccadilly.When we got back to our hotel-I had ordered a bottle of champagne as a surprise for my friend- it was also her birthday.It was waiting for us and there was also a birthday cake and birthday card with it - even though I had only once mentioned we were celebrating my friends birthday. (The cake was amazing).The concierge were the most fantastic people I've ever encountered in a hotel, they would do anything they could for us, made dinner reservations,gave directions and were fun to chat to.Breakfast - well what can I say - FAB it was really nice, loads of choice and really fresh and again the staff couldn't do enough for you. Overall - i've already made plans to go back and stay in this hotel, and I can not wait. Would recommend to anyone and we've made our girly weekend in London a yearly event, purely for the hotel"
162,1200,"Feb 5 2008 	Junior Suite - Excellent but make sure you get room 1503	stayed in room 1503 which is a penthouse junior suite. booked directly with hotel and paid 253 for 1 night stay which included breakfast. after reading many reviews on here decided to opt for the cavendish due to recommended location and level of sevice experienced by other tripadvisors and was not dissapointed on either count. on arrival we were assigned room 1505 which had no lcd tv and despite the large oversize bathroom did not really feel like a suite(or even a junior suite). wasn't happy at all with this so went down to reception to air my feelings - beware when booking a suite, they don't all have lcd tv's as you are led to believe on the website - reception staff very helpful and quick to react, spoke to manager and was offerred different suite but also no lcd tv. i told them this was not acceptable either and they should either give me a discount or find me a room which met the description on the website. within 15 minutes they managed to assign me room 1503 which is most likely the exact room you see on the picture in the website and definitely better than 1505. it was a different layout(i think 1505 was on a corner) and felt much larger and a proper junior suite with an enormous bathroom, excellent double sized power shower. separate bath and his n hers sink/vanity areas. the lcd tv is only about 28 inch but has sky sports 1, 2, and 3. now i felt like i was getting some value for my money - if that is possible in a london hotel!. 10 out of 10 for staff attitude and willingness to help with my problem, they really did excel themselves and turned my stay from a dissapointing one to a thoroughly enjoyable and pleasant one. everything else has been well documented in previous reviews, excellent breakfast, large comfy beds(although the mattresses are very soft indeed so if you are used to a firm mattress then you may not get a great nights sleep), great staff attitude and willingness to help, and great location. all in all, i would stay again and would recommend to other readers. a very well run hotel indeed."
163,1200,"Jan 29 2008 	great location but small rooms	Have stayed here before and the location cannot be faulted. It's in really nice spot, safe and secure, close to tube and bus links and shops etc.we had a small room that had a tiny bathroom that wasn't even big enough for two people to fit in at once which for a superior room was pretty poor to be honest.Pillows could have been better and the bed was incredibly bouncy.Overall the service was good but 21- for breakfast was a joke."
164,1200,"Jan 26 2008 	Mmm Breakfast	A perfect place to stay to see a London show, with major theatres within walking distance. The hotel is located on a quiet street only steps from Piccadilly Circus and a few mins walk away from both Leicester and Trafalgar square.We booked direct with the hotel and got a good deal which included breakfast (lovely sausages) and asked for a high floor and view (see photo) which we certainly got. We arrived just before the check in time and our room was ready for our arrival, and although situated opposite the service/housekeeping room we were not disturbed at all.The room and bathroom size was as expected bearing in mind the location and was very clean and well maintained. The bed was super comfy!We picked this hotel from the reviews on this site and also for its location and were not disappointed, and as mentioned by a previous review shopped in the Tesco Metro (a chilled screw top bottle of Pinot Grigio and some crisps) for our post theatre refreshments.A first class stay in London!"
165,1200,"Jan 24 2008 	Great location small rooms	We booked this hotel for 3 nights stay in January 2008 via a special Travel Zoo rate of 85 pounds/night + tax (approx 100 pounds) for a Superior Room. We had just stayed in London a couple of weeks before at the Hilton London Metropole. Pros: amazing location and beautiful premises. The hotel is very close to Green Park tube station and Piccadilly Circus. The area is beautiful, with the Ritz near by and many boutique shops (Jermyn St. is lined with speciality tailors). The hotel is very well kept and the rooms are clean with great views. We asked for a quiet room and did receive one.Cons: If we had paid full price for the room we would have been disappointed. The room was very modern and trendy, but incredibly small and poorly laid out. On the hotel website it showed flatscreen TVs, but TV we were given was an old, small model. Compared to the Hilton that we stayed in a couple of weeks before for almost half the price, we did not see the value except for the location. If you don't plan to spend a lot of time in the hotel room, are by yourself, and want a clean and modern hotel in a central location, it is a great choice."
166,1200,"Jan 18 2008 	Fantastic location	Stayed here for 2 nights over weekend break to London. Location was fantastic for seeing sights, theatre district and shopping. Piccadily tube station close by, but easy walking distance to all attractions.Hotel was lovely, room small but expected in this area of London, but comfortable with all you needed for a weekend. Only ate breakfast in the hotel which was included in our rate. The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and friendly waiting staff. However, if it is not included in the rate the price is 21 which I feel is not a justified price tag!We booked a christmas special rate of 260 for both of us for 2 nights with breakfast on the hotel website. We feel this was a good deal, but would possibly have been disapointed with the hotel if we had paid full price."
167,1200,"Jan 9 2008 	Not 4 Star Service! Disappointed!	Myself and my husband stayed here for 2nights over New Year. Check in was fine, room was fine on the 10th floor, nice large bed, nothing overly 3 Star. I had booked through Active Hotels as usual, 390 for the 2 nights room only. They were charging 21 p.p for breakfast so we went to a little Italian just on the right as you approach Piccadilly Circus and had a scrumptious breakie there for 12 for the two of us. We flew into Stansted and got the train/tube to Green Park stop, 5min walk then to hotel. We didnt dine in the hotel due to previous reviews and anyway I wanted to get out and see about me. The first night New Years Eve we dined in the Avenue just down a side street off the hotel towards St James Pk. Very nice indeed, excellent service and modestly priced for good food! Second night as we were booked to go to the theatre we dined in China Town, Crispy Duck Restaurant (ask for a table on 2nd floor), lovely meal and reasonable price.Prices - The only time we drank in the hotel bar was New Years Eve after we returned from the London Eye and fireworks, we had one drink. Glass of champs and a coke 14. Also like to point out the prices are scandalous in the mini bar in the room, can of coke 2.50, and wait for it.a kitkat 1.50rip off! There is a Tesco at the end of street get your bits from there, but as it was closed over new year when we were there we werent able to avail of it!Service  The hotel bar was closed on New Years Eve, go figure! In saying that it wasnt really a bar, but more an add-on in the corner of the lobby with a scattering of chairs. This is supposed to be a 4star hotel, so you would expect 4 star service, think again! On check in I gave them a swipe of my credit card only to find on check out that they had actually charged 500 onto my card at that time. When I tried to pay on check out the receptionist made a big deal/show, saying that my card was declined, when I knew that the 403 of a bill should have gone easily on it! So got them to phone up the card company and it transpired that yes indeed they were holding the initial charge so they were trying to charge me 903 for my 2night stay! When I informed the receptionist Frankie of this he just shrugged his shoulders and said that he couldnt take off the charge until I paid the 403. As I had been at reception now for 45mins and was in a rush to get the tube/train to catch a plane I agreed to do this and told my card operator to watch out for the 500. A week later and several phone calls later it still isnt sorted out! So beware! I felt that the Cavendish staff didnt handle this situation well at all and that the receptionist staff could be doing with some training in Customer Service befitting a 4 Star hotel! So on the whole I wouldnt recommend this hotel. I will be staying elsewhere with better service and facilities for the price!"
168,1200,"Jan 5 2008 	Excellently Located - The Cavendish	We have now had two stays at this hotel - in September and November and are about to stay once more in January. We opted for a junior suite on both previous stays and were not disappointed - the views from the room over the rooftops of London are superbThe location of the hotel is excellent - opposite Fortnum &amp; Masons and literally a couple of minutes from Piccadilly and Green Park - lots of pubs and restaurants to choose from with only a few minutes walkUpon previous stays in London we have always stayed at One Aldwych, however, the prices there are not as competitive as The Cavendish and there is not a great deal of difference so far as quality is concernedThe breakfast is excellent and there is a huge choiceIf we had one criticism, we would agree with other reviewers in that the bar prices are a little pricey - if you don't want to pay those prices there are a number of good pubs nearby"
169,1200,"Jan 4 2008 	Brilliant Hotel	Stayed for 3 nights between Xmas &amp; New Year in a superior double room. We requested a high room with a view &amp; were not disappointed as room 815 overlooks Big Ben &amp; the London Eye. Our early check in was faultless and the room was modern, spacious (for central London), clean &amp; very comfortable. Breakfast at the hotel was lovely &amp; fresh but didn't change over the 3 days we were there. We had a pre theatre dinner at the hotel and this was very good value for money (2 courses 14.95), my only comment would be that there were no greens or garnish on the plate although you could order these as a side. The lobby bar is expensive as other reviewers have said (19 for 2 rum &amp; cokes). All the staff were very pleasant &amp; helpful. The location of the hotel is second to none with the tube (Green Park) and bus stops within a couple of minutes walk. There is a good choice of stylish restaurants around the hotel, along with a couple of traditional pubs that are not at all expensive. The location of the hotel for shopping and theatres is excellent and the London tour buses are available at a stop next to The Ritz and these are an excellent way to see the sights. Overall, we couldn't fault this hotel and we will definately stay here again."
170,1200,"Jan 3 2008 	Absolutely Wonderful!	My husband and I just returned home from our 7 night stay with The Cavendish in London and I must say we couldn't have been more pleased. We both heavily rely upon this website to get honest reviews and opinions of hotels because we travel frequently and this hotel was spot on. Please go on this review and not some others that complain about small silly things such as alarm clocks! We received top notch service beginning with an early check in and ending with a complimentary trip to Gatwick airport because of a silly mix up on football tickets. We were able to check in early and at our cost decided to upgrade our room so that I could have a nice big bathtub. Let me just say that the kind attendant gave us a FABULOUS room on the 14th floor with the most amazing views. The concierge was the best we have ever dealt with (thanks Ryan and Ben) and one morning we were too early for breakfast (included in our package) because we were going on a tour and they were fine to let us have our breakfast a full hour before the restaurant even opened. The rooms were nice and who cares if they are a touch small...you are on vacation...get out of your room :) Besides, I think that bathtub was the biggest I have ever been in. The beds were sooo comfy too. Location is fantastic and within walking distance to everything. Trust me, you will not be disappointed with a stay in this hotel. We would certainly return!"
171,1200,"Jan 2 2008 	Really nice spot in central London	Stayed at this hotel shortly after Xmas. Check in was friendly and swift and we were pleasantly surprised with our twin room. Room was a little on the small side and bathroom, though attractive and spotless, was also low on space. On our first night we were woken by rowdy revellers in the next room who again played really loud music the following evening. We notified reception and asked for another room and this was immediately granted with a very pleasant porter arriving shortly afterwards to escort us and our luggage to our new room. Bar service was excellent, though a little on the pricey side. Breakfast was a veritable feast to satisfy every appetite. Breakfast staff were most hospitable. Most mornings guests had to queue for available breakfast tables, with waits of up to 15 minutes. However, staff were making great effort to clear tables and keep things moving.Makes an ideal base for exploring theatreland and shopping. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
172,1200,"Dec 24 2007 	Couldn't be more central!	We booked this via an offer with travelzoo which gave us a discounted rate and a complimentary upgrade. The hotel has been nicely decorated, though it does feel like it can't quite decide whether or not to embrace the 1960's architecture or ignore it, so manages a bit of an unhappy mix of the two! Personally I'd just embrace it wholeheartedly and create a really unique property rather than something that does feel slightly corporate/cookie cutter. The room was a superior queen, on a high floor with a view over Westminster as requested. The room was only slightly larger than a classic double and really wouldn't be worth upgrading for unless you can get it for nothing. The executive rooms are far more spacious so if you've got the cash go for one of those instead! That said the room was fine with a decent TV, cd player and bathroom.Overall I'd stay here again for location as it really can't be beaten, however I'd be unwilling to pay the publicly available rate of approximately 140 per night at the weekend. Quick tip about breakfast...21 at The Cavendish or 14 at the Wolesley just around the corner... If you're on a room only rate I know which one I'd rather have!"
173,1200,"Dec 1 2007	Boutique-style hotel at nicely located eyesore	The location of the Caventish is great! The rooms are ok, but small, very small and not as stylish as you would expect from a boutique hotel at the price. In the corridor in our room there was a hole in the ceiling with tubes, valves and loads of dust underneath. Internet is damn expensive which makes it somewhat useless for business travellers which they might aim for."
174,1200,"Nov 29 2007	Loved the Cavendish	Stayed at the Cavendish for 1 night. Ideal location for exploring. Walking distance to 'Theatreland' and the main shopping areas. Spacious rooms with a fab view, nice breakfast and friendly staff. Will return!"
175,1200,"Nov 24 2007 	Superb Hotel	Stayed at the cavendish for one night in november and loved it so much i've booked again already!. The hotel staff are the friendliest i've come across and are so obliging. Fantastic location oposite Fortnum and Mason, two blocks from The Ritz and literally ten minutes walk from Leicester Square, so yes, smack bang in the middle of everything. Beautifully furnished rooms and amazingly comfortable beds. All in all if you like a bit of luxury and like to be in the centre of all the action then theCavendish isTHE hotel and i love it."
176,1200,"Nov 22 2007 	The best hotel ever!	Very central, modern but stylish, great view from the 14th, staff is lovely, I liked everything but... the bed that was much too soft for me. Nevertheless the incredible breakfast buffet made me forget about the night ;-)"
177,1200,"Nov 20 2007 	I'm a regular here	I've stayed here many times over the last few years. Its a nice place. Its had a bit of an image makeover since De Vere sold it. The best thing is the location; Jermyn Street is just sexy. Everytime I've stayed here I've had different rates... they've differed from very expensive to very cheap... each time however I've enjoyed myself. Get a room on a high floor and enjoy breath taking London skylines at night. Also, try and get a rate that includes breakfast, then have it served in your room."
178,1200,"Nov 20 2007	Great hotel	Stayed at the Cavendish for brother's wedding. Booked the lowliest room and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Modern, clean, well located near Piccadilly, great views from bathroom and room and valet parking under the hotel at competitive rates. Will definitely stay again"
179,1200,"Nov 14 2007	expensive but terrific	great rooms, nice views above eigth floor amazing location. More tradtional feeling though, and no gym.Not as hip as soho hotel or covent garden hotel."
