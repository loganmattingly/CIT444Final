3,40,"Nov 10 2009 	An OK hotel but give the staff English lessons	Hotel is centrally located. Subway station within 200 metres. Rooms are rather small and can be smelly because of smoking. Beds are rock-hard. The rooms are a bit outdated with an old TV in. No bathtub - only shower. The staff will try to help you in any way, but man, Chinese people simply don't speak English. So don't rely on the received information without double checking on it. Only one person from the hotel staff was able to communicate in English. The toilets are like in certain parts of southern Europe. Be careful with the amounts of used toilet paper or your toilet will malfunction. But still, be very happy about that standard. When you are out, don't expect a toilet, expect a hole and some solid isometric exercise of your thigh muscles. Like other reviews mention, our phone rang the first night, and we (or the I the man) was asked &quot;do you need girl company?&quot;. I refused and we weren't bothered again. The Harmony Hotel advertise with being one of the best 3 star hotels in China. In my opinion Harmony hotel is at best an average 3 star hotel in European standards and that's it.And Beijing. Can't describe it. You will have to experience it. It's easy to get around. We would recommend Beijing. And Harmony Hotel is an OK base to start every day from. But if you like soft beds, this is NOT your hotel to stay in.Camilla and Kim"
4,40,Oct 26 2009 	Good Service	We stayed at Harmony at the end of August. The service was very good efficient and quick. The first night they gave my husband and I seperate single beds. The next day I requested a double bed. They were very accomodating and moved us straight away. The location was good the price was reasonable. The beds were much harder than we are use to.There was no real social scene but we were too exhasted to do anything else but sleep.
5,40,"Aug 21 2009 	Clean but very basic	I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights in August 2009. On arrival the hotel is on a small road oppostie the train station.The staff at reception speak ok english, but you have to pay attention. They seem friendly and helpful though.The room was cleaned every day,to a decent standard. The bed however is the worst that i have ever slept in, in my entire life. To the extent were i had a bad back for the duration of my stay. There is only one english speaking channel CCTV 9, the programmes are very limited. NO BBC world service or CNN.The breakfast buffet was 45 yuan per person if it is not included in your package. it was ok and offerd a decent amount of chinese and western food.On the 2cnd floor there is a sightseeing company you can book daytrips with, we took 3 trips with the company with an english speaking guide. They were good days out, however they do include a trip to a local business on each trip, trying to sell u jade jewellery/ pearls/ and ornaments. Which personally i found uncomfortable. The staff do not leave you aloneThe bous of the hotel i think is its location, about 2km from the forbidden city and tianemen square. Also very close to wanfujing street, Beijings main shopping area.Taxis can be ordered from reception and are really cheap."
6,40,"Aug 5 2009 	Not my cup of tea	I stayed at Harmony Hotel in Beijing in July 2007. It was part of a tour we booked through China V-tours. They recommended it to us, and since we didn't have much time to research we took it...The hotel was the worst part of my China trip. The private tour (private car, driver, guide for pennies, really) itself was amazing, and would highly recommend it, but not the hotel. Although it wasn't my regular 4 star, I was expecting more out of it. I found it quite dirty, and quite scary...Though we requested a non-smoking room, and were put on a non-smoking floor, everyone seemed to smoke but us...The smoke would constantly be in the room. When we asked to change rooms, they told us that there weren't any available. I'm glad we left at 8am each morning and got in about 10pm or so, as it was hard to stay in the room. It also seemed that the walls were made out of paper, as we would hear ppl out in the hallway and in their rooms. The maids would vacuum way early in the morning before 7 am at times and it was hard to get ready in peace. The front desk wasn't too nice..They seemed to never smile, nor greet us with a simple hello. Only one person spoke broken English, so it was hard to communicate...Luckily, we had our tour guide, and she would translate for us. Breakfast was included, and it was just ordinary...The actual location of the hotel seemed a little too scary for me, and we often were bothered by aggresive locals who would sit in front of the hotel. On the positive note, the hotel is close to a lot of attractions, as well as to the train station...There are also plenty of little convenience stores (which was great) and local restaurants just around the corner...We ate at two or so and the food was ok...Overall, I wouldn't return to Harmony hotel, as I didn't feel comfortable staying there; however, I am quite picky. But if you're looking for a budget stay in a convenient location, and don't mind being disturbed through the night and early morning, Harmony might just do; afterall, most people are in Beijing to sightsee and not lounge around the hotel..."
7,40,"Jun 16 2009	Friendly staff good location	We stayed in Harmony Hotel from May the 28th to June the 1st. They gave us for mistake a room with king size bed, but they changed it immediately with a twin-beds room. The staff was friendly and they helped us giving useful information. The room was big enough and clean. We asked for a hairdryer and they provided it to us within few minutes. If you need to use internet just walk towards the post office and on the corner you will find an internet point opened 24h. It's much cheaper then using internet in the hotel. The location is very good, close to the subway from where you can the reach the major attractions. I booked this hotel through w----------m with a promotion rate and accomodation was much better than what expected. I would definitely stay again in Harmony Hotel!"
8,40,Jun 3 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location friendly helpful staff good price.	The Harmony hotel was fine for myself and 4 friends for a two night stay. The rooms were simple but clean and we found the beds fine. The location is great. We didn't eat at the hotel as there is plenty of choice nearby.The staff at the desk were always helpful and english was not a problem.Only issue we had was getting there. Not the hotels fault but we caught two taxis from the airport. One cost 90 yuan and took 50 mins the other took two hours and cost 135 yuan. The driver did not seem to know where the he was going and got caught in major gridlock. This was after I had given him the written address in Chinese and english. He even borrowed my map at one stage and rang the hotel. Return trip to airport was fine. 45 mins and 93 yuan for each taxi.Only drawback at the hotel was the cost of internet access at the business centre. 1 yuan per min. ouch!!
9,40,"Jun 2 2009 	Nice comfortable clean fantastic location 	Harmony Hotel is very convenient especially if you are doing your own thing as it is located just opposite the railway station. Take the airport shuttle from outside the airport although you have to book tickets in the airport. People dont understand english &amp; dont know where small hotels are. However, the ticket issuing person does. Take the shuttle bus to the last stop Beijing station.(but it stops before) Walk ahead for 10 mins or less until you reach the station .Keep looking up across the road to your left whilst walking &amp; you will see a board with the hotel name. Go on the overhead bridge to the opposite side &amp; take the first right into the lane. Cross the road &amp; its the tall building there. Dont ask rickshaw or taxi drivers as they will tell you its in the opposite direction &amp; charge some ridiculous price as they have to go right round. Some of the staff speak english &amp; are obliging. Changing money at the hotel is good value. We stayed in a deluxe room which was marginally more expensive than the standard room. It was lovely &amp; very comfortable. Book on the internet &amp; make sure you dont choose internet sites which do not allow you to cancel or change your booking as we have had problems with this resulting in loss of money.Transport is very cheap. buses cost 10p (1yuan) around the whole city. Subways 20 p. Make sure you have small change. Try the dumplings &amp; buns in the little shops outside the hotel. Go to the 2nd one on the same side of the hotel. It costs 50p for the whole plate. It is very difficult to get fresh coffee there except in the restaurant. Mac Donalds near the overhead bridge did an excellent deal with coffee &amp; breakfast if you didnt want to eat at the restaurant. The sights are within easy reach. Ask the reception. we walked outside the Forbidden city &amp; found a travel agent with conducted tours to the Great Wall etc. I think the tours at the hotel are good too in comparison. Internet is expensive at the hotel.10p a minute. Couldnt find any internet cafe there. Telephone calls too are pricy. Take the train to Xian from there. Flights are overpriced &amp; can be cancelled at will; as ours to Hong Kong was."
10,40,"May 19 2009 	Slept like a Log on a Brick Wall	Although the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable, I managed to sleep well,(after the third night), because of all the walking I did. The hotel staff were excellent and &quot;padded&quot; my bed after one complaint to the Front Desk. The Front Desk staff were very friendly, spoke English and went out of their way to oblige us. As my travel companion is a non-smoker, I spent considerable time outside speaking with the Doorman. We &quot;traded&quot; Chinese for English words and it was FUN.The Breakfast Menu was plentiful and a wide variety, offering both Chinese and Western breakfast. There was more than enough food. The wait-staff, although spoke limited English were also obliging, a gesture on my part sufficed."
11,40,"Apr 25 2009 	Basic hotel in a great location	The Harmony hotel is in a great location near two metro stations as well the city's main train station. The busy shopping street of Wanfujing is in easy walking distance (around 15 minutes) and shops are open until late. The area around the hotel itself is great, with lots of restaurants where it is possible to buy a great cheap breakfast which is much better than the bland offering in the hotel. We were particularly fond of a chinese fast-food venue (i've forgotten the name!) which was located just over the road from the hotel, the staff at the counter spoke great English &amp; helped us order lovely traditional chinese breakfasts. There is also a nearby vegetarian restaurant which does an all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast, you can't miss it as there's a member of staff outside selling the restaurant every morning. The hotel rooms themselves are clean but basic. Staff were helpful, providing a hairdryer and allowing us to access our money which was stored in a safe behind the reception counter at no charge (the room itself didn't have a safe). Internet access within the hotel is only available within a dedicated computer suite and is quite expensive and slow, instead walk around the corner from the hotel where a local internet cafe is located (you will need to show proof of ID to use a computer)."
12,40,Apr 7 2009 	Cleanwell located friendly staff	The hotel is well located within walking distances of most city sites.The rooms are comfortable and very clean.The only problem is that the shower does not have enough water pressure.Upstairs you can book tours of Beijing and The Great Wall of China.Accommodation is very reasonable. Taxi from the airport costs about 100 yuan
13,40,"Jan 13 2009 	Best buy for the price	This hotel is the best price performance, in my experience so far. Location is one minute walk from nearest subway station and also near the main road to forbidden city, tiananmen, or wangfujing area. And also near many mini market, where you can buy water, snacks etc.My room is clean and big enough. the standard room has no bath tub but very clean.If you spend almost whole day outside, and come back at night. And what you need is the clean room for rest. It is the best for 30 USD i pay for the room.I dont interact very much with the hotel staff. Only when check in and check out."
14,40,"Jan 5 2009 	Phone stolen from room housekeeping 'found' after police were called	Location was pretty good right near main train station, lobby nice, breakfast strange mix but ok. would rather eat out and much cheaper. Beds hard but they are everywhere in china, but our major problem was we booked one night, our last night before returning to the uk and thought after staying 4* in some fab hotels we would go for one night in a more 'budget hotel' as we would literally only be sleeping there with a busy day/night planned. we checked in put our stuff in the room and left our mobile phone in the bedside drawer, went out for the day, came back it was gone. We turned the room upside down, 3 times, and rang reception, who were less than helpful and told us they would look at cctv in morning, and said they think we had lost it, we were ademant we hadnt and had to spend the next 3 hours in reception trying to get receptoin to acknowledge our problem which needed sorting that night as we left at 9am the next day, so after 3 hours of being ignored by reception, who refused to call the police so we could report and get a crime reference number, a different lady came on and after another hour called the police. to cut long stpory short we spent until 3am at various police stations on our last night, and mirsculously, the next morning, we had a knock on the door 8am, housekeeping had miraculously 'found' the phone all of a sudden, Make of it what you will but after the whole experience, and the attitude of reception i definitely would not stay here again or recommend the hotel. hopefully by looking at other reviews it was a one off, but for us it wrecked the end of our trip!"
15,40,"Dec 8 2008 	Good location	This hotel is in a great location. As are others. I had requested 4 star and this is not that. Cannot say it was bad but was very lacking in some areas. Hotel staff not over friendly or helpful. Bar is minimal and not comfortable, so needed to head out after dark, and after a long day, don't want to do that. Breakfast was a mixture of goodness knows what. Not conventional by any means. Hotel is quite old, although no complaints about cleanliness. The shop across the road was great and you could get whatever you needed there. A 5 minute walk to the Railway stn, 20 minute walk to major shopping complex where we ate."
16,40,"Oct 30 2008 	Lovely Beijing	Clean and neat hotel with great location. We stayed during 30th Sep to Oct 4th and the breakfast is same every day but good value. The receiption staff can communicate well in English other staff are not that good but are friendly. I gave few clothes for laundry but some were missing. When I filled the laundry slip I had 4 clothes but later added two more of my wife's clothes also. But forgot to update the laundry slip. I left the laudry bag for collection but on return two of my vests were missing. On complaint the Hotel staff tried to identify the missing items but I also told them to forget it , if it can not be traced. Overall clean, neat and friendly place. Value for money."
17,40,"Oct 21 2008 	Hard Beds	Stayed here for 3 nights in a twin standard room. The beds were hard.....not just firm, really hard like sleeping on the floor.We stayed in lots of hotels around China and had no problems with the beds except for here. The reception staff were friendly enough but had very poor english and gave us mis-directions a few times. The room was clean, the bathroom very small but clean.The location was very good to Beijing Train station (3 min walk) and easy to catch a shuttle from Beijing Airport to station and then walk across the road to hotel. Was about a 40min walk to Forbidden city and 30min walk to Silk market."
18,40,"Sep 18 2008 	Good rooms so-so breakfast	I attended a conference in Beijing and we were booked at the Harmony Hotel. I thought the rooms were great, in that the beds were more than adequate and the bathroom clean. They cleaned the rooms everyday. The breakfast buffet was not up to par, though. It was the same selection day in and day out, and the food was so oily. The good thing is that right across the street are a bunch of convenience stores where you can buy soda and chips. Oh, and there is a hole-in-the-wall dimsum eatery right beside the hotel that sells the yummiest dimsum at unbelievable prices. It's around 10 pieces for less than a dollar. Don't expect anything fancy, or with complex flavors, though. This is good old comfort food dimsum that hits the spot. MUST TRY!!"
19,40,"Aug 24 2008 	Good hotel great location - get a good map though	I'm not going to go into tonnes of detail as every other review say it all - good clean hotel, excellent location, friendly English speaking staff. Bed was a little hard but thats because I'm use to a super soft bed back home - just ask for more pillows, they'll bring them to your room staright away.What I will say is first time the hotel is a little hard to find. Get yourself a good map with the hotel marked on it from the internet. Secondly, get the hotel address and directions written in Chinese to show the driver. And don't just get the address, the street is one not well known by most drivers and they don't have a clue where it is. The first 5 cabs refused to take us as they didn't know where it was. Luckly we found a New Zealand guy who lived in Beijing who climbed into the cab with us, phoned the hotel for us, and translated exact directs to the driver. Without him we would have been stuck."
20,40,"Aug 12 2008	Great location nice rooms	This hotel is in a great location. I stayed here after completing the Trans-Mongolian Railway journey from Russia. The rooms are clean and basic and good sized. The hotel was in easy walking distance to lots of great things to see, plus conveniently located near the Railway and metro stations. I would stay here again if I find myself in Beijing. Staff was friendly."
21,40,"Jul 15 2008	Excellent Hotel	Great hotel for short city break or longer stay. Staff were very friendly, rooms were immaculate and the hotel was very conveniently located to the major sights of the city. Would definately stay here again.One tip - do not visit the Zoo - it is very depressing!"
22,40,"Jun 27 2008 	Return Visit to the Harmony Hotel	Our first (happy) stay at the Harmony Hotel was 2002.Once again, commencing our TransAsia Silk Road journey we again enjoyed revisting the Harmony Hotel.The hotel's proximity to major tourist sights in this sprawling city cannot be over emphasised; the nearby Beijing Railway Station and Beijing Metro make farther flung attractions much easier to access.The rooms are very well cleaned and on the ocassion my partner accidentally dropped a bottle of beer in the room, the attention was prompt and the clean-up cheerfully executed. Yes, the beds are still very hard, but so they were in Xi'an, 'Turpan, Kashgar, etc. so I guess it's a Chinese thing!!!The buffet breakfast has adequate variety to suit the differing clientele.Plenty of various dining options ex the hotel are close by in the hutong. Also a well stocked convenience store opposite the hotel is ideal for purchasing those must have snacks, water, drinks (+alcoholic), and other interesting packaged 'goodies'!The currency exchange at the front desk is a boon.I have no hesitation in recommending this to budget travellers yes, but also to those who are a little bored with the 'same-same' of the safe (where am I?) hotel chains."
23,40,"Jun 22 2008 	Good value and good location	The Harmony is in a convenient location, a 20minute walk from Tiananmen Square. Better still, it's a short stroll from Beijing Railway Station, and from stops on two different subway lines (Dongdan and Beijing Railway Station). The hotel is up a side street, near the main post office. Quiet at night, but we always felt safe walking about.The staff were very pleasant and helpful, and were very tolerant of this jet-lagged westerner who locked himself out of his safe in the room twice in ten minutes (well it had been a long journey from England...). The room was clean and comfortable, with decent bathroom facilities. If I have a complaint, it's that the beds were very hard; good for the back I suppose...Breakfast was erm, interesting (eggs, smoked sausage, fried noodles etc). We only had breakfast once, then made other arrangements. Room service food was quite nice, and cheap.Of course there are lots of good restaurants to try in Beijing."
24,40,"May 24 2008	Great hotel perfect location reasonably priced!	We booked for a deluxe room at USD85/night---stayed for 5 nights but got one night for FREE! Hotel is conveniently located near a subway station which makes tourist spots like Forbidden City, Tiananmen, Lama Temple,Temple of Heaven very accessible as these are found a few strides away from the exit of the subway stations . Fastfood chains and restaurants are also just around the block (Mcdonalds, KFC etc).What's even better is they have currency converter inside the hotel---with NO commission or service fee! Tip : The hotel is very accessible from the airport. Take Bus 3 from the airport (CNY16) and get off at the last stop (Beijing Railway Station). The hotel is just a good 5 minute walk from there! You can take the same bus going to the airport. If you can help it, do not exchange your notes at the airport as FOREX in the airport charge CNY60 per transaction."
25,40,May 13 2008 	Good Place To Stay	Stayed at Harmony Hotel for 4 nights. Lived up to all the positive reviews. The room is clean. Staff are polite and nice. Got a good deal for the 4 nights. Paid 3 nights and 4th night free. Good location. Near to subway. Will definitely recommend to friends.
26,40,"Apr 8 2008 	Excellent for the price	My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights in March 2008. It is a nice hotel tucked down a small street a short walk from the fancy shopping district of Wangfujing. It is in a good location, close to shops and markets, and a short taxi ride, or about a 20 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City. It is also in immediate proximity to the subway, railway station, and convenience stores. It is adjacent to the Harmony Spa which my wife and I both had a good massage. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious, with a large living area. The shower was a little temperamental, and there was only one English-speaking news channel amidst the 40 or so channels. Besides from one or two people, the staff didn't speak alot of English. Although the decor is a bit dated (plush pastel pink and golds) it was very functional and comfortable considering the price we paid (around AUS$60). You would be hard pressed to find a comfortable hotel in as good a location for the price."
27,40,"Mar 30 2008 	Great hotel central and low-cost	Harmony was much better than we expected for the money. The rooms were clean, well serviced, and of average size. The reception staff were delightful and very keen to help. The breakfast was a generous buffet,with a good choice of Chinese, British, or Continental. We actually ate in the restaurant on two evenings which we would not normally contemplate. The only downside was a trip to the great wall which we organised through the travel agent on the first floor. Our guide,Fang, was really disinterested and unhelpful. But overall top marks to the Harmony for the price."
28,40,"Mar 30 2008 	A LITTLE DIAMOND	The Hotel Harmony lived up to most of the reviews,believe me I could not fault this Hotel for the price I paid. The staff was always courteous, the rooms where of a reasonable size,neat and clean. The location is excellent for the sub-way which is very easy to use. The staff at reception mostly could speak enough English to help in most instances, no real problems . The restaurant was of excellent value both for breakfast and lunch and dinner.At breakfast there was enough to choose from , even for the most picky type who usually end up in Mc donalds or K.F.C. which we all do at times. Give a try you will not be disappointed, my wife is of the most picky type as afore mentioned and in the end I had her trying all the different types of food and I think it might have changed her thoughts on foreign foods at last. The hotel is a good and honest 3 star Hotel and I was pleased I used it for my stay.They also have a travel company on the second floor, they are not the cheapest, but are good at what they do. Use the internet to plan what you want to do, and choose how you want to do it when you get there. on your own or with a tour operator, however I would advise you to do the wall and the Ming tombs with an operator. When you get to the area of the Hotel Harmony at first you might think it looks a little dodgy round here, but there are no problems, and it is very safe. I did most of the important sites in Beijing, and only seen 1 tourist trap, and that is at Maos Mausoleum. You cannot take a bag or camera into the mausoleum, and some helpful chinese person might try to show you what to do. Have nothing to do with them. They are after either money or some of the contents of your bag. There are signs in English to tell you where to take your bag or camera, it costs 10 Yuan, about 2 euros to store your bag. Its safe and easy to use. Pick the hotel Harmony and most people will be pleased, I cannot speak for everyone, but I am a very worldwide traveller and have stayed in most areas of the gobe in 5,4,3,2,1 and none star, and this is the first review I have ever written, so I can help you the public, which also helps the Hotel. One final thought, taxis or bus? IF you can afford it Taxi. it only costs about 15$ from the airport and is very cheap around the city. Hope this helps you all, I for 1 had a great time, Bai- Bai"
29,40,"Mar 26 2008 	Great location simple clean quiet and comfortable	We stayed at the Harmony Hotel in Beijing from March 05 to 15 in 2008. We booked our room before hand and chose a deluxe room over the standard (387 sq. ft. vs 268), which gave us a bit more room with a sitting couch and small table. Our actual room was #516 on the 5th floor of the 7-floor building. (see accompanying floor layout plan)The room (and the hotel in general) appeared to have recently been upgraded with new fixtures, paint, beds, etc. A lot of this type of upgrade has been, and is currently in progress throughout Beijing in anticipation of the 2008 Olympics in 5 months time. So, the rooom really looked new and very clean.Our room had two single beds, which quite frankly were the firmest beds we have ever slept in. Having a bad back, I welcomed this, however, I did think they were a bit too firm as we both had sore hips and ribcages after our week's stay. Like sleeping a a board covered with a mattress cover.Our room faced east but the morning sun (when it does shine through the smog) is easily and completely blocked by heavy drapes. (see accompanying photos)The bathroom was spacious with a full tub and shower attachment. The water pressure is sufficient, but the shower head makes it somewhat light, but still very acceptable. Hot water can be slow coming, and at times warm instead of hot, depending on the time of day.There is a small stocked mini-fridge/bar, which you can use to keep a few small items cool if you wish.This hotel has a power saver feature typical in many hotels in that part of the world, whereby you need to insert your access key-card into a slot in a device by the door to enable electricity to the room. We chose to always leave our second card in the device to keep the fridge and heating/cooling on while we were out.Power is 240-Volts, 50 Hz, so you will need a power converter and adapters to use 110/120-volt devices. Despite using the converter, my wife fried her power toothbrush charger - must have been the frequency (50 Hz vs 60 Hz), because we definitely had the step down transformer. Be aware that there are two differnt outlet types in the rooms: one that accepts the standard double flat prongs or round prongs, and the other that accepts a grounded plug but the prongs are at 45-degree angles (see accompanying photo). Given the very cheap prices, you may be better off buying a hair dryer or curler in Beijing.Although there is maid service each day, in order to converve energy you can leave a card on the bed to not change the linen - only make it up. We obliged, but chose to have fresh towels each day.We found our stay quiet in the evenings and at night, with no noises to wake us. However, we always travel with a white noise generator to mask out external noises.While there is cable TV with a good number of cable channels, the only english speaking channel is CCTV, a mostly news oriented channel.The staff's english is acceptable, but only a few are fairly fluent in English. For the most part, they were very helpful and accommodating.There is a business center on the 2nd floor, where you can use one of several computer terminals for checking email, etc. The cost of this service is 1 Yuan per minute, and the center is open from 8am to 8pm.Although we did not use it, there appeared to be a very nice and clean (with table cloths) restaurant on the main floor, which usually served meals buffet style. On the other side of the lobby, a small bar (which we rarely saw anyone use).Although the hotel is very clean, neat, and well kept, probably the best thing about it is the location. It is very centrally located, minutes from the Beijing Subway and the Beijing Railway station. There are also a few western style eateries (McDonalds and KFC) within minutes walking distance. And right beside it, is a small Chinese eatery that features breakfast dumplings for those that like that for breakfast. Directly across the street is a small convenience store for snacks, soft drinks, etc"
30,40,"Mar 4 2008	Good location okay room	This place is nothing special to look at but is good value for money. It's clean and comfortable and in a pretty good location - walking distance to shopping and dining areas, and a cheap taxi ride to Forbidden City / Tianamen Square etc. Hotel has a tour agency in the building that can book all sorts of tours for you, however you can probably get cheaper by going to an independant place - we found an ad on a map and a got a private tour (car, English speaking guide, driver) for a lot less than the price to two people to go on a bus tour. Hotel restaurant is ok. reception staff speak good English and concierges will help you get a taxi as most drivers don't speak much English. They also give you a helpful card with the name and address of the hotel and main tourist in Chinese characters which you can use to show the tax driver where you want to go."
31,40,Mar 3 2008	Great Location in the Heart of Beijing	Stayed here for several nights in October 2007 and was very pleased. The staff were (for the most part) very accomodating. Rooms were clean and smartly appointed. The food in the restaurant was a real surprise -- good quality and value with a range of items. Staff assisted us with getting a cab for the day to the Great Wall. Location really can't be beat -- walking distance to the subway and Beijing's main railway station. You can also walk to Wangfujing and Tiananmen Square. There was a grocery store and several internet places very close by. The only drawback was that taxi drivers found it a challenge to locate the hotel. Have the name written in Chinese with you and have the driver call the hotel.Highly recommended for those travelling to Beijing on a budget.
32,40,"Feb 2 2008 	Great for the budget traveler!	I stayed at the Harmony in May 07. I was planning my own trip to China without a agency to try and save money. I expected a $35 a night hotel to be almost like camping but I thought I could live with that since I wouldn't be spending much time in the room. The location is across the street from the main train station but it far enough down a side street that it is quiet. Even though some reviews say that they did not like this, I felt safer than in most American cities except from &quot;human spam&quot; (people trying to sell you stuff, which is everywhere in China). The rooms are similar to what you would find in a &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; or similar chain. There is only a shower and not a tub, but that did not bother me at all. The beds were clean but, like every hotel in China, harder than American standard. The front desk employees spoke English very well and were helpful but not a concierge. One good thing was that they were not trying to sell you things, like I have seen in other Asian countries. The breakfasts were expensive by Chinese standards but not for American standards and I thought they were quite good. The in-room massages are inexpensive and wonderful after a day climbing the great wall. They did not seem at all to be like massages in Thailand which is just another word for &quot;special services&quot;. In all, I think this is a very affordable hotel and exceeded my expectations. If I ever go back to Beijing, I will be booking this hotel again."
33,40,"Dec 12 2007 	very well received very well treated...	Arrived by train at 6:00AM after 7 days on the Trans-Siberian and was wisked to my room by very friendly attentive staffer. Didn't have to wait for the 2:00pm check in. Wonderfully clean room, very nice breakfast buffet, and great locale, close to everything.I found an internet cafe around the corner at the hostel, used it everyday and was given a pass one day because my business was so short. Great little take out shop at the end of the parking lot...hot sandwiches yum. Beer in the honor bar cheaper than the super market. In house laundry was a bit pricey.Desk arranged tours and was eager to answer any and all questions. Would not hesitate to stay there the next time I am in Bejing.ps, If you are traveling by train to Bejing &quot;KEEP YOUR TICKET&quot;. I was stopped at the exit of the depot and asked to produce my Moscow to Beijing ticket stub. I don't know what would have happened if I couldn't and I'm glad I didn't have to find out!"
34,40,"Dec 6 2007 	nice little hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights from the 12 november 2007and i must say what a great hotel, staff were very friendly, roomswere comfortable and local was good. suppermarket was just over the road and a few shops round corner. little tip don't use the internet at hotel is a bit expensive (1 yan a min) if you come out the hotel and take a right then turn left and walk past shops then take a right they is a hostel they (rotating doors) use the net they is (4 yen for half hr) when you come out the youth hostel to head back to hotel if you look straight ahead the subway is they and very easy to use. also if your planning a trip to the terracotta warriors you leave from beijing west (30 mins drive from hotel) and not beijing station near hotel.if you fancy shopping turn left out of hotel bottom of road turn left again take subway to otherside of road walk straight up go over bridge and either walk round shopping mall or go through it and that takes you to the main shopping area (15-20 mins walk from hotel)"
35,40,"Oct 8 2007 	Great Value	We stayed in a deluxe room which was spacious. Besides a QS bed, which was firm and comfortable with comfortable pillows, there was a full size sofa and 3 easy chairs and 3 smallish tables. All the furniture was co-ordinated well and aesthetically pleasing. The lighting options in the room were excellent. The room had a TV, fridge and safe. The bathroom had a shower over the bath and plenty of hot water.The hotel is located in a moderately 'scruffy' street but is conveniently located near a supermarket and some convenience stores, fast food outlets and the train station and subway. However, taxis were so cheap and readily available we used them frequently. Dinner and breakfasts were nothing to get excited about but quite edible and value for money.We would stay there again and recommend it to our friends."
36,40,"Oct 3 2007 	Overall a good place to stay	The Hotel itself is ageing and needs renovation, but having said that the rooms were comfortable and were generally clean, so we had no complaints apart from the air conditioning whch just seemed to push air around no matter what temperature was selected. It wasnt too much of a problem at this time of year but you couldnt live with it in the Summer. There was a mini-mart across the road that sold cheap beer and wine should you want to buy some, and (if youre not eating in the Hotel restaurant) theres a restaurant behind the Hotel that we found to be fine (and cheap) and one of the waitresses spoke some English which helped. The Hotel staff seemed a bit tired so I guess they were working long hours, and getting service at the Hotel bar was almost impossible the night we tried as the bar person was working in the Hotel restaurant also. Theres a fair amount of construction going on around the area and I would guess that this Hotel will be either renovated or demolished at some stage in the next 2-3 years possibly, but there was no problems with construction noise. From here you could also walk to the shopping in Wangfujing Street for shopping"
37,40,"Sep 15 2007	Convenient hotel if arriving in Beijing by train	Overall, the Harmony Hotel is reasonable value. This hotel seemed to be popular with western tourists. The location is great if you are travelling to/from Beijing by train. The Beijing Train Station (Beijing Zhan) is only 5 minutes walk. It is also located close enough to Wangfujing St (Shopping) - 15 minutes walk and Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City - 25 minutes walk. You can catch the subway from Beijing Zhan to Tiananmen Square for 6RMB (5 minutes duration, 2 stops).It is a noisy hotel, there are people coming and going at all hours. This is one of the pitfalls of being close to the train station. There was also a new building under construction close by which added to the noise. The room size is ok and the facilities were in good condition.The breakfast here was disappointing and provided limited choice. The restaurant is small and was packed every time I visited (different time each morning). There is a small supermarket across the road and other places around the corner on the way to the train station as alternatives for breakfast.The level of English spoken was ok throughout, as long as you don't have any unusual requests. There is a massage place next door and it's a bit dingy. Before going here, I suggest you know enough Mandarin to explain clearly what you want. A massage is not necessarily a massage in China. Get help from a local if you don't know Mandarin. If you request a foot massage, expect to be led down a corridor to a back room with about 20 recliners occupied by Chinese men in boxer shorts having a cigarette and watching TV. A taxi from Beijing Airport to this hotel is around 90RMB. As always in China, have the hotel details available in Chinese for the taxi driver. I caught many taxis in Beijing and not one taxi driver knew where this hotel was based on saying the name alone, even in Mandarin."
38,40,"Sep 11 2007 	Really a pleasant stay!	We stayed at Harmony Hotel from the 14th to the 26th of August 2007. What a pleasant stay! We booked a deluxe room (but it's very cheap;-) and we were really satisfied with it as it is very spacious, confortable, bright and clean. Only the TV set didn't work very well. We had few times the breakfast at the hotel (it cost only 30 yuan) as we preferred to have it in our nice room (we bought food at the store just in front of the hotel that is open 24h or at the big store close to the metro station). The location is excellent: 3 minutes from Beijing central station and the metro station; a big store and a post office just around the corner and some typical hutong (alleys) around.We dined once at the restaurant in the hotel, good food and very cheap.We'll certainly choose again this hotel the next time we'll be in Beijing."
39,40,"May 24 2007 	Great value for money and excellent location	If I come back to beijing, I will stay here again. Perfectly located, close to a metro station and the main railway.Long walking distance of Tienamen Square.Large rooms, efficient service, quiet, close to a mall."
40,40,"May 12 2007	Try This One	This wasn't our first choice of hotel but we were very pleased with it and would definitely return to it. It's location near the subway meant it was very easy to get to many parts of the city. Even though taxis are cheap we realised that the traffic is so bad that subways save a lot of time. With the new subways this should be even better. This is the best hotel of this class that we have stayed in. There was plenty of space and the shower and toilet were in good knick. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The minibar prices were the cheapest e.g. Y5 for a bottle of beer. There was usually at least one staffmember who could answer questions in english. No tips were expected.There were plenty of shops nearby and in the hutong next to the hotel was a fantastic range of little food shops, especially fruit. Very little english spoken but lots of freshly cooked food and very cheap prices. This is noisy part of town with Beijing railway station and a postal exchange but we weren't bothered by the noise.The only query would be how the aircon would cope with the heat of summer. We had some warm spring weather which overwhelmed the room's unit even though it was as low as it could go. Luckily it wasn't a problem for us."
41,40,"May 9 2007 	Good basic hotel	This is a good affordable hotel, stayed twice on the same trip. First stay (4 nights) had a small, but clean room, clean carpet &amp; bathroom (standing showers only in standard room, not good if your really tall [6'4/195cm +] or very obese). Second stay (1 night) the carpet was a little dirt, but ok. Good room service (avg of 12 rmb - 35 rmb), front desk spoke english. On a busy side street, so you hear a lot of car horns in daytime, quiet at night (10pm-6/7am). Walking distance to subway, stores, Tiananmen Square, has restaurant/bar inside, but next to cheaper restaurants and markets. Good 3-star hotel for basic, affordable &amp; clean stays (a lot of foreigners there), but if your picky you may want to find a 4-star."
42,40,"May 4 2007	Not bad	I booked this hotel for a rate of US$50 through Asiahotels for a night in April. The hotel is basic, but with a decent location not too far from the Forbidden City and main shopping area. Good Chinese restaurant with reasonable prices. Limited bar but again good prices. This hotel is a good bet if you want a simple, clean room (with attached bathroom) and intend to spend a lot of time sightseeing."
43,40,"Apr 29 2007 	Convenient and Economical	I'm writing this review as I feel guilty that I have used the forum on multiple occasions but never contributed to it. This was our third hotel stay during our China trip. Our expectation for this hotel was low hoping that it would provide a clean and quiet room for sleeping as we are out the whole day and don't care for any extra amenities. We were not disappointed. The beds are very firm just like other hotels in China which is OK with us. We used the morning breakfast buffet serving the usual western and chinese fare for a reasonable price of 30RMB. The hotel is in a very convenient location for using public transportation to the airport, train station and the attractions in Beijing. Lot of cheap restaurants, fast food like Mcdonald, KFC etc and couple of 24 hr convenience stores around the area as it is across the train station. Could never get back to the hotel in time to have dinner but the menu seemed reasonable.The shower stall was small, about 3 sq ft, but what could be significant for some people is the fact that I had to go in side ways to fit thru the door which is about 1.5 ft and I weigh 150 pounds. The only hotel we stayed in where the water was really hot. House keeping was very good. Never turned the TV on.It is true that there is no good shopping around the area. If you are looking for knock off brandname merchandise there are two indoor shopping malls/markets which are easily accessible by taxi, bus or subway. Wagfujing area is a few subway stops away. Never had to spend more than 20RMB for taxi.We took the airport bus (exit door 11 once you clear immigration and customs and buy your ticket 16RMB and go to the bus stop #2 which is right across the ticket counter with the sign- Beijing Train station). Got off at the last stop after 1:15. The stop where you get off is a bit farther off than the stop you will get on to the bus to the airport). Walk about 5 minutes towards the train station (in the direction the bus is going/facing) upto the first cross walk. You will see the green hotel sign across the street to your left. You will pass the stop to go back to the airport just before you get to the cross walk. Obviously this will work if you can easily wheel your luggage as otherwise you may be at the mercy of the few taxi touts hanging around the bus stop.The Beijing Zhan Subway/Metro stop is just around the corner from the hotel across the train station and is a 5 min walk. 3RMB takes you any where on line 1 or 2 which is what you will need as of now but I'm not sure if this will change when the new lines open before the olympics. All signs and announcements (you actually hear them unlike chicago or New York trains) in chinese and english with very clear signs and maps. Felt very safe and secure unlike NY, Chicago, Spain or Italy.Plenty of buses if you know where they are going as the signs are in chinese and no one speaks english. Felt safe and secure but language was a problem.Single most useful thing we carried with us was a map with streets and attractions marked in english and chinese. You show the chinese script to almost any one and they point you in the right direction.I'll try to post on a different string about our other experiences including Beijing attractions, Shanghai and Suzhou as well as experiences with the people."
44,40,"Apr 11 2007	Great stay	After 6 days in the Trans Mongolian train I had a very pleasant stay in the Harmony Hotel. The location could not be more practical, very close to the train station. I had upgraded to luxury room for a few pounds per night more and had a incredibly large and luxury room. I can only recommend it.For cheap internet: go to the big Youth hostel on the left corner opposite the train station."
45,40,Mar 31 2007 	Didnt live up to reviews	Ok lociation was great But that was all this hotel has going for it!! I have stayed in some pretty average places in our travels but this is the worst!! We moved out after 2 days as i couldnt have my children stay there we moved to the Courtyard Marrott and spent the next 4 days in heaven!!
46,40,"Jan 26 2007 	Great Value	In a great location near the subway and main train station, with some great food stalls and restaurants in the surrounding streets/lanes. There is a mini -mart across the road as well as a large western style mall a block away. I am not usually a fan of eating in hotels but their restaurant is seriously good and excellent value. I am still dreaming of the fresh dumplings! We stayed there with our 6 month old baby and they provided a cot at no charge which a lot of chinese hotels do not offer. Would definately recommend this hotel as great value for money."
47,40,"Jan 16 2007 	Good budget hotel. Great location for Beijing train station	Stayed at the hotel for two nights in January at the end of my trip on the Trans-Mongolian railway. I wanted somewhere near the main train station and you can't get any nearer without being inside the station.This is a mid range to budget hotel, so expect that level of service and standards and you will be happy with your stay. If you want more, pay more (room cost 25 pounds a night!) and stay somewhere else. The staff spoke functional English and were as helpful as they were asked to be. The front doorman seems to go walkabout in the evening, so if security is a main concern this could be an issue. While you get a room card, people are free to come and go throughout the hotel and being this close to the station there's likely more traffic than they can keep track of. Didn't try either the bar or restaurant, but the restaurant seems to close quite early.The room was of standard size and clean. The bathroom counter and sink were nice, but the shower cubicle was more in line with hostel standards and the exposed pipes gave it a bad DIY feel.The location really is good. There's a shop right across the street which served as an unofficial room service for getting drinks and snacks. There are a number of cheap food alternatives there as well. The Beijingzhan metro stop is around the corner and the Chongwenmen metro station is 5 minutes walk. You can walk to Tiananmen square in 25 minutes by taking a right down Beijing Zhan Xijie and following it onto Qianmen Dongdajie. Conversely you can take the Metro from Beijingzhan to Quianmen (the previous reviewer saying you have to change trains and go to Tiananmen XI is just adding stops that don't need to be made). Unless its raining I'd also say its not too much to ask to walk to and from the Wangfujing shopping area.To find the hotel from Beijing Station:Come out the main entrance of the station and look across the street to your left and find the building with the China Post sign on it. There is also a McDonald's visible and lots of other shops and colourful signs. Simply cross the street and walk around the left hand corner (as seen with your back to the train station) of that building and you will see the Harmony Hotel if you don't spot the sign for it first. If it helps, one of my pics is looking back towards the station from the hotel.Airport Shuttle Bus from Beijing Station:If you want to take the shuttle bus to the airport (runs every 15 mins, approx 1 hour and 16Y) then from the hotel cross the road as if going back into Beijing railway station, but while facing the KFC take a right down the slip road. After 100 metres you should see the shuttle buses or at least the stand where they leave from. A cheap and simple alternative to taking a taxi. From the pic I have looking at the station you can see a bus parked there. Go 100 metres right of where that bus is to find the airport shuttle."
48,40,"Nov 4 2006 	Good Location very nice hotel	Close to one of the large shopping areas. Within 30 min walk of Tiannamen Sq &amp; Forbidden City (we are quite sporty). Hotel had very helpful staff. However, it's large and informal as you'd expect from a large chain. It did however suit our needs and we had a deal where our room was upgraded to deluxe and so was HUGE! especially in comparison to Hong Kong. When visiting attractions (leave early as better seen without the other hordes!)"
49,40,"Oct 29 2006 	Good location clean room good access to food	Room was very clean. Carpet and furniture appeared to be no more than 1 year old. The bathroom was clean but looked dated. Hotel staff were helpful - they helped us with the safe and shower knob issues within 10 mins and refused to accept tips. The lady at the reception was having a bad day when we checked it. She slammed down the phone after speaking with a colleague but was polite to us. LOCATIONHotel is a 2 min walk to the Beijing railway station and subway (Beijingzhan station). Hotel is location north of the station. A taxi ride to Chaoyang District (for shopping) costs 20 to 30 yuan. If you are going to Tiananmen Square, take a train to Tiananmen east station (you need to change train at jianguomen station). Subway tickets cost 3 yuan per ride per person. FOODThere are a number of good local and fast food eateries within a 2 min walk. As you walk from the hotel to the station (10m from hotel), you will see a shop with steaming buns and dumplings just next door to the hotel (not the one closest to the hotel) - delicious jiao zhi (dumplings) and buns (xiao long bao) for 3 yuan a basket (containing 10 each basket). Yummy!For good local dinner, follow the slip road in the right when you exit the hotel. There a shop with a picture of a mosque hung in the restaurant. It is a Chinese Muslim eatery. We had a large bowl of beef noodles (Nui Rou La Mian), 20 pieces of beef dumplings (jiao zhi), spicy beancurd skin fried with green peppers and a bottle of beer all for 20 yuan. Yummy!There are supermarkets and minimarts in the building opposite the hotel."
50,40,"Sep 13 2006 	Great location 	This hotel is in a perfect location, close to the train station, local shops and restaurants, and a hutong (fun to explore). It was close enough to the Forbidden City to walk to (20 minutes away). The hotel wasn't the most charming, but it was clean and welcoming, and the rooms were a decent size. It reminded me of Holiday Inns in the USA. I would definately stay here again. It was a great value at $46 per night."
51,40,"May 12 2006	Nicely priced well located clean hotel	This was an excellent hotel for the price . Would recommend for anyone .Well located - near Beijing railway station - Wangfujing and Tianamen only 15 mins walk away. Metro just around the corner at the station .Very clean nice sized rooms . The reception staff were very polite , spoke good English and very helpful .Good cheap supermarkets just across the road , I don't know why some people didn't like the location at night as it is perfectly safe ( as is most of China) , we walked back most nights . We even had a few drinks down the narrow backstreets close by , very late at night they were the only place open but very safe , cheap ( a beer was only 2 yuan ) and welcoming if you can communicate and if you don't mind the usual staring ."
52,40,"Mar 25 2006	Great value and very pleasant	I stayed at the Harmony for just under a week and was very happy with it indeed. This was my first trip to Asia and I was apprehensive that the language barrier would prove problematic, but luckily the desk staff all spoke good English and were friendly (and patient!). The room was fantastic and much bigger than I'd expected for the cheap price, with a double bed, large TV, wardrobe, fridge, mirrors, several cabinets, tea table and two comfy chairs. There was also a spacious tiled bathroom with shower and complimentary toothbrushes, combs, soaps and shampoo. It seemed very quiet, and I didn't notice any noise from either outside or inside the building.There are no tea and coffee facilities as such, but each day a large flask of boiling water was left with tea cups and jasmine tea bags - this stayed hot well into the night, and it was nice to have a refreshing drink like this available. The room was clean, and maid service was good. The TV had 50 or so Chinese channels, plus the English-language Chinese channel, CNN, and HBO, which was fine. After all, you don't go to Beijing to sit in your room and watch TV!Taxi drivers do find it hard to locate Harmony, but don't let this put you off. The address is listed as 59 Suzhou Hutong, but the main entrance to the hotel actually faces Youtong Street which I think is what causes the problem (also like most Chinese hotels the English name is different from the Mandarin, which in this case is &quot;Hua-mei-lun&quot;). Get the hotel staff to write for you in Mandarin &quot;please take me to Beijing station&quot;, which is literally a minute round the corner, and the taxi drivers will have no problem dropping you off there. There are also cards provided in the lobby, which say in English and Mandarin &quot;please take me to ...&quot; with a list of tourist sites in Beijing - these are very useful for showing to taxi drivers. Beijing taxis are wonderful, and ridiculously cheap. Short distances are all 10RMB (70p) and you can watch the meter go up in 7p increments when you travel further afield. I didn't find any taxi drivers who spoke English, but this doesn't matter if you can show them where you want to go on a card or a map. They're friendly and I always felt safe, which - as a single young woman - I can't say has always been the case in other countries! There are safety deposit boxes behind reception which I recommend you use, and are very safe as they're opened by one hotel key plus the key that they give to you. I was also delighted that they have adaptors for guests to use. When I asked for one at reception, I'd only just got up to my room when a cheery lady from housekeeping arrived with one, which was great. The buffet breakfasts are fine, and I ate at the hotel each morning as it was included in my stay. For the westerner there is cereal, eggs, fruit salad, coffee and perfectly decent croissants and jam. I recommend you also try some of the Chinese menu (just because you're abroad and you should!). The sweet biscuits and spring rolls are very nice, and there's also congee, which is a kind of bland but filling rice porridge. Right opposite the hotel there's a cavernous convenience store too, where you can buy water and other food for your room at very low prices.It's about a 20-25 minute walk to Wangfujing Street, Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, which is perfectly fine. If you don't feel like walking catch one of the hundreds of cabs trundling past, or you can take the subway round the corner on Jianguomennei (cheap and safe, with signs in English and clear maps). It's actually very easy to navigate in Beijing, as you can follow the straight N-S E-W roads to get pretty much anywhere, and roads are marked in both Mandarin and English. Look at a map as you're walking along the grid or are in your taxi, and you'll soon get to grips with it. It's an extremely safe city, and I didn't once feel concerned about walking alone, even after dark. The street lighting is good, and there are plenty of neon signs to guide you around! If you do get lost (which it would be pretty hard to do) just hail an ever-present taxi and wave one of the hotel's cards at them - they'll get you back to somewhere you recognise.Obviously you'll want to see Tiananmen, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall and the Temple of Heaven whilst in Beijing. I also recommend visiting the Lama Temple, and taking a stroll through some backstreet hutong just to get a feel for the place. Wangfujing is a fantastic for buying souvenirs, and although it's overpriced in comparison to what you can get elsewhere it's still very cheap for Westerners. The added bonus is that by shopping on Wangfujing you'll get staff who speak English, and hopefully avoid the pressure and clamour of &quot;hello lady!&quot; that the street vendors greet you with. All the same it's fun to venture off into side streets to barter and see what's for sale.Food in Beijing is fantastic. If you don't speak Mandarin then your choice will be more limited, but look out for the places with picture menus (so you can point!) or English menus and you'll be fine. I was lucky enough to be with Chinese friends who helped explain menus to me, but there seem to be plenty of restaurants with English text too. Again, eating out is very cheap. If you're a little nervous at first, head to the Oriental Plaza (walk west along Jianguomen until it's crossed by Dongdan and you'll see the enormous glittering complex). There's some stunning food here, with stylish Chinese, Japanese and Thai restaurants (plus English menus). I had a couple of meals here and they were amazing, although more pricey than elsewhere... all the same, even the most expensive dinner was only 7 per head, which you'd easily pay for one dish in the UK! Lastly, it seems to take about 30-60 minutes to get to Harmony from the airport (and vice versa) depending on the traffic, and you should expect to pay around 100 or so RMB for the trip depending on the taxi. The hotel booked me a very nice car to take me there for 150 RMB - it was obviously a top-end taxi and as it was my last day I couldn't be bothered to haggle him down. On the way into Beijing a guy approached me offering to drive me in for 485RMB, which I managed to barter down to 120 (which I was particularly pleased with!). Again though it was an expensive private taxi, and I'm sure you could travel there for less in the ordinary red city taxis.I would definitely recommend this hotel, and Beijing, as a tourist destination. It was an incredibly positive experience coming here, so if you're heading for China enjoy your stay!"
53,40,"Jan 26 2006	Above average hotel in great location	Great location around corner from underground and Beijing Rail Station. Smallish, clean, comfortable rooms. Hairdryer available for 50CNY deposit. English speaking staff. 15 min walk to Tianamen Square if you're keen or 2 stops on the underground. Great dumplings just outside hotel - turn right out of hotel, cross carpark and side street to first little place on the corner. Small supermarket opposite the and around the corner as well.

1,42,Amazing time in Beijing	Whilst in Beijing i had realised i had booked the wrong Hilton back in the UK. Instead of the hilton near the imperial palace i had booked this hotel. Initially being cross with this mistake the anger went out the window once we had arrived at Hilton Beijing. The hotel was amazing! the staff were so friendly and attentive without being overbearing which is sometimes the case in 5 star hotels. Will deffinately return when back in Beijing
2,42,"Nov 13 2009 	Another consistently great stay at the Beijing Hilton	I had a one night layover at PEK before a flight to Nanjing the next day. I chose this hotel mainly from the experiences of the last 3 stays there. It did NOT disappoint. From check in, the automatic upgrade in regard to my Diamond status to the Executive tower, the free bottle of wine and cookies plus welcome letter in my room, the awesomely quiet and comfortable room, the Executive lounge with it's great food, service, and checkin/out service, to the bell stand eager to help with a taxi or directions. Once again, this property stands as a flagship of Hilton customer service training and ethic, to which I would gladly refer other hotels take a course from."
3,42,"Nov 10 2009 	excellent hotel: good food 	* nice large room* friendly staff* many good restaurants in the hotel* good breakfast* hotel organises tourist trips with guides in groups of max. 8 &gt; these are super, only negative thing here is that they oblige you to visit commercial things like factories or shops during the tour (they have some kind of agreement with these commerces)* you can order a cheap taxi at the hotel &gt; to the centre EUR 3* don't order the hotel's airport shuttle car service &gt; regular taxi is 75% cheaper."
4,42,"Oct 30 2009 	Fantastic hotel	My husband and I inadvertently ended up staying here due to the Hilton Wangfujing being closed for three days over the 60 years of Communist rule celebrations. However, we were more than happy with this hotel.The location is a bit far away from the big tourist attractions but there is a subway station two minutes away which is easy to navigate, clean and cheap. On the plus side, it is close to the Lufthansa Centre, a Starbucks and a fantastic expat supermarket.Rooms are fairly standard but clean and certainly nothing to complain about. Staff are incredibly friendly and very helpful. Excellent standard of English.Breakfast is a standard hotel breakfast, but again nothing to complain about."

Room service was usual medium-high prices with solid food. Internet is a bit expensive. The gym is very big with good equipment, with a slightly dated feel. Breakfast was very good but the restaurant was so full that there was a wait -- not convenient especially if there for business and in a rush. Service was excellent at reception; staff were harried in the restaurant. Overall a very nice stay. I would consider going back, but Beijing has far too many nice boutique hotels (I stayed at the Hotel G for 2 nights and it was fantastic)."
8,42,"Sep 14 2009 	Old vs New	I stayed at this Hilton about 10 years ago and was concerned about staying at the hotel again. The renovations made to this hotel for the Olympics proved pleasurable and impressive. Being a Diamond HH member I was upgraded to the executive wing. I was impressed with the entire executive lounge services and the hotel room was fantastic. This executive lounge is like an entire hotel with a large atrium. My guess, however, is that the older wing of the hotel is not as impressive. I suggest trying to upgrade if at all possible.During the entire stay I was pleased with the service at the restaurants, front desk and bars. If you are adventurous and head out on your own and hope to take a taxi back to the hotel I suggest that you carry a map of the city with the hotels location clearly marked for the taxi driver to see and understand. The card provided by the hotel was not enough for many taxi drivers. The hotel is a main hotel in Beijing, but taxi drivers seem inept in finding their way around the city. And, be cautious as many drivers will attempt to charge a foreigner 8 to 10 times more than they charge a local.I would stay at this hotel again."
9,42,"Aug 11 2009 	What a Trip!	Before resigning from my position as a flight attendant, my husband &amp; I traveled to China for the 1st time and had an unbelievable time! The Hilton is a great place to stay! From the clean rooms to the english cards that directed taxi drivers to your destinations (my sister speaks Mandarin but I do not...), to the friendly staff, our trip was wonderful. Our visits to the Pearl Market, Forbidden City, The Great Wall, even McDonalds (LOL) made our trip to China a truly unforgetable experience for us!We hope to return to Beijing again someday and will definitely stay at the Hilton!"
10,42,"Jul 25 2009 	Good Hotel -	My husband and I used Hilton Points and stayed at this hotel after I completed some business in Beijing. We had the pleasure of also staying at the Hilton Wanfujing before my business. We liked both hotel. The Hilton Wangfnujing is newer Hilton and we liked the rooms, health club and service better than the Beijing Hilton. The Beijing Hilton is certainly a very nice hotel. I can't speak for the &quot;old&quot; tower, but we stayed in the newer round executive tower and the rooms were lovely. The bathrooms are huge with a big tub, flat screen TV over the tub, large shower with rain head, and many nice amenities. The closet was huge and a few drawers for putting up clothes. We did visit the health club and were disappointed. The women's locker room was old, smelled musty, and the very large jacuzzi had been covered over to make a bed??? Strange. The steam shower was not hot. She dry sauna was nice and hot, however, The Executive Lounge was nice, but not nearly the selection of the Wangfujng Hilton Exec Lounge. The location was good at the Beijing Hilton especially since we were doing some shopping at YaShow Market and had to go back and forth to have fittings on some clothes we were getting made. I would highly recommend either hotel!"
11,42,"Jul 11 2009 	Echoing what the others said: Great Hotel (and adding some practical tips)	I can not disagree with the others. I stayed in executive tower and enjoyed my visiti to Beijing. Typical Hilton experience and even more. Here are my practical tips:Subway is good (cheap and fast) way to reach the city attractions (Olympic sports center, Tiananmen and frobidden city, Sanlitun, temple of heaven).: Liangmaqiao station is only one block south from the hotel. Close to Lianmaqiao station you can also experience western-style shopping in Lufthansa center mall (real items - high price). A bit different experience is bargaining in the mall (i do not recall the name) opposite of Kunlun hotel, close to northwest exit of Liangmaqiao station. Remember to not pay for too much for items that probably are not real: price for Abercrombie/Ralph Lauren Polo is 30-40 CNY, not 300 as they might suggest to you. Same applies to almost every item in this mall (Sunglasses, sneakers,...)If you have time, Great wall is worth visiting. You can negotiate a taxi-trip to wall. It will cost 500-800 CNY, Taxi driver will take you there and wait until you have seen it. The hotel staff will help you in negotiating the deal."

13,42,"Apr 7 2009 	Good if you are booking via internet and paying next to nothing...	I wrote a review about this hotel a few years ago after I had an unexpectedly positive experience. Just stayed again for 1 night, and can unequivocally state that the hotel now resembles what one would expect from Hilton, which be clear, is an incredibly mediocre hotel. Room: Premier Suite, #2215, Cost: 2,800 rmb per nightPositives- Bellmen, Concierge and Check-in staff were all very niceNegatives- Hot water never became hot - only lukewarm;- Toiletries were &quot;half-full&quot; upon check-in. Sorry if this seems petty but at what translates to about usd 400 per night in China, I expect everything to be fully re-stocked;- Internet usage requires a fee. Come on, are you kidding me?- No executive lounge. They built a new tower and thus have shut-down the old executive lounge on the 22nd floor. Now, they require that you go down to the lobby, walk across the lobby to the new wing, go up the elevator to another executive lounge to eat your breakfast. I told them that it was far easier to leave the hotel for breakfast...and I did! Right after checking out 3 days early.In summary, this hotel is probably best for those who really don't expect much from a hotel because they are paying next to nothing for the room (ie internet booking). If you are accustomed to paying high prices for hotel suites and being catered to, you will not like this hotel a single bit."
14,42,"Apr 6 2009 	Good functional hotel	Great location - helpful staff, most of who speak some degree of English. Rooms are modern. If possible stay at the Executive wing, which has many free ammenities including a great breakfast buffet and a tempting cocktail hour. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant is a treat as well."
15,42,"Feb 18 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel last May during our trip to China. This is an amazing hotel with unbelievable service. The rooms are exquisite! The Executive Lounge is very accomodating after a long day of traveling with a wonderful staff. We highly recommend staying here!To see pictures from our trip, check out my website www.svadlenak.com"
16,42,"Dec 5 2008	Great Staff Great Service Great Stay!	What a great first stop on a two week tour throughout China! I was traveling with a group so the hotel was pre-selected but I would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Beijing in the future. The staffs command of the English language was the best I experienced in China and like all other Chinese even if there were communication challenges, they were completely gracious and helpful.Prior to my arrival, I was in contact with the concierge (April) regarding a nearby spa (Dragonflywhich I highly recommend) as well as some other things to do in my free time. She was extremely professional, helpful and very prompt with responses. While at the hotel, the concierge staff was unbelievably helpful! They provided me a great deal of local information (outside of my group activities) and made reservations for me at Dragonfly without trying to force the hotel spa on me. I did take advantage of the hotels spa services upon my arrival as my 13 hour flight ended up being closer to 15 hours and I just wanted something where I didnt have to leave the hotel. I opted for the in-room massage which I would definitely not recommend if youre more accustom to in-home massages like we have in the States. Rather than bringing a table and sheets, the therapist had me lay directly on the bed (after having worked in hotels for 10 years, the last thing you want to do is lay directly on the comforterwhich I promptly removed before the massage). It was here that I also discovered the Chinese have a different sense of modesty than we do in the States as the therapist stands in front of you just waiting on you to disrobe and unlike our massage therapists, they arent real concerned about covering your body during the massagethank goodness for that towel from the bathroom!! One of the best parts of traveling is discovering the differences in cultures and customs but sometimes you do find yourself missing your customs as youre lying naked on a bed in front of a perfect stranger while they are straddling you.As this was our first night in Beijing, our tour company had a welcome reception for us at the hotel. The food and service were fabulous. Nothing like real dumplings and a cold Chinese beer to welcome you!Upon returning to my room after the reception, I was hit in the face with a very hot and stuffy room. I checked the heat and it was off and since it was winter, the air conditioner was stuff off by the hotel. I tried to open the window but for some reason, the window was sealed shut so I called down to the front desk. They promptly sent up someone from Engineering and he tried to open the window but couldnt. After asking my permission to use my phone (very nice touch), he called the front desk and had them transfer me to a new room. Shortly the bellman was at my door to help me movetalk about quick response!While my first room was nice, my second room was even better. Apparently my first room had not been renovated (but other than the different furniture, I would not have known as the room was in excellent condition). These pictures are from my second room. The room was very spacious with a great desk and separate sitting area. As someone who cannot stand to be hot especially when sleeping, the best part was the window opened!!The bed was unbelievably comfortableI do wish US hotels would go with the duvet concept. Loved having the tea pot in my room as Im a big tea drinker and so thrilled to have a selection of English news channels so I could stay on top of what was happening around the world. The bathroom was lovelyfabulous big tub as well as the shower. The bathroom amenities covered everythingthe only thing of mine I used was my flat iron and brush as they literally provide everything you could possibly need in a bathroom. As the water in China is not drinkable, the hotel provided two bottles of complimentary water each time they serviced your room (which was at least twice a day).We had breakfast each morning in the hotels restaurant as it was included in our package. The selection of food was unbelievable! Other than Sunday Brunch at the Waldorf in New York or on the Queen Mary in California, I have honestly never seen so much food on a breakfast buffet! They had everything from pastries to fruit to all the Western breakfast items to traditional Chinese food. Until now, I had never tried watermelon or cucumber juicedont know Ill ever have them again but I did get to try itas well as dragonfruitnot much taste but a funky texture.Again, the hotel service was wonderful and very attentive. The hotel was located in a safe area and I felt completely comfortable walking around in the eveningthe US Embassy was actually right around the corner. I would definitely recommend this hotel for those traveling to Beijing."
17,42,"Nov 29 2008 	Nice. Just watch the price of the cappuccino	Close to the city center and very nicely appointed, having been recently renovated. Slightly noisy due to the main roads in close proximity but I wouldn't let that put you off because it's the case for many hotels in the center. The staff are nice - seemed to be finding their way in some respects - but well intentioned. Just be aware of the very high prices on things like coffees and drinks, which are even more disproportionate to local prices than other cities.Overall, I'd stay here again - but I'd probably lean more towards the China World Hotel, which has a more extensive breakfast and is walking distance to the Silk Road shopping center."
18,42,"Nov 20 2008 	Good Stay Almost :)	Such a nice Stay , I spend like 9 Days in this Hotel and here is my Review : Location : Very nice district near the airport but away from the main Shopping Streets / Malls , you will need a taxi to reach them , or a Taxi to the nearest Subway . District is like a business centre , very clean but full of ppl @ night asking you if you need massage . There is some constructions going on , in the area next to the hotel so you might hear them if you are in a lower floor , I recommend you choose a higher floor . Breakfast : So Nice ..Almost Everything is there , Omlet , Cheese , Meat , Chicken , Bakery . Chinese Food . Room : Very nice and clean , Bathroom is so nice also . I liked it ."
19,42,"Nov 18 2008 	Great Location - attentive staff	We recently stayed at the Beijing Hilton. We were there for meetings. The location was very close my husbands business meetings so he could walk directly from the hotel.You can actually see the Forbidden City from our hotel room. We did walk back from Forbidden City but it was a bit of a walk.There are lots of shopping and dining oppty right outside the hotel. It really is a great location. There is a multi-level shopping mall right next doorThe hotel has several restaurant options but I think we ate dinner out most evenings.The fitness center actually opened the day before we arrived and even the Executive Lounge was moved into its permanent location while we were there.Most of the times, it seemed that we were the only ones using the fitness center and Executive Lounge.The room was very large. It had a totally separate closet area. The toilet and shower stalls were enclosed separately in smoked glass. There was a large soaking tub next to the wash basin area. and then you finally got to the bedroom area, that had a desk/lounge area as well as the king-size bed. Flat screen tv. The room had the usual amenities; robe, safe, internet, coffee/tea and an extra large mini bar - it was as large as a reg. size refrigerator :-)The staff was soooo attentive. Even the bellmen in/outside of the hotel entrance would make sure when you left the grounds you were taken care of and that you knew which way to head and made sure to always speak with the taxi drivers. Everytime I left the grounds they would give me a card that was in english and chinese to give to the taxi drivers so I could get back to the hotel or the taxi driver could call them for directions. They really made you feel care for.I would stay there again anytime! Enjoy"
20,42,"Nov 5 2008 	Very good 5 star Hotel	The room was newly refurbished, the bed was excellent.There was a nice pool and also two squash courts.Very good place for the trips to the city, you are there with the taxi in about 5 minutes."

22,42,"Sep 6 2008 	Beijing ... you should stay here when you are in Beijing	I staid in many Hotels in Beijing, but I liked the Hilton most.

23,42,"Jun 26 2008 	Nice hotel	Just stayed one night in the hotel and wanted to be close to the airport. It's clean, comfortable and the service is excellent. The rooms were very nice as well as the bathrooms. Breakfast was a little expensive ($30 USD), but the selection was amazing. I would stay there again, but only for short stays, as it seems somewhat inconvenient to get to the city center of Beijing."
24,42,"Jun 18 2008 	No mango shake no stay.	Hilton hotels are never impeccable but always decent. But, this one was a disaster, in my experience.The exterior was under construction, so arriving on a raining day was a &quot;yuck&quot; first impression. Then the front desk woman had an attitude. The room and bathroom were small. THE LUGGAGE BENCH HAD A VISIBLE LAYER OF WHITE DUST which was unacceptable. Finally when I went to one of the hotel restaurants, the staff couldn't accommodate my simple request. I asked them to not use the ginger in the &quot;mango shake with honey and ginger&quot;. The waitress said she had to check with the chef, and then told me &quot;the chef said we can't do it b/c it won't be the same drink any more&quot;. I told her I would take full responsibility for the drink being &quot;unoriginal&quot; or whatever it would turn out to be, BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED. She then had to check with the manager, and returned to tell me &quot;our manager said you should maybe order the orange juice instead&quot;. I was stunned but was really in the mood for a mango shake. So I ordered the mango shake with the ginger. I then packed my stuff and left in a hurry. You might think it's funny that I left a hotel for a mango drink. But it's the principle of it that I can't tolerate. In the capital city of China where thousands of new and existing hotels are competing for the summer Olympic customers and beyond, there is no need to put up with anything that's below satisfactory.BTW, the Marriott West hotel in Beijing that I moved to was a hidden gem. Beautiful French decor. Amazing city view if you get a nice room. And, great service!"
25,42,"May 18 2008 	Way to Go in Beijing	Stayed for 4 days in March, and will stay again when I go to Beijing. This is a perfect hotel for business, couples, and families with kids. The hotel is near shopping, and not too far from the center of Beijing. The rooms are new, the service is impeccable, and the hotel manager is one of the best I have seen in China so far. The hotel looks small upon arrival, however the foyer is grand. Enjoy a night cocktail in their bars. In Beijing this hotel is a great for the price."
26,42,"Feb 8 2008 	Good hotel on right side of town for airport	I stayed here for 5 nights on business. I was not on the executive floor but my room was well equipped and spacious. The bathroom is well equipped and spacious also with good toiletries. The temperature outside was below freezing for the duration of my stay but the rooms, bars and restaurants were all cosy. If you sit too near the door in the lobby you will be blasted by icy air every so often though. The food and service was good but the more expensive restaurant and bar were very empty and therefore pretty soul-less. Breakfast was very good with a choice of Chinese and western food. I would certainly return."
27,42,"Feb 7 2008 	Amazing service	Staff was unbelievably attentive and helpful. We stayed on the concierge level complimentary with our Hilton Hhonors membership which is food and drinks pretty much all day long. If you are a light eater than can save you on some dinners. The concierge staff were always accomodating and pleasant to talk to. The hotel and rooms were extremely clean. Hotel lobby was modern and high class. Turndown service, robe, and slippers were a nice touch. The rooms were standard small size with Crabtree and Eveyln products outfitted in marble, with a large tub and separate shower. It had an fancy coffee machine as well as the usual teas and nice oversized closets. The gym was well fitted with racquetball courts and a good sized indoor pool. The staff sets up the machines and gets you drinks, brings you towels. The bar is great...lots of people watching and fun drinks. Breakfast buffet was a highlight. The food was fresh, delicious, and in abundant selection. We never had a problem taking a taxi as they have door people abundant who hail the taxis and let them know where you are going. We made sure to get the written name and address of the place from the hotel concierge as well as kept a card &amp; map with the Hilton's address for the return ride. Also make sure the taxi drivers use the meter. Taxis were not very expensive between $3 nearby -$7half hour ride. Took a group tour for the Great Wall but they make alot of stops at &quot;factories&quot; where they give you a tour then sell the items at a large markup. If your short on time or these stops annoy you go with a private tour. Make sure to try a Peking Duck restaurant...it is amazing."
28,42,"Feb 5 2008	The HIlton Beijing	The Hilton Beijing is a marvelous facility with excellent staff. The service, the food, and the rooms are great. Also, when something does not go according to plan, they work hard to make it right. We stayed there for a total of five nights in January 2008 and would not hesitate to stay there again.ENJOY!"
29,42,Feb 2 2008 	Tries hard.........	Stayed over a weekend. It was cold and the lobby was too chilly to stay and sit down which is a problem as this is where the cafe and one of the bars are. So if you just want to hang out there is nowhere to do this is except the executive floor. The rooms were nice and the staff tried very hard and were helpful. I didn't like the gym at all. The food was OK but expensive. I will try somewhere else next time.

31,42,Dec 21 2007 	All good(ish)	Stayed here on a work trip and found it a pleasant place to stay for 4 nights. The food for breakfast was great with loads of choice of hot and cold dishes.The rooms are of a high standard and kept very clean.Service in all the bars is tip-top.Prices in the restaurant are expensive but I guess you expect this.Not the best location to be honest as it's not really at the exciting parts of town but as taxis are SO cheap by UK standards that's not really a problem.Staff are uber-friendly.My only gripe would be to check your bill at check-out time for odd items from the mini-bar. I hadn't used mine and in my delirious early departure didn't notice some items had been added.
32,42,"Nov 30 2007 	Fine Hotel But Not a Great Locale	Great, professional check-in and courteous service.My room was an upgrade from a King Deluxe because of high occupancy - it was well-appointed, clean and comfortable. I really like the storage/closet system and the bathroom was spacious and nice.The buffet breakfast was pretty good - there was a lot to choose from and of high quality.As much as I like this hotel's rooms and service, the location is bad; I tend to like it if there are a few places within walking distance and the Hilton Beijing really only has the Lufthansa Center (a high-end mall) close by. Still, one can keep in mind that taxis in Beijing are everywhere and realtively cheap (if I remember correctly, Tiananmen Square is about a $6-7 USD and the airport is less than $10)."
33,42,"Nov 21 2007	Great Location	The Hilton Beijing is a 5-star hotel in a central location for tourists and business. The rooms are clean, but a but smaller than the Intercontinental. Service was excellent. Upgrading to Executive Suites is well worth it as you will get complimentary full bar happy hour and breakfast."
34,42,"Nov 16 2007 	Service with a Smile and in crystal clear English	I used hilton's Going Global promotion, using 150,000 hhonros points for 6 nights. As a Diamond Member, I received 5-star treatment, even though I was not paying for the room in &quot;hard currency&quot;.The executive lounge and gym are some of the very best I have seen within the Hilton Chain.The free beverages, including top shelf cocktails, were served by very attentive servers. Breakfast and Happy hour included hot foods that make a full meal, if needed. We arrived late afternoon, and were tired from the long flight. By the time I had a few beers, an the hot offerings, I did not need to go anywhere but to my room, which made for an easy first night in Beijing.I tried to check-in at the main reception desk in the lobby, but was encouraged to use the desk on the 22nd floor's Exec lounge.(it is very nice to have a beer in hand, while signing-in) The Manager on Duty was so helpful and welcoming. My room was beautiful (see photos) and very comforable, with tons of ammenities.I was on holiday, but I had accrued my HHonors points through work-related travel. This hotel is mainly geared towards business, but It made for a great vacation. If I come back to Beijing on business, I will be staying here."
35,42,"Oct 23 2007	Near the downtown	The hotel is beside 3rd Ring Road, and is very near Luf Shopping Mall. It's convinient. To the south of the hotel is CBD. Most Fortune 500 companies stay in CBD."
36,42,"Oct 13 2007	Wonderful Hotel in Beijing	This hotel easily deserves a 5-star rating on TripAdvisor. I stayed here for 8 nights on business, and was amazed by the consistently great service. Internet is lightning fast, the gym is all you need (there are even squash courts and an indoor pool). If you are a Gold/Diamond HHonors member, the Executive lounge is wonderful - free snacks all day, from fresh sushi to smoked salmon to good cheeses. And the happy hour has any/all drinks.The rooms aren't large, nor small, but very well furnished. I had a large glass shower and a separate bath, with a tv in the bathroom if you decide to take a bath and watch some CNN.The location is a quick taxi drive along the ring road to the business district. The restaurants are good, and the buffet at Elements is actually a good value for a hotel buffet.But the service was just perfect - always willing to help with anything. Everyone speaks at least decent english, which is helpful in a city where most people don't speak english at all.I strongly recommend this hotel."
37,42,"Sep 5 2007 	Expensive but good quality	The Hilton Beijing is a top-end hotel in the Chaoyang area of Beijing.(1) Neighborhood(I'm actually copying this section from another hotel review that I wrote because the two hotels are near each other and the information is exactly the same.)The Hotel is realtively close to the airport -- about 25 minutes, assuming good traffic conditions. (Beijing is urban sprawl hell, so this is a good location if you want to be close to the airport.) A taxi from the airport should cost about Y$75 (about US$10). The hotel is located in the Chaoyang neighborhood, but there's really not much to see within walking distance. There are a number of embassies located nearby, a street called &quot;Super Bar&quot; for nightlife, and a decent mall, all within walking distance. The neighborhood was perfectly acceptable, if lacking in major siteseeing opportunities. The hotel has a taxi stand, and taxis are relatively inexpensive (at least to NYC standards). The hotel is not close to any subway stations.(2) Check-In / Check-OutCheck-in and check-out are very smooth. The employees speak fantastic English and are polite and helpful. There's also a service for checking out the night before you leave. There's always multiple people in the lobby to help you with anything you need. A concierge service can confirm airline bookings and other things.(3) PriceMy friend and I paid US$187/night for a room with two beds.(4) RoomsThe rooms are great. Extremely comfortable beds, mattresses, and sheets. There's lots of space to spread out, with a desk, multiple closets, and comfortable chairs.The bathroom was large with separate shower stall and bathtub. There are plenty of towels and bathrobes are included in the room.The quality of the room was more than &quot;good,&quot; though I'm not sure I would rate it as excellent, only because it didn't have too many &quot;extras.&quot;One slight annoyance: A maid tried to clean our room at 8:30 am on a Saturday morning. We had bolted the door, so she realized that we hadn't left yet for the day, but in a luxury hotel, the staff really should know better than to wake people up early on a weekend.(5) Other AmenitiesComputers with internet access are available on the 3rd floor for Y$3/minute. This is about US$24/hour. Quite honestly, this was the most expensive price for use of a computer with internet access that I found anywhere in China. I'm aware that this is a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel with business clientelle and expense accounts to burn, but US$24/hour is a rip-off, plain and simple, and no amount of &quot;luxury&quot; can justify this price. There was internet service available in the room, but we didn't have a computer.The room includes 2 free bottles of water and a huge delicious apple every day, along with cloth napkin and a knife. 1 Liter of Evian is available for sale for Y$60. (As a comparison, the other hotel we stayed at in this neighborhood sold Evian for Y$30, and a nearby store sold it for Y$18.)Every evening, there was live music at the front of the hotel. Nice and relaxing after a long day.Guests have free use of a gym in the hotel. The staff at the gym seemed like they wanted to actually show me how to use the equipment before I told them that I knew what I was doing.(6) ConclusionThis is a top-end business-class hotel, located close to the airport. There are many amenities and luxuries, and the service is top-notch. Perhaps that's also my main complaint: I don't really need or desire this type of luxury while travelling. (I was staying here because my travelling companion wanted a few nights at a top-end hotel.) As a result, I found the extremely expensive internet service to be almost usurious.Despite that, however, I'll say that this hotel does give value for the money. The service really is fantastic, and there's a bit of pampering involved. The lobby is gorgeous, and the cafes in the lobby are the kinds of places where you can easily greet business clients. The rooms are extremely comfortable and will most certainly result in a good night's sleep. The employees are courteous and helpful. It's a good place, especially if you're looking for much more than just a basic place to sleep for the night."

39,42,"Aug 14 2007 	Great gym	Stayed at the hotel for business reasons. Not only were all of the staff helpful, but has a great gym. I saw the construction mentioned by other reviewers, but it didn't bother me. Perhaps I was on the &quot;non-noisy&quot; side of the hotel."
40,42,"Aug 6 2007 	Good Hotel but noisy construction next door	I recently stayed at the Beijing Hilton and while impressed with the hotel, the construction next door was loud. The workers worked until after midnight.I asked to be moved but was told there were no more rooms. Half the hotel faces this construction so I guess it would be hard to move everyone.The room was nice though but had an odd odor. The bed was very nice. Once the construction stopped I slept well. The bathroom was roomy with both a bath and stall shower.A fuse blew in my room and I will commend the hotel for getting it fixed right away. It looks like they had had this problem before as when I checked in the door to the fuse box was open.If I was on the other side of the hotel my review would have been a whole lot better. The rest of the service was exceptional and the buffet was excellent."

This would be a good option for foreigners who crave a bit of Western comfort.Rooms are clean, modern, comfortable with all the ammenities such as robe/slipper, well-stocked beverages and snacks, safe. Bathroom is large with plenty of room for two people. Bedding was extremely comfortable and slept well.Room service was excellent...there are many restaurants in the hotel and we ate several meals in-room. The location requires taxi rides to other locations but taxi fares are not expensive (make sure you choose a taxi that has a working meter or else you will haggle a price once you arrive at your destination).The staff was excellent...they speak very clear English, are friendly and attentive."
42,42,"Jul 19 2007 	Great Hotel Great service	The service at the Beijing Hilton was excellent in every area, and available 24/7. Myself and my family felt very comfortable at the hotel while visiting a new city and a different culture. (on business and holiday). Everyone made us feel welcomed. House keeping was excellent and responsive. Rooms were comfortable, clean. Quiet at night. Great bathroom, big tub to soak in and separate shower. Great beds. The staff were wonderful. Anticipating needs and providing excellent service without being solicitous. Friendly and kind, very good english. Staff and travel desk did a great job with helping in-country travel arrangements. Always making sure we understood the issues and answered all our questions or pointed us in the right direction. A wonderful staff that should make Hilton proud to have. Concierge desk always made sure we could get somewhere and get back. A home away from home. Highly recommended."
43,42,"Jun 25 2007 	Enjoyable Stay at the Hilton Beijing	My spouse and I stayed 4 nights at the Hilton Beijing using hotel points. Overall we were impressed by the level of service and quality of the room and would recommend the hotel. Unfortunately, there was one significant negative: the location. The hotel is just beyond the entrance to the third ring road so it was either a U-turn to go into the city or a double U-turn to get on the highway to see outside the city sites (Great Wall, Summer Palace, etc.). The traffic in Beijing is quite bad all day through about 9 pm at night (It took 45 minutes to get to the Temple of Heaven leaving at 10:15 am). One day, we took a taxi just to the subway to save time and it still took over 15 minutes. Maybe when the new subway lines are available, one will reach this area.More specific information about our visit:- Check in was pleasant and easy. There was a welcome food tray and a bottle of wine in the room. They did not upgrade our room but we did have access to the Executive Lounge on the 22nd floor for free breakfast (cereal, eggs, limited dim sum, cheese, fruit, pastry, excellent smoked fish), happy hour, and wireless internet (also available in the lobby) which we did not expect.- Room decor was simple but in good condition - not flashy or exotic but more a classic style. We had some extra luggage because this vacation was an add-on after a business trip but there was room for 2 large and 4 smaller bags. Bath had a nice shower, large tub, room for two at the sink area (single sink) and lighted magnifying mirror although lighting overall could have been brighter.- Best thing about the hotel was the service level - called for laundry pickup and someone was there within 3 minutes, concierge called restaurants/shops to get directions and then went out to the taxi to explain, never a wait for a taxi, we wanted sandwiches to take with us to the Great Wall and the snack shop in the lobby called to get the sandwiches delivered 10 minutes early so we could depart on time. Everyone had a friendly demeanor, spoke decent English and had a service-oriented attitude.A very good hotel overall but plan on extra travel time given its location."
44,42,"Jun 21 2007 	Rennovation really improved the hotel!	Just spent two days at this hotel that just finished a major renovation. I am a pretty loyal Hilton hotel user; this hotel was the best I have stayed! Quality is far greater than typical Hiltons in the U.S., and quality level (room amenities, bathrooms (lcd in bath tub area), bedding, common areas) approaches a Ritz level. Workout facilities are the best of any hotels I have recently stayed, and on par with the recently remodeled Ritz Carlton Laguna Niguel. Services levels are very good, and Hilton has done a good job staffing English speaking employees. Definitely request the VIP 22nd floor club level; full service breakfast, drinks, wireless internet and late night drinks snacks at no cost were all greatly appreciated. VIP was not quite like the club levels of Ritz, but close with no extra charges (like Renaissance). Highly recommended!"

46,42,"Apr 11 2007	Good stay	I stayed for a week last november. Staff members are very professional and speak English quite well. Rooms are comfortable and the washrooms are large. Breakfast (not included in the room price) is very good (you can choose among Chinese, Japanese, European and American food). Price is good in comparison to European standard."
47,42,"Jan 17 2007	fantastic	styayed for 6 nights, airport pick up was waiting on arrival, room was fantastic exec suite, great lounge with complimentary drinks etc all day. staff were helpful. we were conserned initially that location was to far out it was not a problem as beijing is HUGE so no matter where you stay you will need to take very inexpansive cabs $5 aud to forbidden city etc. if you are going to olympics this is a great choice as right on the ring road. if the price is right well worth considering"
48,42,"Oct 27 2006	Great Staff Good Food Wonderful Atmosphere	We stayed here in September 2006 with a tour group. The staff was excellent and worked very hard at trying to get everything right. The food was outstanding. Our group had two dinners there and the buffet breakfast - all very good. I learned the hotel was recently renovated, and it showed! It is not close to the center of the city, so may not be ideal location wise, but it was worth it!"
49,42,"Oct 18 2006 	Not Bad at all	I used the Hilton recently as the Shangri La, my usual Beijing hotel, was full.I'd stayed here before and was pleased to see that the hotel has undergone a significant renovation. The front desk staff were helpful and escorted me to my check in point on the Executive floor, where I was offered drinks while they processed the check in.My room facilities were first class and included a dedicated fax, printer, rotating flat screen TV and DVD player. There was also a TV on the bathroom wall.The bathroom was large and included a walk in shower.A small gripe: the renovations still seemed to be going on and the noise, especially in the lobby and bar, was intrusive.And why do Hilton insist on charging for internet access when their competitors offer it for free?"

1,49,"Nov 6 2009 	Beyond Expectations	Upon our arrival we were please to find that Holiday Inn had met our request for an early check in of 7am! The rooms were way beyond our expectations - after a long day of sightseeing we could look forward to returning to the comfort of our room. The free wi-fi in the rooms and the computer terminals provided at common areas were a real bonus. Receptionist were helpful. Only possible downside is the location - not walking distance to a subway. However it is very conveninent and relatively cheap to catch a bus or cab. For the price paid and the quality of the rooms and service provided, I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Beijing!"
2,49,"Oct 15 2009 	much nicer than expected	This was a lovely hotel. The rooms were large, comfortable, clean and well equipped. The bed was by far the most comfortable I experienced during our month in China. The hotel has great facilities that include computers with free internet access and a laundry room. Its a good 20 minute walk to the nearest metro but its not an unpleasant walk. There are a few restaurants and a big supermarket close by. My only criticism of this hotel is that the breakfast sometimes fell short of the other high standards. If you are an early bird then the food is hot and plentiful but for the last hour of service the staff have a tendancy to let the food go cold and stop replacing things."
3,49,Sep 26 2009 	Good hotel	I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only things that I did not like is if you went to breakfast around 7:30am instead of 6:30am it made it vary difficult to find a seat to eat and the food goes quick so you would have to wait till they bring out new trays of food. I also found that the hotel was pretty far from most places and I found it pretty difficult to get taxis some nights. The nearest subway station was about 25-30 minutes away.
4,49,"Aug 25 2009 	Great value for money helpful staff	Stayed 3 nights in August 2009 (bad month to visit Beijing, its too hot!!). The hotel is either new or has undergone extensive renovations recently, so the rooms are in a really good condition. The free WiFi is fast and easy - both, my laptop and my phone connected without a hitch. They also have free internet terminals (I think there are 8 of them) for guests to use.The breakfast spread is OK, though not great. The one big problem is a strange smell in the rooms - apparently they have some sort of sanitation issue. However, since we hardly spent time in the room, thats was bearable. Also, the hotel is far from the touristy bits of town (Forbidden City, the lake area etc.), but taxis in Beijing are cheap. However, as we found out, getting a cab suring rush hour can be quite an experience (we waited 45 minutes and walked a few miles before we got one willing to take us back to the hotel one evening).The best part about the hotel is the staff, especially Mike the Operations Manager - flexible and anticipating guest requests and fulfilling them quickly. Even housekeeping did quite a good job. There was another friendly woman at the front desk, but I forget her name.On the whole, really good value for money, considering it is an Express by Holiday Inn."
5,49,"Aug 24 2009	Great Value for money	I've checked into the Holiday Inn Express - Temple of Heaven after staying in the Westin Beijing, Financial Street for 2 nights - and i didn't feel like i've been banished to some dodgy hotel (that's a good sign). Don't expect a bellboy to bring your luggage - do it yourself. That's why the hotel is able to give u the damn fantastic rates for the room nights WITH breakfast included. the Great Room is the in-house restaurant. I'v ordered a Sweet &amp; Sour pork rice &amp; a Kungpow Chicken Rice @ RMB$38 each. Pricey by Chinese standards, but it's a quick fix and is tasty. Comes with fruits and a bowl of soup. Yummy. Breakfast is not too bad. (I am not a fussy person). THe locality is in a suburb area - so its relatively safe. I don't feel like i have to watch my back when i am walking back. Also, there are rows of small eateries about a 7mins walk if you want to try the local food, along the walk to the Temple of Heaven. I've tried this restaurant, &quot;Hangzhou Eatery&quot; (With a red signboard) and it's run by a couple from Zhejiang province. Their speciality is their dumpling (served till around 8pm) and buns (only in the morning). Do try it. It's really yummy - and i've tried Crystal Jade, Din Tai Feng's before, and not that i haven't had the best..so this is good &amp; cheap. All in all, the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven may be not that convenient or near a train station, but it's comfortable and it feels like going home.."
6,49,"Aug 19 2009 	budget hotel good value for money	It was a bit difficult to locate the hotel since some taxi drivers are unfamiliar with it. But make sure that you have the hotel write the address in Mandarin and mark the location in the map, this will be very helpful. Via taxi, it is 20 mins away from Wangfujang shopping street (because of the traffic) and 20-30 mins away from the Forbidden City. and 5-10 mins from the Temple of Heaven. The rooms are not that big but not cramped. It has all basic toiletries including slippers. No minibar/fridge though. The bed and pillows gave me a good night sleep. However, some construction seemed to be ongoing during the day so it would be a bit difficult to sleep in during the day. Staff are nice but there were only 2 people manning the reception desk, and no one to carry the bags. Breakfast was not so good but I guess this was expected for the price.Also, I was lucky enough to discover a local market nearby where you can buy fruits, vegetables at non-tourist prices (i.e. 1kg peaches for 1.5 yuan)."
7,49,"Aug 17 2009 	Great value pleasant stay am going again	My first tip is have the address written in Chinese and explain where it is located. It is new and most taxi drivers are not familiar with the location although it is near the Temple of Heaven.Breakfast is buffet and has a big variety. Go early if there are groups staying there. Can change money at the desk. Make sure money is in excellent shape or it will be refused.The room is comfortable and internet access is free. Computers are in a couple of areas but I always carry mine for convenience. Explore the neighborhood if you have time, There is a hutong nearby that we enjoyed visiting. You can walk to Hongqaio market and there is a new market next to it that is good to visit. Hongqaio is good for pearls and knockoffs. For pearls of good quality go to Josephine on 4th floor. I have dealt with her for 8 years and she is very honest. Feel safe to have her mail things. There is a noodle place across the street from Hongqaio and it is a lot of fun.People at Holiday Inn express are young but very capable and attend to whatever you need. I liked this place better than the 5 stars I have stayed in there. No refrigerator in the room which was not a big deal for us. Rooms are quite. I am staying there again leaving for China tomorrow."
8,49,"Aug 17 2009 	Good Value	We stayed in this hotel from 7 August for about 7 nights. The room was clean and modern. It is really value for money. We booked the room at about RMB200++ per night inclusive of 2 breakfast when they were having the &quot;Asia On Sale&quot; Promotion. Although the hotel is a bit out of the city centre, however, the public transports are very conveniently access to most of the places and attractions. There is a bus stop near the hotel. You may take the bus no. 102 directly to the Zoo at RMB1.00 per trip. Besides that, you may also take bus no. 102 to the &quot;XuanWuMen&quot; station (subway line 2) which can bring you to most of the places that can access by the subway....If you are coming from the Beijing International Airport, you may take a shuttle bus from Airport terminal (which will cost you about RMB16 / pax) to Xidan and from there to take a taxi to the hotel will cost you about RMB20.If you are taking taxi all the time, please inform the driver that the hotel is in Nanwei Road in stead of the hotel name as most of the driver are not familiar with the hotel name. You may also tell them the name of the hotel but must inform them it is at Nanwei Road as the driver may bring you to the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven instead.Please do a lot of homework if you are intend to explore Beijing yourself by the cheapest way as the reception are not so helpful in giving direction and they will only ask you to take taxi. (Probably, they are not so familiar with the public transport system)Overall, it was a good experience."
9,49,Jul 22 2009 	Great location for local sights but problems with the room and service	Could have been a lot better really - the service was just average with difficulty understanding English. We took 2 rooms as they couldn't accomodate all 4 of us in one room and our room was a bit smelly - terrible view of a building site and lots of rubbish and then our air con broke down the last night (but while we were asleep) so we woke up all hot and bothered. Having said all that - the location is great - very close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl market (if you take a rickshaw back make sure the price is negotiated up front - we did this and they still wanted 40 euro!?? yeah right!) and if you walk the opposite direction there is a yoshinora and a large park.
10,49,"Jul 20 2009 	Good value. Located in good proximity to bus line bank nearby restaurants	Very reasonable pre-paid rate.Arrived late into PEK, took taxi to hotel for 130Y (got Yuan from exchange in airport). Taxi no problem - I had everything in Chinese characters and had a google map just in case -The driver used both. The hotel desk clerk spoke English and was very efficient with check-in. I told her friends were arriving by train at 6am and asked if their rooms could be available when they got in - they were able to check-in early with no issue and she grouped our rooms together on the same floor. I did note there were several tour buses at the hotel. European groups: French and Italian. A very nice group.Breakfast Buffet 630a-10a was PLENTIFUL: juices, coffee, cereals, fruit, congee, salad, noodles (lo mein), rice, vegetables, bread, eggs and meat. Very nice staff. There are neighborhood restaurants, convenience stores and street vendors very close (walk). Room: Clean / Simple, typical US Holiday Inn Express with a slightly smaller room/bath. Beds are a bit hard, but the pillows and linens were nice quality. Hairdryer a nice feature. There is no alarm clock, bring your own or ask for a wake-up call. Plenty of outlets (chinese). 42&quot; flat screen English and Chinese channels should you have the time to watch. Good water pressure. Windows open if desired. Climate control worked well.Wake-up Calls and Taxi: They record these requests manually in a notebook - but they executed each time - quite nice. Had a taxi to the airport back and the driver arrived 30min early - we were ready for him. When we left - the desk clerk didn't spoke very, very little English - which was okay as we needed nothing other than to say we are checking out - he happily said &quot;OK.&quot;Internet: Free Internet, 6 workstations I think and WIFI.Vending machine in lobby."
11,49,"Jul 18 2009 	no fridge	great hotel , free buffet for breakfast, limited items for the restaurant, good staff, free computer for tourist, cosy room with satellite tv and cheap for beijing. great value. my only complaint is no mini fridge, strange ...... how could any modern hotel not have a mini fridge , its very hot in july and if u want a cold drink u need to got to the lobby to get a drink from the soda machine. hard to imagine what they were thinking when the built the place. be sure to take a hotel business card with the address for cabs. there is a IGA store down the street with any type of drink or grocery u need. restaurants are everywhere within a block or 2. the value is very good with this hotel"
12,49,"Jul 15 2009 	Cant be better lol	That was my first time to live in the Holiday Inn Express Hotel. The room i was living in was clean and luxurious. I could also smell the natural scent from the lobby. The service was helpfull, so I really enjoyed the trip in Beijing. Everything was awesome, the people, the service, the environment and the food. I will go there again next time I visit Beijing."
13,49,"Jul 2 2009 	Good Value	We booked the hotel directly at the Holiday Inn website. While the location wasnt the best, we still booked this hotel because of the buy 2 get 1 free promotion going on!Anyway, its only a short cab ride to Hepingmen or Qianmen subway stations, Tiananmen Square, etc. It's 700 meters from Temple of Heaven, we went there by cab as well. It's easy to hail a cab from the hotel and they are not expensive. The room was well appointed with a queen size bed and a sofa. Breakfast was free and adequate. There are 5 computers free for use at the 2nd floor by the breakfast area.We consider the hotel a good value for the price, even without the promotion."
14,49,Jun 21 2009 	Good hotel a good 25min drive away from shopping	We stayed two very comfortable nights at this hotel on the south side of Beijing. Hotel was really nice and clean and reception staff was very helpful when checking in and when we needed a taxi.We had a room next to the elevators so we did hear sounds at night after closing the tv which was not so nice but not a bog problem.The biggest problem I had was the breakfast --&gt; it was horrible to us being scandinavian and used to smorgasbord style breakfast !Taxi from the hotel to the Silk Market was very cheap; only 25 yuan ! Free internet was a superb surprise !
15,49,"May 29 2009 	Good deal but average hotel	Beijing has such a wide selection of hotels, it's hard to decide where to stay. This hotel offers 1 of the best deals as it's a HolidayInn Express, with free internet &amp; B'fast. Room is great but the reception staff is not efficient nor helpful. When I arrive, the girl standing at the reception didn't know how to check in for us! 5 mins later, another staff came by to help us out. This hotel is not near to any subway station but one can take a cab to WangFujing or the main train station for 20rmb. Temple of Heaven, TianQiao Acrobatics theatre and TianQian cultural theatre (where one can catch international troupes performing SwanLake, dances) are within walking distance. HongQiao Pearl market &amp; the famous RoastDuck Restaurant QuanJuDe Main branch are within 10 min cab ride. For the price, it's a great deal for groups who have their own transport to ferry them everywhere. For individuals, be prepared to pay for cab rides to get around.Alternative for individuals, consider Novotel XinQiao, slightly more expensive but no free b'fast. However the subway station is just right there with lots of other shops n' restaurants nearby."
16,49,"May 19 2009 	Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven was a good value and a good find.	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven and it was a newly constructed wester style hotel. It was very clean, had high speed internet at no extra charge, a walk in glass shower, and they provided us with a free hot western style breakfast every morning, also had chinese style food. The staff was very helpful and professional and the hotel had a room dedicated as a laundry facility with washers and driers, iron and ironing board, and washroom and a big screen tv. The dailey rates were also very reasonable. We liked the hotel very much and give it a very high recommendation."
17,49,"May 14 2009 	Wouls stay here again	My family, wife and 9. y.o. son, stayed here for a week, we'd stay again if we return to Beijing. The rooms were clean &amp; modern, only complaint was with the shower nozzle spraying water everywhere, no big deal. Staff was wonderful, free breakfast buffett was very good, get there either early or late to get a table, the room fills up with guests going on bus tours. Free internet on 7 different hotel computers. This is a quiet residential area, good for sleeping, taxis are easy to hail and only cost about $2US to go downtown to the Forbidden City, etc. Take a card or map from the hotel with Chinese characters for the name of the hotel to show taxi drivers for for your return trip, they don't speak English. Before you get in the taxi to go back, make sure they nod to show you they know where the hotel is, about 50% didn't. In fact, show them the Chinese characters for wherever you want to go.For a great cheap massage, cheaper even than downtown, exit the hotel, make a left and go the end of the street, 1 block. Turn right, go about 100 meters, there is a hair salon on the left. After walking around wonderful sites, parks and hutongs all day, a 1 hour foot massage for $7US is incredible!"
18,49,"May 7 2009 	Clean New Rooms but so-so service	Stayed 3 nights. Surprised to see new/ modern/ clean rooms. Staff were not friendly except for one receptionist. Since this is Holiday Inn Express, we got free breakfast and free internet! Good value for money. Breakfast selection is good, except that the menu doesn't change much every day. You get the same food everyday except for one or two. Location is a bit far from downtown but taxis help make up for it. Place is exceptionally quiet which is a big plus! Walking to the hotel from Temple of Heaven takes about 10 minutes."
19,49,"Apr 23 2009 	Long way from the sights	Adequate hotel but be prepared to walk long distances or use taxis to get anywhere, no subway stations close by but a nice quiet residential street. Reception staff were poor. Rooms were good size and breakfast was very good with a mixture of chinese and western options, so good value altogether."
20,49,"Apr 18 2009 	clean comfortable reliable - a pleasant surprise	we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, Temple of Heaven for 3 nights whilst visiting Beijing. Located in a quiet residential area, taxis were easy to get and Central Beijing was at most 20 minutes away (depending on traffic). The rooms were comfortable, clean, recently refurbished. Reception staff were generally helpful. Breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. I would definitely recommend this hotel - very good value for money."
21,49,"Apr 14 2009 	Not fancy but great value for the money	We found the service and staff at this hotel to be very good. The hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very clean and modern. High speed internet and a buffet breakfast were included in the price of the room. The breakfast buffet was good,though not a large selection of food. Laundry facilities are also available at the hotel and were very clean and reasonably priced. Although a little tucked away, the hotel is a cheap cab ride to just about anywhere you'd like to go."
22,49,"Mar 22 2009 	Pleasant 	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on Nanwei Road &amp; was pleasantly surprised. The staff here were so friendly &amp; very helpful. Despite the hotel being a little out of the way &amp; I'm use to walking lots in every city I visit, Beijing without a doubt is massive so take a taxi to most places or to the nearest metro. Both are cheap....The hotel is very competitively priced &amp; is a nice walk to the temple of heaven. It's only 35 minutes walk to Tiananmen Square. Rooms were clean, modern etc.....I can only see this hotel getting better &amp; better...I hope to return."
23,49,"Mar 18 2009 	Good value for money	This hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and very helpful. The menu selections were limited but there were local restaurants close by. The rooms were very clean and the facilities were adequate if you are like us who don't need a fancy hotel since we are out all day anyway."
24,49,"Feb 16 2009 	Great hotel	Before we left for China, I did a lot of research on hotels and attractions. The hotel choices in Beijing is staggering--so many choices! Many hotels seemed to have issues with cleanliness so when I finally made reservations, I decided to go with brand names I was familiar with and the choice for Beijing was this hotel.The hotel staff was very helpful. We arrived early in the morning after taking an overnight train from Xi'an. Our rooms (2) were both ready. We were scheduled to go to the Great Wall early the next morning and before we even checked in, we had arranged for breakfast and a bag lunch for the next day--and the wireless was working on my mobile device as well. We were also invited to get breakfast for that day. When we returned later that day, our train tickets for the next part of our journey were delivered during the day and were waiting for us at the desk.The rooms were both better than expected--very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was great. We had been in Tibet for two weeks and had very poor experiences in one hotel in particular so this was very welcome. The location was fine. It is a fair distance from the subway station but with the location near the Temple of Heaven, it was easy to give directions to the taxi drivers to find the hotel (our son speaks enough Mandarin to get by), and there were plenty of taxis in the area. The breakfast was very good with a mix of western and local choices. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here very much."
25,49,"Oct 6 2008 	New Clean Convenient	The holiday inn express is everything it promises. A new hotel, clean rooms, clean sheets, no nonsense service, dependable buffet breakfast ... you get what you pay for - a good choice if you want to avoid more expensive places in BJ.Its location however, is not very convenient if you plan on using public transport. The nearest subway needs a taxi (probably 15-20mins walk)."
26,49,"Sep 18 2008	At the right price a good value choice	I also stayed at this property during the Olympics (it was also a good deal using Priorityclub points).The previous review is very accurate. But my perspective is slightly different. I'm giving it 4 stars based on VALUE. Assuming you can get a room here for about US$60, it's a good comparative choice. The hotel has what you NEED. About 7 free internet terminals (another luxury hotel in Beijing charged me a quarter a minute!), an excellent free breakfast with many Western options, and a self-serve laundry room (very rare in China, and very convenient). The rooms are modern and nice (although my bathroom had that occasional mild sewer smell). The map location shown on the Holiday Inn website is wrong (or at least was wrong last month). The hotel is about 5 blocks west of the west entrance to the Temple of Heaven. Not much of great interest to tourists in the immediate neighborhood (other than the Temple of Heaven). No easy subway access, but the location in convenient by taxi to the city center, and taxis are very cheap. If you don't mind relying on taxis, you will find the location to be pretty good."
27,49,"Sep 7 2008 	Affordable option during the Olympics	At a rate of 939 CNY per night, this was one of the only moderately priced hotels available during the Olympics. The daily breakfast buffet increased the value of the rate. The buffet featured Western dishes (bacon, scrambled eggs and sausage) as well as a few Chinese options (fried rice and bok choy). The hotel also serves lunch and dinner, but has a very limited menu of a few Chinese entrees. The hotel opened just a few days before we arrived, so the staff was still getting the hang of some things. However every request was handled with a smile and earnest effort. The front desk staff was able to give us information on arranging a tour to the Great Wall. The rooms were comfortable with a modern decor. My room got a thorough cleaning daily, but as I was out all day most days I don't know how long it took for housekeeping to come around.One of my travel companions had plumbing problems with his room, but was moved to a room that didn't have any issues. The whole neighborhood seems to having sewage issues, as a horrible odor sometimes came out of the gutters and pipes. The neighborhood seems to be going through some gentrificaiton. While we were there an IGA supermarket opened down the street and a coffee shop was on the opposite corner from the hotel. The neighborhood felt safe but was a little blighted with a vacant lot across from the hotel.The hotel is walking distance to the Temple of Heaven, but not centrally located to many other tourist attractions. Despite claims of being close to the subway, it's about a 30 minute walk to the Hepingmen station. However, it's a very short cab ride to the Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Shopping area. We relied on cabs for the majority of our transportation. The hotel staff helped us immensely by writing our destinations in Chinese to give to the taxi drivers. (We also had to be sure to have the hotel address in Chinese for our return ride. Since it was a new hotel, no one was familiar with it). The Hongqiao Pearl Market is on the east side of the Temple of Heaven, which was about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. The Yuan Long Silk Store is also close to the market. A branch of the popular restaurant for Peking roast duck called Quanjude is next to Hepingmen station. A McDonald's is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel on the way to the subway. There aren't a lot of other options around for Western meals. All and all it was an adequate stay for budget travel. Good for bargain hunters, but not very convenient for tourists. Pros: price, free broadband internet, friendly staff, complimentary bottled water, lcd tvCons: location, thin walls, shower w/o tub, no irons or alarm clocks in rooms, plumbing odor"

1,52,"Aug 5 2009 	Ok for a couple of nights	We were booked into this hotel by a tour guide with a link that showed it a 5 start hotel. Had we not expected a 5 start hotel we probably would have thought higher of this hotel. By American standards it is probably a 2-3 start hotel.We are well traveled Americans in Beijing for sight seeing and traveling with two tenage boys.1. The beds were hard but that was to be expected for Asia. We asked if they had a soft topper for the beds (some hotels have them for Western guests) but they did not.2. The bathroom was fine but the showers were stained from use.3. The towels were terrible...very soft but not cotton, you could not dry yourself! I ended up using the pillowcases!4.They had a flat screen TV but only one channel that was English speaking and it seemed to repeat itself a lot.5. Breakfast was good...lots of variety. You could get toast and butter!!6. They had free wi-fi in the lobby and they also had a computer you could use. Only problem was that it was in Chinese so you had to remember which buttons were yes and no.7. Not many Westerners there.8. Walls were thin...hear what our neighbors were doing.9. We could not comment on the location as we had our tour guide pick us up and drop us off in the morning and night.I know this all sounds negative but I like to know what I am getting myself into. If I went back to Beijing I would not stay at this hotel. I would look for a hotel that catered more to Westerners. We travel all over world and have been to China several times and from our own experience we like to come home to a comfortable hotel where you can relax. This was a hotel where you came back to sleep and shower (and drip dry)."
2,52,"Jun 28 2009 	Good BUT BEWARE	This is a nice faciility, the rooms were clean and modern, that's about all it has going for it. The staff spoke limited English. The entire 3rd floor where the small gym is has the lights turned off when the gym is closed, as I found out when I couldn't sleep at 4AM. The breakfast is included but has the same food choices every day, I got tired of it after the 2nd day.BIG WARNING!!! They tried to get some more money out of me when I was checking out, said I broke a floor lamp. We went back into the room with the manager and the scummy looking bell hop said that the lamp shade was hanging off about to fall. I told them no way and stormed out of there. I'll see if this shows up on my VISA. They also tried to get some extra money from my tour guide saying he broke a wooden hanger.Oh, the hotel is also located a the end of a street where there is major building construction occuring, even into the night and early morning hours. Nothing like trying to sleep when there is a lot of machery buzzing around outside."
1,56,Aug 16 2009 	too much little aggravations for business traveler.	I booked a single room (1 night) with this hotel for reason of our company rate just the same as usual Renaissance and Raddisson.On top the negotiated rate was including free airport transfer to the hotel. So thought let's try. Well... on my way from Europe to Beijing (in Helsinki) I phoned the hotel for information how to get the Free airport transfer. Then the assistant manager (Kelvin) say's to me the rate (which was already confirmed

10,56,Oct 26 2006 	When in Beijing	Stayed here for 6 nights - very attentive service - rooms excellent - beds turned down at night - large spaces - 8 restaurants offering a variety of dining but you must try the revolving restaurant on the 29th Floor - be weary though the staff will greet you but do not expect them to understand much English

1,57,"Nov 26 2009 	Best place for travelers	Hotel was very nice, the room was wonderful and really fit the price. We got 9 nights in the hotel and we were very please and happy . we got a lot of fun and enjoyed our trip. We got really nice services with the staffs. And very honest.Thank for the hotels service . you are great you did very good job."
2,57,"Nov 21 2009	Good 3 star with WONDERFUL staff	Beautiful lobby, best staff - very helpful and competent. They were always willing to go the extra mile for our demanding group. Great suggestions for things to do especially since we had several free days. Excellent location near the best fake goods shopping at the Silk St. Market. HAGGLE LIKE HECK there and be prepared to get a headache very quickly. Also, loved having the great hot pot restaurant around the corner (don't eat at McDonald's - this was the ONLY place in China who's food made someone in our group ill). Hotel had great breakfasts, especially the custom soup bar and dim sum. Did enjoy the thai chi entertainment. Of the three hotels we stayed at, this had the best location and food but was definitely not a 5 star in terms of room. Room was somewhat conventional and small. But the maid was very diligent and conscientious about keeping room spotless and well stocked. The pool, fitness center while very nice, took forever to get to. Bathroom amenties were the worst, poor quality shampoo etc. Glad I'd bought my own. Overall would say to stay but don't have high expectations of the room itself."
3,57,Oct 16 2009 	Nice hotel.	Nice hotel. The position was excellent and the staff was very helpful. Would stay again.
4,57,"Jun 21 2009 	Good hotel - worth a stay!	I stayed one night at the New Otani in September 2004. This Japanese style hotel was recommended to me by a friend from Beijing, so I had high hopes. I wasn't dissapointed. Good rooms. Good location (good Peking duck restaurant nearby). Nice swimming pool and Japanese bath facilities. Nice breakfast with plenty of choice. Would probably return, as there's so many hotels in Beijing to choose from - at least I know that one was good."
5,57,"Aug 8 2008	Central Location Comfortable Hotel	As part of a tour group package, we stayed 4 nights at the New Otani Chang Fu Gong Hotel in Beijing. The hotel is centrally located on Chang An Avenue, the major east-west artery that runs past Tien An Men and the Forbidden City. It is a good choice if you cannot afford to stay at the luxury hotels near Wangfujing Avenue. The public areas are top notch and very well maintained. There is a casual buffet restaurant and a pricier Japanese restaurant onsite. The rooms can comfortably sleep 2 (but probably not more) and the furniture and condition of the room was fine. The beds were quite firm and comfortable and the duvets made for a good night's sleep. Our view was over the busy Chang An Avenue. One of the best features of the hotel package we received was the daily complimentary breakfast buffet that included both Asian and Western breakfast items. There was a huge selection. The hotel complex contains a health club that includes a huge squash court, indoor swimming pool and fitness aerobic room. The spas included separate mens and womens soaking tubs and saunas. The Line 1 and Line 2 subway station Jianguo Men is an easy few minutes walk from the hotel. It requires walking on the pedestrian underpass access of a very busy intersection, but not much of a problem as long as you cross with the locals. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the touristy Silk Market and Friendship Store, as well as a Sizzler, TGIF, 7-11 and Haagen Daas when eating chinese food everyday becomes burdensome. Overall the central location was a hit with us and I would consider returning."
6,57,"Mar 6 2008 	Very Nice Hotel	The New Otani is a great hotel. It was very lovely and did live up to boasts on the various websites. It is a very modern hotel with very Euro/Modern furniture. The hotel room was roomy, very clean, the staff in the restaurant, business center, front desk and all throughout the hotel were very helpful. You can tell that the Chinese in this hotel have studied hospitality and demand that all of it's employees practice it. It was a in a great location in central Beijing, near restaurants and shopping. The ammenities that you would expect to find in a 5* hotel are all there, including sattelite TV, internet access, etc. There were a total of 6 of us who stayed in 3 rooms and we all were quite satisfied with the hotel."
7,57,"Nov 2 2007 	classy hotel	Luxury hotel with elegant, clean and well-equipped rooms. Unforgettable tasty and wide-ranging breakfast and dinner, served in a elegant restaurant overlooking a peaceful inner japanese garden. Further thematic restaurants (i.e. japanese) on the first floor. Swimming pool, indoor tennis/basket/volleyall courts and luxury day-spa with beauty salon inside the hotel. We totally loved our stay here!!!! The unique imperfection regards the restaurant waiters, absolutely not appropriate to the standard of the hotel."
8,57,"Jun 8 2007	Great location	Stayed at the New Otani Beijing for three nights. Best of all about this property is the location. Great indoor pool and fitness room. Had the best Peking duck dinner next door at a restaurant called Duck King. Also next to the hotel, right next to McDonalds is great massage place that was very classy, clean, with great service. We like the massage place so much that we visited for two consecutive nights. The downside about this hotel is the worned out carpet and the bathtub/shower in the rooms we stayed in. Otherwise the hotel is reasonable and the breakfast is adequate."
9,57,"Apr 12 2007 	We would stay at the Otani again	My family stayed at the New Otani in late March while we were in Beijing as part of a three-city China vacation. The Otani was our favorite hotel during the trip. The lobby was spacious and the staff were eager to help you with bags, questions, etc. The rooms were fine, but ours was a smoking room which we did not like. We called the lobby and they sent someone up promptly with some air freshener spray. Breakfast was good as well. The dining room was big so you didn't feel crowded with other guests. And the wait staff were quick with more coffee and to take your dish when you were done. The only bad thing was that the hotel was located on a busy road so you couldn't really cross the street unless you went to the overpass. We sort of felt like we were away from the city center a bit. We would stay there again though the next time we're in Beijing."
10,57,"Mar 3 2007 	Great Value for Money	Stayed here on business for 1 week at the end of January. Found the check in and lobby to be quite pleasant. The lounge is a bit small but Beijing has so much to offer theres not much point staying in. Room size was very good and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was spotless. Hotel staff very friendly and generally efficient. I found the western breakfast to be a bit average but the asian breakfast looked good however theres only so much Chinese food the body can take.The best thing about the hotel is the location, just 2 minutes by taxi to the silk market (where you can buy the best fake goods), Anything you can think of, just ask and they will have it. Remember to pay only about 20 percent of the asking price at most. Tianeman square/forbidden city is 15 minutes by taxi Which should only cost the equivalent of 2 US Dollars.Hotel rate very reasonable and overall I found the hotel to be excellent value for money."
11,57,"Jan 26 2007	Nice	Very nice lobby, decent size rooms and beds, helpful employees. A nice perk is the tap water is drinkable and the location is central. Close walk to malls and restaurants.Also, the complimentary breakfast was exceptional.Stayed here two nights and would definitely stay here again."
12,57,"Dec 31 2006 	Safe Choice	Convenient location for both business and tourist. All the cab drivers know where it is. Hotel food is adequate or above average with the Japanese being the better choice. Since it is a hotel under Japanese management, showers and bathroom facilities can be on the short side and not designed for westerners. No joke! :) I did find it kind of odd since two of my business colleagues started to joke about it. Room is of decent size and clean enough. It needs a little updating. The lobby bar is of decent size and is a good place to unwind after a day of sightseeing/meetings."
13,57,"Nov 2 2006	Lovely thought not quite a Westerner's dream	This was my second stay in thishotel while on a tour of China.The facility is really lovely and the rooms are quite nice. As with many hotels in China, the level of English fluency is fairly thin: fine when they are first talking to you (as at chekc-in) and can speak in the standard phrases, but lost once you start asking questions. Your best bet is to keep your eyes and ears open for the ONE really good English speaker on duty at the moment -- and there usually is ONE -- and try to get him or her to handle your request.This chain is Japanese-owned, and that is apparent to a Western sensibility in small ways. You may find that a plus or a minus.The breakfast buffet is quite good. The business center staff was very helpful and competent. Porters and door attendants polite and attentive.The staff was very helpful when I wanted to buy a bottle of wine as a gift for someone in my group: they let me purchase it from the Western restaurant in the hotel, even though it was not yet opened for the day.I'm not that crazy about the location, as i like to walk around the neighborhood a bit when I'm in a city, and it doesn't feel that central. On two sides, it is hemmed in by huge elevated highways, so your walking choices are limited. though our guide claimed there was no such central area that was more commercial for walking.Overall, I was pleased with my stay there."
14,57,"Mar 10 2006	New Otani was a great Beijing stay	We stayed here as part of a tour group. It was the 1st city on our 2 week China trip. It's mostly a Japanese business hotel and a few tourists. The breakfast buffet was very good and they had live cooking stations as well. Lots of choices.The rooms were very clean and nice sized and quiet. The staf was very friendly, though they speak more Japanese than English. It's centrally located and about a 20 min walk to Tianimen Square. I would highly recommend staying here."
15,57,Apr 29 2005	Great Location	Stayed in New Otani in April 2005. Great location. Hotel room was decent size. Part of a tour package. Room was very clean and quiet. Buffet breakfast was part of package. Breakfast was fine. Staff spoke decent English. One block away from a shopping center and the Beijing Frendship store. 10 minutes away from the Forbidden City. Expedia lists it as 2 star its closer to a 4 star. Tour stated it was 5 star. Nothing really special to make it stand out except for location.
16,57,"Nov 8 2004	Quality Stay	We stayed here last year and had a very comfortable stay. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable. However, the rooms are nothing fancy and are in need of updating. The breakfasts were very good and more than ample. There is a choice of two buffets, Western and Eastern. The service and staff were great and attentive and spoke English to a small extent. We will be staying here again Spring, 2005"

1,63,"Nov 17 2009	Very good location	This hotel has a great history and wonderful location. You can easily walk to the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Square. The staff was very helpful,"
2,63,"Nov 6 2009 	Excellent location good hotel	The Jade Garden's location couldn't be better for sightseeing in central Beijing and you can easily walk to Tianenmen Square, the Forbidden City and some of the main shopping districts. We had been staying at a much larger five star hotel for work prior to moving to the Jade Garden and we definitely preferred the smaller hotel's location and more personalised service. The staff were friendly and helpful, although I would recommend trying to book a room rate that includes breakfast. Ours didn't include breakfast and we were constantly harassed during brekkie to ensure that we paid, which was rather annoying first thing in the morning! The rooms themselves were great and I could not fault them for the very good rate that we were paying. The rooms were clean and bright, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were modern and clean. The air conditioning in Beijing hotels doesn't ever seem to get cool though, but that was feature at the other bigger hotels too. My friend ended up getting upgraded to a superior room which was really large and very well appointed, so that is definitely worth a few extra pounds. The hotel also has a very interesting history as a guesthouse during the Long March and later became a headquarters for some Communist leaders. I think it was completely redone for the Beijing Olympics and they have certainly done a good job with the revamp. The most annoying thing that happened during our stay was that we were curfewed inside the hotel during rehersals for China's National Day and 60th anniversary of the PRC. We had to stay inside the hotel for over 24 hours, which we would have preferred not to have had to do, but that was a government order rather than anything to do with the property! Besides that, we got to do all the sightseeing that we wanted and the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us out to the Great Wall too.Colleagues of mine are visiting Beijing next April and I have already recommended that they spend a few nights at the Jade Garden and I hope that they enjoy their time there as much as we did!"
3,63,Oct 9 2009 	Nestled near the Gardens	The service was impeccable and the room was a very good value. The location was excellent because having been in Beijing several times before we had not had the opportunity to explore this particular area. We appreciated the service. I needed to reconfirm some flights and one of the front desk personnel was kind enough to perform that service.
4,63,"Sep 4 2009 	Best Hotel I've had in China	I would just say that I loved this hotel. Staff were extremely helpful, and nice. The room was far better than I expected, with the large flat screen TV, and internet access. Nice big bed also, with a decent mattress. Freebie gifts like bottles of water were also welcome. I also loved how they came to clean the rooms at 3pm rather than early when I'm trying to sleep off a hangover. Bit difficult to find by taxi, since the maps I printed online were for a different place close-by. Also the pictures of the outside, don't reflect the true front of the hotel. The big sign at the top has also disappeared. But its very close to everything, and once you get one of their hotel cards showing the directions in chinese, then you'll have no problems. Ask for their tourist maps with chinese/english, since it was an excellent help to me."
5,63,"Jul 18 2009 	Nice hotel good location	We stayed at Jade Garden based on a recommendation from our friend who used to live and work in Beijing. We stayed in Beijing for 5 nights and wanted a hotel with a good location. Jade Garden fulfilled that. The hotel is nearby to the Forbidden City, Tienanmen Sq. Wangfujing shopping strip and night market. Restaurants also very close in walking distance.The room was clean and well presented. Flat screen television with 2 English stations, CNN and a movie channel. The bathroom was clean and had all amenities.The staff were friendly and accommodating. Umbrellas were supplied without a necessary deposit. They even delivered a fruit tray on the first night!All in all, a good stay and recommended."
6,63,"Jul 12 2009 	Perfect Location	This hotel is in a great location - Beijing is so vast that you could end up spending all your time on the subway or in traffic in a taxi. So to be in a hotel that is within walking distance of the Forbidden City, Tian anmen Square, Wangfui Night Market, Bei Hai park etc was just great. We had executive room which was adequate and certainly value for money. We only ate breakfast in the hotel since there were so many great restuarants close by but that was good. Would definately return."
7,63,May 22 2009 	Great location for Forbidden City area!	Was in Beijing for a few days with friends. This hotel was within walking distance to the forbidden city and close to nightlife areas. The only negatiive was the restaurant. There is much better food up the street at the outdoor market! But a real find for easy access to Beijing.
8,63,"May 12 2009 	Double check your snack bars 	My husband and I stayed in Jade Garden Hotel for a week. It started with disappointed double bed room. The room was okay size but there are &quot;no drawers&quot; for us to put our clothes. 6 Day stayed in Jade Garden Hotel, we had to leave our clothes in our luggage. The closet was extremely small. Very stupid design for customers hanging their clothes. Maximum clothes we can hang in there...4 clothes!! Bathroom was okay but water drained so slowly from bathtub. We mentioned to front desk but not sure if they really &quot;fixed' or not. It feels like a cheap hotel bathroom. Free Internet Access : Gosh...most of times were very slow. Sometimes when we woke up in the middle of night to use PC, internet was much faster. Well, those were minor things we were not happy with. The most disappointed part was &quot;one coke&quot; was missing from our room's refrigerator. We found out on last day before we completed check out process. I told them... &quot; tell me who come to our room to drink our coke from our refrigerator&quot;. It's ridiculous !! We went to different countries and stayed in different hotel. Some expensive and some cheap hotels and never had any issues with someone drank our drink from our room. Of course, they wanted to cover Hotel reputation. They changed tone by saying...we probably forgot to fill in new one when previous guests checked out. Then, they returned my CNY 200 deposits back to us. Come on, I double checked everything at first night when we checked in. Now, at least one thing I should thank for is they have safety box inside of closets and we also bring a lock to lock our luggage. For a security of personal stuff, bring a lock to lock your luggage. Never said never!!"
9,63,"Feb 20 2009	Excellent location clean comfortable with good service	This Hotel has an excellent location, walking distance form the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, night food market and good shopping locations. In addition it is clean, comfortable and well managed. Furthermore it is a historic building that was completely renovated to a high standard less than 10 years ago. Its prices are competitive if not cheap and you definitely get what you pay for. It is less than 10 minutes walk from the excellent subway system and there are plenty of good restaurants to be found nearby. Staff are friendly and helpful highly recommended."
10,63,"Oct 18 2007 	Nice Little Hotel with a Difference (from the hotel chains).	I stayed in a standard room on level 4 @ the hotel for three nights recently as a single guest. The room was average in size but was very clean and tidy. It offered all the normal comfort and supplies you would fine in any international hotel chains. What sets it apart from the hotel chain properties is the service. Service was there before I could finish requesting it! Well, just about. The location is excellent. The price is very competitive. I must add that I am a Chinese speaking guest and I can not comment on the staff members' English proficiency. They were always ready to help neverhteless."
11,63,"Jul 5 2007 	Good choice in central Beijing	The Cui Ming Zhuang is a pretty good choice for hotels in Beijing. As other reviewers have said, it is in a convenient location, and the rooms are pretty nice and very clean. The staff is efficient and polite, and my requests for towels and room amenities met with rapid, polite response. My room was rather strange, in that the window overlooked the dining room, and did not give on the outside, so there was no way to get fresh air; however, the air in the summer in Beijing is not particularly fresh, anyway, so I did not perceive this as a problem.Hotels in China seem to have their air conditioning programmed so that the cooling (but not the fan) turns off sometime in the night, no matter where you have the thermostat set., Cui Ming Zhuang was no exception -- we would come back in the afternoon to a very chilly 20 deg (68 deg F) room, not change the thermostat, and by morning it would be a somewhat stuffy 25 deg (77 deg F)."
12,63,"May 21 2007 	Decent Hotel	We stayed at this hotel on two separate occassions during a three week trip to China. For location, you cannot do better. You can actually see one of the gates (not an entrance though) to the Forbidden City from the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Tiannamen and Beihai Park are 10-15 minutes walks. One block away in the opposite direction contains great shopping and some Western restaurant options. The rooms were clean and in very good condition. HINT: ask for a room on the second floor or higher. The room on the first floor was noticeably smaller than the room on the third floor during our second stay. The first floor bathroom was also smaller and apparently traditional for Chinese guests, with no tub, a hand held shower head and a wooden grate over a drain. The third floor bathroom contained a traditional bathroom. One drawback was the limited English skills of the staff, although they were very earnest and tried very hard to provide assistance. The best English speakers were the overall hotel manager and oddly, the dayshift bellhop. Our expectations were also tempered by the understanding that we were traveling in China and English speakers are a luxury. A second drawback was the A/C units in both rooms. Neither made the rooms very cool. Both thermostats were set at the lowest setting of 15 Degrees Celsius, although the room temperature never approached this level. Also, the cleaning staff would always readjust the thermostat to 25 degrees while we were out during the day. The breakfast buffet at 68 yuan (about $9) was very decent. Except for the AC issues, overall a very good hotel."
13,63,"May 14 2007 	very good hotel at a very good price	I just returned from Beijing and stayed for a week at the Cui Ming Zhuang. Be aware that the hotel is also known as the Jade Garden Hotel. Thats what the sign in front of the hotel says.The location is excellent... 2 blocks from Wangfujing Street, 2 blocks from the Forbidden City.The hotel was very good. It was remodeled last year so everything is new and clean. The breakfast buffet has western and chinese food for 68 yuan per person. You can get a cheaper breakfast at a cafe about a block away if you are going towards the Forbidden City... I think its called Gate Cafe or Egate Cafe.The only downside to our stay was the limited English of the staff. The man at the travel counter and in the gift store spoke no English at all. Regardless, they try to be helpful and have a good attitude.They have standard rooms and suites. We reserved our room through [--] for 490 Yuan a night for a standard room."

1,64,Nov 4 2009 	love this hotel	I've stayed at this hotel twice and I loved it each time. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet has so much variety and the chinese restaurant was great! Its very close to the silk alley market which was nice so we didnt have to get a cab. The gardens outside were great with real ducks! I would stay at this hotel again and again!
2,64,"Oct 11 2009 	Nicely situated hotel	The hotel is clean and well appointed. Bedrooms are fairly basic and a bit tired in need of some decoration. Check in staff were quite rude and not very helpfull. The lack of English can make communicating very difficult. The hotel has a lot of trainee staff who we found were excellent. They made the effort to use what little English they had to converse with us. Something that the other hotel staff did not even attempt. The opera is an absolute must, an excellent evening entertainment. The restaraunts in the hotel were average with the best being the Apollo but be prepared to be served lukewarm meals. The location of the hotel is quite good for those who like to do a lot of walking to take in sights. Nearest metro station a good 20 min walk but access to all major attractions could be got to from here."
3,64,"Oct 5 2009	Strictly average	Our tour stayed at this hotel, it was billed at 4 star, but this is not an international 4 star rating. The rooms were clean but in need of some refurbishment, especially the hall carpets were very dirty in places. Ask for a non-smoking room if this is important to you - they probably won't guarantee it though! We had rooms that had definately been smoked in and even a room that is smoke free will open onto a corridor which at times can be hazy with smoke - it seems guests go out in the corridor to smoke. Beds were comfortable but pillows hard and weighed a ton - never come across anything like it, you can get a soft pillow if you ask enough times. There was a water dispenser in the room, both hot and cold, which was very useful till on the second day when plugged into the socket (too noisy to leave on all night) it blew up and shorted out all the lights. A replacement was brought quite swiftly but it then proceeded to leak all over the floor. The air conditioning was turned off mid stay as they decided it wasn't necessary any more. Day temperatures were mid 20s and we disagreed. One member of the party managed to get a fan delivered to the room after it was found the windows had been screwed shut and could not be opened. The breakfast is quite good - nasty 'juice' but lots of bacon, eggs etc. plus local food if you like. We did not try the restaurants. The Business Centre is quite expensive for internet connection and when they decide it is time to close they just switch your connection off without warning! They were most accommodating in organising us a packed breakfast one morning when we had a 4am start - it took the chef, banqueting manager and another manager to organise it but they did a great job of a bacon sandwiches! There is a convenient supermarket across the road for soft drinks etc and the hotel's location is quite near both the famous Qianmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant in one direction and Tianmen Square in another - both about 10 minutes by taxi. Whilst English was spoken in the hotel most of the staff wore &quot;Trainee&quot; badges and they definately needed some training on customer service."
4,64,"Sep 7 2009 	Great Value for Money	At just $50 per night including breakfast, you really can't go wrong. Hotel is nicely decorated but not over the top, rooms and corridors are spotlessly clean, buffet breakfast is pretty standard fare but there is a decent choice between Western and Chinese food. Location is excellent with just a short cab ride to Tianmen square, Temple of Heaven and for those interested in shopping, the Pearl Market. There is also Beijing opera in the hotel if you like that sort of thing.Internet connection is quite expensive, but other than that I would have no hesitation in staying here again."
5,64,"Jul 24 2009	Very nice hotel pricey internet	Room spacious, nicely appointed, big soft towels, hard pillows, elegant lobby, Beijing Opera theme, with operas performed nightly (dinner/theater) in hotel theater.Bountiful breakfast served buffet style in Western restaurant and in Chinese/Western restaurant.Charge for internet is 50 Yuan (7 dollars?) for 24 hours (from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.)"
6,64,"May 2 2009 	Nice hotel	Nice hotel, but poor Chinese restaurant and expensive European restaurant. Location is good but you are still depending on taxi to get home. About 30 min walk to Tiananmen Square or temple of heaven park (incl. pearl market) Business center is expensive, 5 RMB to print one page. Internet in your room is 50 RMB each day (from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.) Reception is helpful, specially the assistant manager."
7,64,"Mar 2 2009 	kanon	The hotel has a theatre inside, (but you have to pay). It has at least 4 different restautrants . Very nice rooms, friendly staff. Fresh, clean."
8,64,"Nov 27 2008	lovely hotel	i stayed here twice on my holiday to china with just you holidays. it was a lovely hotel, nice and clean and the staff were welcoming. had a lovely large room on the 6th floor. the room i had on the 1st stay had 2 single beds and the 2nd time we stayed i had a very large kingsize bed, if not a superking!! the rooms were both clean and functional. the bathrooms were lovely and clean with a nice selection of toiletries.the buffet breakfast was adequate but could of been hotter, this was due to the fact that people werent shutting the covers on the pans when finished with them. the freshmade omlettes were to die for. the dinners we had in the hotel were ok.the bar on the 2nd floor was lovely and the staff friendly. they did a lovely margurita!! the theatre was lovely and the beijing opera was an enjoyable few hours. i would definately stay here again and reccommend it to anyone."
9,64,"Aug 17 2008	Boring - but functional and clean	Qianmen is a tourist hotel, several streets/blocks away from the shopping area and what I believe is the best city of Beijing. You need to take a taxi. However, there is some shops, a McDonalds and a supermarket close by. The hotel overall is very boring, lobby area is without charm and I was really missing a nice bar spot to relax and join a cocktail or two with friends. The bar is there, but it is not welcoming you. Room with good standard equipment, clean and nothing to complain, more then its boring and the brown colors just feeling to much sometimes. Breakfast buffet nice and with several choices. I had problem to pay with my credit card upon check out, and they wasn't to helpful with this.We stayed here during a package trip to China and would never stay here again, just because I prefer a more hip and upper standard hotels - and there are several choices in Beijing for a not to much supplement."
10,64,"Jun 11 2008 	Good location and price-quality ratio	The hotel is strategically located and in a nice neighbourhood where you can stroll around or find a non-touristy spot for dinner. The metro stop is a good ten minutes walk but with a taxi you can reach most locations very easily. Rooms are nice, clean and spacious. Breakfast is good. On the down side service is patchy and the internet is exhorbitantly expensive.They also offer basic large hotel services like booking of tourist excursions. There is a theatre in the hotel where you can see some chinese opera or acrobatics (but we did not go)."
11,64,"Jan 27 2008 	Hao Shie Shie Ni !	I stayed in this hotel right smack in the middle of winter January, 2008. I enjoyed my stay there. The staff were very attentive to my needs. They are always on hand to help with directions, they right down in chinese the direction for the cab driver. Evryone tries to speak english. The room was typical, clean and spacious. The breakfast buffet was laid out with a good selection of food. You can literally stuff yourself for the busy day ahead. Only drawback is the main shopping center is a cab away, a short one though. The location of Merry Mart right across is great for grocery needs. Overall, I would stay again in this hotel."
12,64,"Jan 13 2008	nice hotel	I stayed at this hotel in beijing only for three nights, but i can't complain. the room was clean, comfortable and a nice size compared with european rooms. the breakfast was good and the neiborhood was ok. i'd go back"
13,64,"Dec 8 2007	* Great Hotel *	Great Hotel; very modern, lovely rooms, good food and wonderful &amp; helpful staff but English was not their strong suit. I would, however, recommend this hotel to anyone &amp; everyone. R.O., Sweden"
14,64,"Nov 22 2007	Good hotel reasonable location atrocious food	Stayed here for 4 nights as part of a tour group. The hotel itself is lovely - sparkling clean with plenty of amenities and clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff in foyer bar, shops and reception. Visiting the gorgeous in-house theatre for the opera is an experience not to be missed.Location-wise it's ok, but would have preferred somewhere more central. You can't just nip into central Beijing from here.The real downside, however, was the food. As a tour group we were definitely second class citizens, fed in our own room with stone cold gristle, fat and rice, rice, rice. Restaurant staff were off-hand and uninterested. They seemed to want to usher us in, feed us this abominable matter and get us out again as quickly as possible.Maybe the restaurants you pay for separately are ok, but if you're thinking of going on a tour and they are using this hotel, I would seriously look at another tour operator."
15,64,"Nov 17 2007	Good location a bit out of the tourist zone	We stayed here for four nights and I was quite happy. Our rooms were nothing special but were clean and quiet. The building is about 50 years old and was probably an important place at one time, but no more.It seemed to me the hotel was mostly full of European tour groups (and I will never complain about rude Americans again). It is busy and the staff seem a bit challenged trying to keep all the foreigners happy, but overall they manage it, except for pleasing some of the more demanding types who don't realize they are in a different part of the world.The location is a bit out of the tourist zone in a very Chinese neighbourhood. Nothing to be afraid of just a nice regular neighbourhood with not alot there to cater specifically to tourists. Lots of shops and restaurants though.Tiananmen is a good 45 minute walk for me, but the Temple of Heaven is 20 minutes straight down the road. If you aren't a big walker take the taxi, they are cheap and will have you there in 10 minutes.Our room included the breakfast buffet which was average at best. The restaurants in the hotel were also average at best. If you are tired of Chinese food there is a McDonalds a couple of blocks away.I really have no complaints about this hotel. It is not a special place but it is good value and a nice location. You can't go wrong here if you have realistic expectations."
16,64,"Nov 6 2007 	nice hotel	A 3-star hotel with a 4-star feel. It's reasonably priced and clean with TV. Location wise about 50mins walk to Tiananmen Sq and a 20mins walk to the metro. Perfect for couples, tour groups (older tourists) and business. Not appropriate for single travellers who want to meet other travellers."
17,64,Oct 27 2007 	Hotel tip	Nice hotel. Not to expensive. Near city-highlites
18,64,"Jul 21 2007 	Good tourists location in Beijing	Arrived off an early morning flight and were made very welcome, and room ready after breakfast. That's a good start! The room is good, if in need of a some detail cleaning ;-) Free internet is not free, but I'm learning that it's like that in China. Much advertising and/or internet offers don't actually match what is on offer when you get there. The location is good, we walked from the Forbidden City to the hotel one day in about 45 minutes; and walked to the Temple of Heaven about 30 minutes another day. The area seems pretty safe to wander (all of China does actually) and there was a couple of good restaurants nearby. The hotels own restaurants are above average too."
19,64,"Jul 2 2007 	Can recommend this hotel	Like many of the reviewers, we found this hotel lovely. There was a pleasant feel about the place, staff were friendly, fixtures &amp; fittings excellant. Good size, quality beds &amp; bathroom.The only slight downside was the Marco Polo restaurant, which served the western breakfast - we followed a large group in for an early breakfast &amp; clearly the staff had made no attempt to clear any tables. It is quite small (without any natural light) - so if you have a strict timetable to meet - be warned!We had a one meal in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel - ground floor, which was fine - but otherwise we went out. You must visit the &quot;ducK&quot; restaurant (Quanjade Roast Duck Restaurant)- its 30 mins walk - its easier &amp; certainly cooler to take a taxi for 10 Y. For a local meal, we went to one recommended by the concierge - turn right outside hotel, cross the road by pelican crossing to the other side of Yongan road (i.e. on opposite side to large supermarket) and carry on down road for about 100 m - it is the 2nd restaurant &amp; has pink tablecloths (1st restaurant does not have any tablecloths &amp; is clearly not as popular with the locals)"
20,64,"Apr 11 2007 	Very pleased	Reasonably priced. Very nice hotel, beautiful lobby and corridors, comfortable room, clean with all amenities. We paid extra for internet in the room. Subway is about 1 km away, but city bus service to subway (#14 or 15) is frequent and will get you there if you choose not to walk. Some good local food nearby (a little place at 48-2 Beiwei Lu serves excellent porridge, breakfast/ lunch dishes, inexpensive and clean) and Weiduomei Bakery at corner of Hufang Lu and Beiwei Lu makes fresh, excellent pastries, and the cost is very low. Hotel food is decent and good, but not outstanding for the price."
21,64,Feb 2 2007	Great for Group Travel	We stayed here a part of an Australian school group travelling through China and had a fantastic experience. The hotel staff were always friendly and spoke fair to good english. If they weren't sure what you were asking they always checked with someone else. The rooms were really spacious and always clean. Buffet breakfast daily was great with a wide selection available to suit everyone. Also close to restaurants which were fantastic for food and price. The supermarket across the road was good for supplies and an experience on it's own. Although not within walking distance to venues the public transport was a great experience. We always travelled in groups so weren't worried about going out to restaurants etc. at night. The staff will always write down where you want to go in chinese to give to taxis which is a big help and the hotel's card is all you have to give drivers to get home. Staff have a good idea of how much it will cost also which is good to get sorted out with the driver before you start. Taxis come to the hotel door. Hawkers in the street outside are part of the experience and will leave you alone if you say &quot;No Thank You&quot;. Local shops are fairly priced also so don't be afraid to have a look. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Beijing and would stay there again!
22,64,"Jul 23 2006 	Terrific hotel	My wife, 20 month old daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights on our trip to Beijing from Australia. We found the hotel rooms to be very large and extremely comfortable. When we arrived a very new looking cot had already been set up for us in the room (and was provided at no charge) which was terrific.Breakfast was buffet style and had everything you could want. There is a large, locally used, supermarket across the road where we were able to buy milk, juice, nappies etc. it was a great experience just to shop there.We were a short Taxi ride to all tourist venues. (less than 10 minutes and about 10- 12 Yuen) and could possibly have walked to most if we were without our 20 month old!! The hotel is out of the CBD in south Beijing and for us this allowed us to see more of the local Chinese then just being in a CBD area in a western hotel.All facilities were great and the staff were always very helpful.Highly recommended for tourists, and families."
23,64,Jun 3 2006	Qianmen hotel was a great experience	The Qianmen hotel was located in an interesting area of Beijing. It was convenient to Tiananmen Square and the Temple of Heaven. The room was very nice and the included breakfast buffet was excellent. The staff was pleasant and helpful.The Liyuan Theatre is located in the hotel (interesting). I would recommend this hotel highly.
24,64,"Oct 25 2005	Great Hotel For The Price	Considering it was only US$60 a night I was pleasantly surprised. The room was tidy, the staff were great and it was an ideal place to use as a base for my travels.The staff spoke good English which helped. If I wanted a taxi the staff would go out on the street and get me one, and they would always write my destination in chinese to give to the taxi driver. I found them to be fantastic, considering how cheap the price was."
25,64,"Sep 8 2005	Not bad but not great. 2 star.	This hotel was a shock to us after travelling from Hong Kong and staying in five star luxury there. I will start with the positive aspects. The staff is very friendly and speaks fair to good english. The on site restaurants had a good choice of food for both breakfast and dinner, and the service there was friendly and very good. For the price the hotel charges, this may be a good property for those looking to save a little on lodging. There is no Western standard here, but this may be good for travelers whom want to escape that and feel what a local hotel in China is like. The lobby is somewhat comfortable to sit and have a drink and watch people come and go. There is a theatre and two gift shops in the lobby. This hotel appears to cater to many European travelers. As for the negative aspects, the hotel is far from any tourist interests. There is, however, a subway station near by. It was a 10-15 minute cab ride to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. One couldn't walk to much of anything. As soon as you leave the hotel property, you may be approached by street vendors trying to sell something. They are however easy to say &quot;no thank you&quot; to and will leave you alone very shortly. The area surrounding the hotel can make a traveler feel a bit apprehensive to venture out on his or her own. The area doesnt feel that safe and seems a little poor. Simply crossing the street near the hotel, and in Beijing, can be quite a challenge, especially for those not used to traffic chaos and a seemingly free for all rush. Our room was very outdated, worn out and a little dirty. The hotel feels like it is stuck in the 60's as far as design is concerned.If we return to Beijing someday, we would certainly not stay here again"

1,67,"Nov 22 2009	Joy City Hotel Beijing	right next to shopping complex, very convenient location!"
2,67,Oct 15 2009 	Room is OK service horrible	I booked my room trough latestays.com . They didnt like that I had the lowest rate possible . They let me know that when checking in by being extremely rude. Staff is very unhelpfull here. Staff does not speak english only chinese. Some speak very little english but dont actually understand a word you say. Only if you keep it very very simple they might understand you but even then usually they wont. Rooms dont get cleaned on a daily basis . Someone of the cleaning staff comes in your room and pretends to clean it. Not even your bed gets made up properly. If you can get the lowest possible rate and you have to be in this area you can stay here. Aslong as you dont minde the rude staff and except for the room you dont need anything from the hotel. I should aslo mention that the hotel is very loud . You can hear the people in the room next to you and you can hear people in the hallways making lots of noises .
3,67,"Oct 7 2009 	My 'HOME' away from home.	Typing this review from my hotel room as it has free internet access!!We were upgrade to a 2 Bedroom suite so you can say that our stay was great! Our suite consisted of 2 bedrooms, a hall with a kitchen (complete with electric kettle, washing machine, microwave machine, full-size fridge and a stove top cooker)! There is a 60&quot; HDTV in each bedroom and also in the hall. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms lovely. We had our 5-night stay so we REALLY made use of most of the kitchen, right down to washing our clothes for the long stay.The hotel is right next to a hugh shopping mall - Joy City Shopping Mall. That's great as we can find good and cheap food on the 6th, 7th and 8th floor. The mall has many shops which sold many good quality products of international brands.Breakfast spread was really quite good and a great way to start our day of fun and shopping!!TIP: The mall is connected to the hotel via a security door on the ground floor. You just have to swipe your hotel room card at the security detector point (on the mall side) and the door will lead you to the hotel lift lobby."
4,67,"Aug 4 2009 	A perfect stay	My husband and I stayed there for several nights right after Chinese new year. I asked my brother to book through http://www.ctrip.com/. The rate was 398/night, quite reasonable for standard room and we were upgraded to a business suite. The suite is modern and clean. There is a bedroom and a living room with open kitchen. I actually invited friends to come and have a cup of tea before dining out. Location is perfect, close to subway and airport bus, 5 to 10 minutes walk. There are several shopping malls around with nice restaurants. It was a perfect stay and great value for the money."
5,67,"Jun 29 2009 	In need of housekeeping!	I stayed there for 10 days in May. I had a large &amp; bright corner room but the place is not as clean as one would expect. Mildew around the tiles in the shower and dozens of greassy fingerprints on the door were the most obvious. I complained to reception but didn't see much difference. By the way, reception was not the most efficient except for a young german lady. It took them 2 days &amp; a lot of explanations to understand I was not checking out but only moving from a solo traveler status to part of a group.It's too bad because the nearby subway station &amp; the adjacent huge shopping mall with 3 storeys of restaurants make the location interesting."
6,67,"Jun 25 2009 	valuable hotel in Beijing	I booked this hotel though a china travel website. We stayed 4 nights in there. The hotel is better than our expectations. First, it upgraded as business room for double bed. The room is clean, big and good in fecilities. The services is acceptable. At least, they respond quickly to my request. The quality of breakfast is fairly good, the staff pick off the dishes as well. The kettle is dirty and carpet is dirty. Location is excellent. The bell-boy can speck English."
7,67,"May 14 2009 	Great intro to China	We found the staff to be very friendly, room was comfortable however more attention needs to be taken with cleaning the floors as there were black hairs everywhere. Unfortunately the bed was VERY hard something you don't need after a 20 hour flight. Great location with access to a shopping centre and ATM's via a walkway on the 6th floor. Great breakfast with heaps to choose from both western and asian style cuisine. Also, love the bar in the lobby - the barman is a gem and a pretty good snooker player.We had fun.TIP: If using the fridge in your room leave the cupboard door ajar so the heat from the motor can escape - we found it worked better that way."
8,67,"Jan 29 2009 	Quiet clean comfortable	My children and I enjoyed staying in this hotel over the Christmas period. The rooms were clean, warm and roomy.They had all the necesary amenities in the room. Our holiday package included breakfast. And again, my children and I enjoyed the great variety of breakfast put out by the hotel. However, the restaurant were pretty packed during breakfast and they didn't have enough waiters and waitresses to clear the tables.One thing, do not lose your room key card. A member of our tour group lost her card and had to pay RMB50 to get a new one."
9,67,"Jan 24 2009	NEVER AGAIN. joy city hotel	The hotel looks good, and the first inpression of the room is not bad. then you take of the shoes and you look for the slippers and you note that there are long hairs in the corridor and in the room, so you look in the toilet and in the SHOWER and there are HAIRS too.i've called 3 times the service to clean the room but the hairs were still there. about the GLASSES are dirty and if you complain, thery are cleened with a towel... not changed.if you complain at the front desk thay says that is a problem they know and offers you to change the room but will not send someone to clean the room.the laundry service is a fine.never had such a dirty room neither a such bad service."
10,67,"Jan 23 2009	Great location excellent stay	Stayed here 4 nights in January with our China Spree tour group. The hotel is connected to the Joy City shopping mall which was very convenient. There is an enclosed walkway from both the lobby and the 6th floor between the hotel and the mall. There are 4 ATM's on the 6th floor of the mall just beyond the hotel - this was super convenient since we arrived in China late on a Friday and would not be able to get local currency easily. The subway is about 2 blocks away, with elevated walkways over the main streets.Beautiful room: modern and clean with an excellent view. Beware, some rooms overlook or look right into the mall. Instant coffee and tea for free in the room, also 2 bottles of drinking water each day. Our room was very hot, and the thermostat did not work properly, otherwise I would give a 5 star rating. Luckily the window opens, so we could get some fresh cool air."
11,67,"Nov 17 2008	Quiet clean hotel after long flight!	We stayed here for 3 nights in November. Our room was extremely nice, clean - nice robe and slippers in room - also tooth brushes, shaving kit and shampoos. Adjacent to many stores and across from restaurants and more stores. Loved walking around after dinner as everything is lit up like Las Vegas. Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful. Breakfast Buffet was great - lots of choices Any questions, i would only be too happy to answer them for you. Beijing is truly a fascinating city!"
12,67,"Oct 28 2008	Joy at Joy City	We stayed three nights at the Joy City Hotel in Beijing with our tour group. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We asked for a room with a king sized bed and found the room to be much larger than a room with two single beds. The staff at the Joy City were curtious and professional. A buffet breakfast was served daily and was quite good (not great). Eggs cooked to order and a nice selection of western and Asian food. Plenty of room in the dining room.The hotel is also attached to a shopping mall that is accessible on the ground floor. The pool area on the sixth floor was very nice and the staff very attentive. Two bottles of complimentary water are in the room as well as a mini bar selection. Two toothbrushes, toothpaste, comb, razor, shampoo, conditioner are all included in the room. Free coffee and tea are also in the room. A kettle is provided to boil water for drinking.The bed was hard (like all beds in China) but comfortable. Pillows were great.We did not try the restaurants in the hotel other then the buffet each morning. The gift store was never open while we were there. The hotel is a short 2 minute walk to the Xi'dan shopping center. McDonalds, KFC are just around the corner and Starbucks, Dairy Queen and other eateries are located in the six story mall.The reception staff didn't acknowledge us at the counter unless we spoke up first. But, very helpful once you got thier attention. Check out takes a bit longer than other hotels as they send a person to check your room for additional charges before you leave."
13,67,"Sep 22 2008 	New hotel - lots to learn	I was there with work (as were many of my colleagues) and while I didn't have many issues with the room I was staying in I've heard some stories of issues!!My room was a large room with 2 single beds, a kitchenette area and a bathroom (with only shower). It was always at the right temperature and I could get 3 international channels on the telly (BBC world news, CNN and HBO movies). There was a dvd player also (but I didn't use this as I'd not taken any dvd's with me!)I had heard of rooms being too cold and that maintenance couldn't turn off the aircon at all despite numerous attempts so people were sleeping in fridges. Generally every bit of services was polite but slow. Checking out was especially tedious as they check your room while you wait to check out!!I'm not sure if it represented good value for money at all but it worked for our organisation in the most part .. I just think they have a lot to learn to speed things up and make it a better place to stay."
14,67,"May 17 2008 	Not really a good value!	Very friendly and helpful staff but not well organized. If you want to change money, they have to look up the rates in the internet. There are no international TV programs available. The breakfast is poor.The hotel was opend in Feb. 08 but already shows the lack of managment. The carpets are dirty, the furniture and wooden parts dispaly scratches, cables and tools of the housekeeping were spread on the floor for the whole day and no work was going on, etc. A better management would see this.I had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on and was disturbed several times in the afternoon and evening for no reason.The use of the internet in the business center ist way to expensive. 5 US$ for ten minutes!I moved on to the &quot;days inn forbidden city&quot; definitely the better choice!"

17,67,Jun 10 2009 	???????????????
1,71, it's great.As I arrived to the hotel I went directly for Brunch and wow..I had so much food I almost felt sick. Food ranging from Cantonese BBQ to German traditional Bratwurst and a huge dessert buffet
2,71, there are a few things that are highly irritating about this place. Overall the Beijing Kempinski is a pretty good place to stay. the 2 bedroom we're in is spacious. The decor looks pleasant but lived in. The beds are large and comfortable
3,71, we were happy with the facilities. Every hotel staff could manage some English although we had to repeat/rephase our enquires to clarify matters. A supermarket is located within the Lufthansa Youyi Shopping City (just next to the hotel) where we could buy our daily supply of mineral water. We also liked the Korean restaurant there (next to the supermarket) as it served authentic Korean food. The hotel is also conveniently located for our sightseeing trips.	
4,71, the first 5***** in Beijing for all that!  Good breakfast
5,71, after a short 15-20 minute (55RMB) ride from the airport. Perfect since I was only staying there for a oine night layover.Was greeted at the entrance by the bellman
6,71, inadequate towels and pillows
7,71, wide selection and good quality. It is not cheap but a convenient place to stay.I would like to see WLAN in there
8,71, I think this would be a pleasant place to stay while visiting the city.	
9,71, 2007.The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. Most had a very good knowledge of English. The concierge was most helpful in recommending restauraunts in the area within walking distance.The breakfast buffet each morning was the BEST we have ever experienced. The variety of food was remarkable. It was so good that I made it a point to personnaly thank the food service manager AND write a letter to the hotel manager.You cannot go wrong staying at the Kempinski Hotel. A shopping center is connected to the hotel with a super market in the lower level for extra bottled water and snacks.	
10,71, with nice and well-equiped rooms and friendly professional service. It has three restaurants in the property (so you can choose between italian
11,71, so you will always find help when you need it. The breakfast buffet is splendid. I do not understand the complaint of the first reviewer about it. I know the breakfast from many 5* hotels and this one is one of the best of them all - if not the best. The Paulaner beergarden brews its own German-style beer on site and is a great feature for German travellers (such as myself) longing for something familiar
12,71, the rooms need a refurbishment in the next time. Yes
13,71, the location is good
1,73,Nov 18 2009 	OK hotel past it's prime	The hotel seems fairly old and could do with some renovation. The rooms are clean and reasonable size. Although a serviced apartment with a kitchen there was no crockery or pots and pans. Location is good - 10 mins walk from nearest subway station and 5 mins to central shopping area and 20mins to Forbidden City
2,73,"Sep 21 2009 	Loved it!!	We (3 friends) stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and thought it was fantastic. The apartment was nicely furnished and very clean. The location was excellent, well situated to Wanfujing area, markets, and restaurants and easy taxi ride to all sights. The staff were great. The pool and restaurant were also excellent. I would easily stay here again and recommend it to friends."
3,73,Aug 23 2009 	Happy Days- All Good	My wife and I spent 4 nights at Lee Gardens and had a fantastic time. The location was fantastic being very close to the main pedestrian areas downtown and also close to the subway. Th rooms were very tidy and fully self contained. Best of all the staff were brilliant. If we were to return to Beijing we will be staying at Lee Gardens.
4,73,"Aug 19 2009 	Great Option in Beijing for Families and Excellent Value	Stayed at Lee Garden for a week in the summer. The location is right in the Wanfujing area which makes it very convenient to hit the key spots around the locale. Rooms were well portioned like a comfortable apartment and it's great to have a quasi-home to come back to with a separate living area, dining table, kitchen, washer/dryer, etc. all within the apartment after a long day.The staff was helpful, especially the guys manning the doorway to get cabs for you. There's a convenience store around the corner to stock up on drinks, food, snacks, etc. And the dining options are abundent in the whole Wangfujing area. You can walk to the Forbidden City's east gate entrance fairly easily.Fantastic value for a 2-bedroom unit especially when compared to getting 2 rooms in a regular hotel in the same area. Would definitely stay again. Would recommend shopping around various travel sites and contacting the hotel/apartment directly to get the best quotes. The quotes we got were significantly different between Expedia, ctrip, etc."
5,73,"Oct 8 2008 	A Good Property - Certainly Worth Considering	I stayed here during the Olympic/Paralympic periods and was quite pleased. Its about a 4-star property, the staff are very nice and accommodating and the hotels location is fantastic.I stayed in the studio apartment and was comfortable enough (the beds are terribly firm, but this is quite common in China). The kitchen was tiny, but had everything I needed; the washer/dryer was puzzling at first, but easy to use after the first try; and the internet connection was fairly strong. I was staying for about five weeks and found the closet area a bit cramped and poorly designed (or perhaps the room was poorly arranged because one of the closet doors swung open into the couch). For the most part, its a clean hotel, but the carpet is my room was quite stained, so it gives the room a certain worn look.Some colleagues were staying at the same property as me and some of them had one, two and even three-bedroom apartments. These are much more spacious and well-kept it seems. If you are considering the studio, I recommend looking into the cost of the one-bedroom.The hotel gym is very good  lots of equipment to choose from. There are yoga/pilates classes and a pool, too.As mentioned, the location is excellent. Lee Gardens is just steps from the Wangfujing area  AMP Mall is a block away and Oriental Plaza is about a 7 minute walk. There are several high-end five-star properties in this area (Peninsula, Regent, Legendale), as well. Its a pretty dynamic area of Beijing, there are plenty of places to eat and shop  I certainly recommend the fifth and sixth floors at AMP.Overall, Lee Gardens Service Apartment Beijing is a good choice for the business traveller or vacationer who is looking for a cheaper, yet more spacious alternative to the typical 4-star accommodation  without having to sacrifice location, amenities or comfort."
6,73,"May 17 2008 	Good but has some weaknesses.	This is not really a hotel but a &quot;serviced apartment.&quot; Some people stay for a short time but others live there for months or years. I staid here for one month. On the whole it was good but I am not sure if it is the best value that you can get.It is clean and its rooms are of course more typical of an apartment than a hotel. They are equipped with full kitchens and laundry machines. The bathrooms are large and elegant. The location is excellent. It is in Wangfujing, one of the major shopping areas of Beijing and close to shopping and the subway. I also liked their cafe in the basement which gives pretty good food for reasonable prices.The service while good, however, is not quite what it would be at a hotel with a smilar price. They clean your room twice a week instead of everyday if you sign a monthly lease. And it does not have some of the other minor perks that many hotels in China will give you (free bottled water, money changing etc).The apartment was generally in good condition but there were minor problems. My bathroom sink could never deliver hot water and did not drain properly. My washer/dryer machine needed to be replaced because its drying function did not work properly. Even the new machine could only handle small loads and took hours to finish them.If you are staying in Beijing for a while it is probably possible to get an equally nice apartment without twice weakly maid service for a much lower cost. If you are staying for a short time and don't need a larger apartment you might be better off staying at a similarly priced hotel like Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing.But still, I can't really complain too much about my stay here. It was convenient and satisfying if not spectacular."
7,73,"Jun 14 2007 	Serviced Apartment close to Beijing sites	I was a little apprehensive to stay here after i saw some of the past reviews about the place being dirty,etc. We traveled with our eight month old son and really needed to stay in a serviced apartment, for the kitchen and extra space. I have to say we had a wonderful time. I am so glad we stayed here. The reception staff were a bit cold and reserved, but the doorman was extra friendly and helpful. We stayed in an one bedroom apartment for five nights, which was really nice. I asked in advance from the reception staff for pots, pans,etc(since they don't seem to keep them standard in the apartment-you have to ask) and used them for my son's food and sterlizing bottles. Our bedroom was very comfy. The bathroom had a shower and soaking tub. The apartment was very clean. I was really worried about this, since my son is crawling, but the carpets were fine. We didn't have breakfast at the property, since we found it pretty expensive. Instead we went to Oriental Plaza (about 10 minute walk) to the grocery store at the bottom of the building and bought groceries. We found that buying groceries at a top of the line(expat) grocery store was cheaper than having breakfast at the hotel. There is a nice business centre on the bottom level. Our room came with a washing machine/dryer which was really helpful during our stay, even though you can get laundry done through the hotel directly. The hotel is close to many attractions. I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and families. Word of warning, the city is under reconstrution due to the olympics. This wasn't a problem for us during our stay, but there is a construction site on one side of the building."
8,73,"Dec 3 2006 	Great value and location very pleased !	Stayed here for 5 nights in November in the one bedroom apartment. The apartment was very spacious, clean (maid service every day) and had good facilities (including internet, gym, pool and a restaurant). I had been unsure whether to try this place or the Tianlun Dynasty hotel which is a few minutes away. I am glad I chose the apartment as it was excellent value being 20 per night cheaper than the hotel for an apartment as opposed to just a room, and is in my opinion in a slightly better location.All staff were courteous and helpful. They assisted us each day with directions and writing down in Chinese the names of places we wanted to go to, so we could give the info to taxi drivers. The location for me was excellent. The shops of Wanfujing are minutes away and so is the Donganmen night food market. The restaurant within the apartment was good but there are also plenty of other good options nearby (esp recommend the food hall in the Oriental Plaza mall). If I go to Beijing again I will definitely stay here and would not hesitate to recommend this place."
9,73,"Jul 28 2006 	Great Location Friendly Staff	We stayed there for a week with another family. Because we have so many children among us, I find the idea of a service apartment an excellent alternative to a hotel, especially since we paid no more, if not less than another hotel inthe area.Location is excellent, it is 3 minutes away from a western-style shopping mall where you can get all kinds of food, some even delivered to the hotel 24/7. McDonalds is also located in the same mall so our children are just happy to have some familiar food for breakfast for the first day. As a result, we never tried breakfast in the hotel.The rooms are very big, even by North American standard. Our one-bedroom apartment is more than 1000 sq ft. My friend's 3-bedroom looks like a maze, with full size mud-room, walk-in closets and everything.Air conditioning is at the right temp. We were in Beijing in the last week of June and it was very hot outside and most malls and taxis do not have good air-conditioning. So it is always nice to walk into the hotel lobby and feel the cool air on you. Not cold, just refreshingly cool.Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. There is always some one who can speak good English on the front desk. Cleaning and housekeeping staff are also friendly and they do a good job too, but they don't usually speak English. I had to talk to Front Desk to get things done and delivered.The kitchen does not contain anything, other than a coffee maker and some cups. But if you ask the Front Desk, they can bring you anything you need to make a meal."
10,73,"Jul 28 2006 	nice apartment at excellent location	We, a family of four with to children aged 9 and 10, stayed for a week at Lee Garden. Staff was friendly, especially the bell boy. They were practising there english and I attended an english lesson for the front deks staff. The lessons are a necessity because there english isnt too good (on the other hand, neither is my chinese). The apartments are spacious and well equipped although there are no kitchen utensils. The gym was allright and there was a large swimming pool. The indeed asked us (as another travller wrote) to use swimming caps. We bought the cheap ones: 10 yuan. My girls liked the pool and it was something they looked forward to over the day when visting a temple or two.Breakfast is expensive and nothing special so you better make your own or go elsewhere. Theres enough in the neighbourhood. Its on walking distance (15 minutes) of the forbidden city and literaly around the corner of the wangfuijing shopping street and nightmarket.An excellent place for families."
11,73,"Jul 5 2006	good location but dirty	First the good news: the location is great: center of the city, close to most tourist things. Very safe with things to do at all hours. Also the bathroom is very nice - clean, modern with a separate shower and bath. Better than I had expected.However, two negatives. 1) it's not clean. It looks clean, however, my two young children discovered tons of soot and dust on the carpet near the windows. It was disgusting. After just a few minutes of playing on the carpet, their hands and knees were covered with black dust. 2) the staff is stereotypically bad. When notified of the dirt, they just shrugged their shoulders and ignored my request to clean it.One more thing, the pool is very nice there, but they require everyone (including the men and children) to wear swim caps. If you buy them there they are 30 Yuan."
12,73,"Mar 18 2006	Perfect place to stay	After a crazy ride from the airport, where our driver could not find this place, we finally arrived to friendly night staff who got us settled in. In the morning we discovered how wonderfully located this place was. It is within walking distance of The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, interesting shopping and a night food stall market. The rooms were quite large with an adequately equiped kitchen. There is a great health club you can use, as well as yoga and other classes you can take. Look no further for accomodation unless you feel the need to spend lots of money for an overpriced fancy hotel."
13,73,Feb 2 2006 	loved the hotel. and the location is the best!	very nice service apartment hotel. the rooms are big with kitchenette. very nice pool. the best location!
1,74,Aug 21 2009 	Most luxurius hotel of the world	I syated at the Legendale Hotel in Beijing for two nights with my wife
1,75,Oct 27 2009 	Great hotel for Americans	Great food..decorated for Christmas with carolers too...very beautiful hotel.
2,75,"Jul 12 2009 	excellent to get away from it all	The Loong palace is a gorgeous hotel and resort , it has fantastic facilities , and is the only place in Beijing you can feel alone......sadly it is because you are . After a hectic eight nights spent in the city touring all the sites it was lovely to just unwind and relax out at the Loong palace, the staff are happy smiling people and the place is five stars without a doubt . The great wall is visable on a clear day and the tombs are not so far away so even if you wanted to base yourself out here it is not so far from everything , It would be wonderful if more people used the hotel and travelled into the sites each day to then come back to quiet luxury of an evening . (it took about 30 mins from the forbidden city to reach the hotel ) small pointer -you need a cap to use the swimming pool ."
3,75,"Jul 7 2009 	An excellent hotel	The hotel is located in the Chang Ping district and is close to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs and institutions such as Peking University. If you want to go to downtown Beijing, it is a 30 minute journey in a reasonably priced hotel car or a cab. The hotel has excellent facilities including indoor tennis courts, a bowling alley, well equipped recreation centre/ gymnasium, pool and a very good massage / spa. The restaurants are very good with an excellent range of cuisines and the Japanese restaurant is outstanding. The rooms are spacious and clean. For what you get, this is excellent value. Highly recommended."
4,75,"May 27 2009 	Loong Palace (aka-Lonely Palace)	The hotel is phenominal, but the problem is that it is in the middle of nowhere, thus as my colleagues call it &quot;the Lonely Palace.&quot; Why? This location is outside of the 5th ring highway (anything beyond the 5th ring is considered the boon-docks). But when I first moved to China, my company housed me at the Loong Palace for a month, and I enjoyed my stay, but being so far away, almost everywhere I wanted to go was a 40-50 RMB (6-7 USD) cab ride away. Although for the US people, 6-7 USD seems like nothing for a cab right, the equivalent for cost of living is that the cab ride is like 35 USD. So if you think about it, cab rides start off at 10 RMB for the first 2.9 KM, and then 1 RMB for every KM you travel. So if you do the math, you will realize how far the place is. I think from Tienneman Square to the Great Wall (Badaling section which is the area that you should go to), this is the halfway point. So if you're thinking in US, if you're going from LA to Vegas, this place would be Barstow. But this hotel is truly a 5-star hotel (as in Ritz Carlton standards). The manager there is Dutch, speaks fluent english and fluent Chinese. And since I had a corporate rate, the month that I stayed there, the total bill for the month came out to 900 USD. Now that's cheaper than the price of rent in NY city for a studio in the city.Like I said, it's not the most convenient of places, but the place is definitely a hidden gem. Also, with all the development going on by there is a new gigantic Japanese mall just north of the hotel which has a Korean Lotteria (burger joint), a Korean restaurant chain, a Sports Authority, and some other international brands."
5,75,"Feb 24 2009	World Class Hotel	The Hotel is very new. Clean, very western in terms of the bathrooms and room furnishings. Traveled with a very large group (350). The breakfasts we had at the Hotel were a mix of western and Chinese dishes."
6,75,"Nov 22 2008	a world class hotel great stay	others who had traveled to beijing warned us that a 5 star hotel in china might not be up to our usual standards. this is an exception. should be rated 5-1/2 stars. great room, outstanding common area facilities.the staff was always ready to help. money exchange, extra towels, business center and written chinese directions for taxi drivers, just a few of the great services.they try hard with english, but the difficulties encountered just added to the interest of traveling in china. my wife and i stayed for 8 days, and for someone who had traveled extensively, this hotel, and china, rated as one of our best travel experiences.john k, modesto ca"
7,75,"Jun 19 2008 	Good business hotel in Beijing	I stayed at the Loong Palace while on a business trip for over 1 1/2 weeks. For business travelers, the club rooms are quite good, spacious clean and great respite from the day's work.The hotel is out in the middle of nowhere, for leisure purposes, its probably better to stay closer to the city either in the Financial District or the Choyang district.Food is good to excellent, the japanese restaurant providing excellent value.Staff was quite courteous and accomodating. Unfortunately, many didn't have sufficient english skills to be of true help."
8,75,"May 4 2008	Amazing Hotel - would definitely stay here again!	We booked our trip through our local community center. They were going through Collette Vacations. At first, I was a bit disappointed that this hotel was a bit far from the city, but it turned out to be centrally located to all of the sites on our trip. The hotel was just beautiful! There were doormen that greeted us each day. The staircase in the lobby was remarkable. Our rooms were perfect...I just can't say enough about how wonderful this hotel was!Room - The bathroom was black marble, with toothbrush, toothpaste, everything you could need. We used our room key to turn on the lights. The room was spotless. They had cans of Coke in the minibar, the kind with the &quot;pull off&quot; tab. I typically do not hit the mini bar - but I had to have one - it reminded me of when I was a kid...before the new fangled tabs that do not come off the can.Dining - We had the breakfast buffet each day. We had PLENTY of western dishes to choose from - omlets, cereal, fresh fruit, hot cereal, the list goes on. There were also Chinese options. The Chinese do not eat eggs/pancakes for breakfast. They eat lunch and dinner type foods for breakfast - and there were a lot of those options as well. We even had a Western Night dinner with Chocolate Cake and ICE CREAM! It was great!On the day we flew to Xian, we had to leave before dawn, and the hotel had boxed up &quot;breakfast&quot; for us. They packed yogurt, a delicious apple, that tasted like a pear, a hard boiled egg, a sandwich, etc. so that we did not go hungry.We had 2 &quot;fancy&quot; dinners at the hotel. One was the &quot;meet and greet&quot; dinner. Lots of chinese cuisine served on lazy susan's. Mostly appetizer types choices...but very good. The other was on our last night. We had a lovely sit down dinner with choice of entrees. Service - The hotel delivered and picked up our luggage for us, we did not have to transport our luggage at all. They were very helpful with exchanging our money and mailing our post cards. The staff spoke plenty of Engish. I did visit the business center to send email to my teenagers who stayed behind with their dad. (calling and emailing hit my wallet the hardest!)I cannot say anything bad about our visit to this hotel. It was truly an amazing visit!"
9,75,"Mar 22 2008 	Very nice hotel far from the city center	We stayed at this hotel for ten days on a combined business/sightseeing trip. We were attending a conference held at this hotel; otherwise we probably would not have booked it since it is is very far from the city center.However, we found the hotel to be an excellent choice. The property is beautiful and has all the amenities expected of a good five-star hotel (pool, spa, shopping, gym, tennis, bowling...). There are many excellent restaurants on-site, which is good since there is not much else in this area. The restaurants were generally rather pricey by Beijing standards, but still much cheaper than we were used to so we didn't mind. The rooms were very spacious, immaculately clean and well-decorated. The bathrooms were very large with lovely furnishings. Free bottled water was provided in the rooms since the tap water isn't safe to drink. In-room internet access is available for a cost - however you pay only when logged on, and while we were online frequently the total cost for the stay was negligible.We paid a very reasonable 650 yuan per night, including the buffet breakfast which was very extensive, and excellent quality. There are of course much cheaper hotels in Beijing, but this seems to be a good price for a five-star hotel.The location is the main downside, since it does take some time to get into the center. However we found it to be simple and inexpensive: a five-minute taxi to LongZe station (12 yuan every time), followed by the line 13 train and the line 2 subway (5 yuan total). It took up to an hour but again, was quite simple. Note that it's not really possible to walk anywhere from this hotel, since the highway is very close."
10,75,"Dec 7 2007	Make sure to check out the spa	Very nice and clean hotel. Most desk staff speak a little English, but double check important details. Breakfast buffet is very nice. The huge spa is something not to be missed. Prices are most reasonable. I prefered the 9th floor spa to the services offered in the pool area (better ambience, though the pool area is cheaper).In restaurants, order your meat more cooked than you like it. Ours tended to keep coming our rarer than we'd prefer.It is in the ourskirts of town, so not necesarily convenient, but great value for the money, and taxis are cheap(make sure you only get in metered taxis!). Have fun!"
11,75,Sep 6 2007	Can't miss	Wonderful Hotel. One of the best I've stayed in anywhere in the world. We stayed in the new section just opened in March '07. Wonderful breakfast buffet also. We were on a tour so the distance to the city wasn't an issue. Conveneient to the Great Wall and the Olympic stadium but maybe too far for business downtown.
12,75,"Sep 6 2007 	Top Notch Hotel!	I've stayed here twice now...Both times just transiting through Beijing on my way back to the states...Flew in the night before and left the next morning or afternoon. The first time I stayed there was about 2 years ago...I booked it through Crowne Plaza's website. I arrived 3 days after it dropped the Crowne Plaza affiliation...Which scared me a bit. I was thinking before getting there &quot;Uh-oh, the place wasn't up to C/P standards!&quot; I couldn't have been more wrong. A GORGEOUS hotel, so big, such great rooms--big, clean, comfortable, many amenities...I could go on and on. My second trip there, I arrived late at night and was flying back to the States the next afternoon...Which allowed me to visit the Great Wall at BaDaLing in the morning and still catch my flight. I arranged a hotel car to take me there, wait for me for a few hours and drive me back to the hotel so I could freshen up before my flight...A GREAT experience. I had the hotel car for about 4 hours and ran me about US$100. Well worth it to finally see the wall. 4 trips to China each year X 10 years and still hadn't seen the Great Wall until that trip! Car driver was friendly, although almost no English spoken (thank God I speak some Chinese).Superb hotel, GREAT value. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra US$20 and book a small suite. Well worth it.Ate one meal in the Chinese restaurant...Great food, reasonable prices and fantastic service.While it is relatively close to the Great Wall and the airport, it is a long way from the City Center. The PERFECT hotel for doing what I did--fly in quick for one night, see the wall and fly out. One of these days I will make it into the city, but will have a tough time staying away from Loong Palace!"
13,75,"Aug 2 2007	The Best of Service	Our Beijing vacation stay ended July 30, 2007 and it was the best vacation my wife and I ever experienced. Our room 8512 was beautiful and bright. The staff was outstanding, always very helpful and answered all our questions. My wife and I hope to someday return. The best wishes and long life to the entire staff.Hank Hammersmith and Lan Ying MiDiamond Bar, CAUSA"
14,75,Jul 9 2007	Amazing Hotel with best service	We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group based out of Hong Kong. Have to say it was so luxurious. downside is amenities had to be paid for so couldn't really do anything else once you got to the hotel. Rooms were superb and breakfast had a great variety. Rooms were very large with a spacious bathroom. Felt like home. Great view of back terrace. Had nothing to complain about. Very remote location. About 70 Yuan Taxi ride to city center...check out the silk market but be prepared to bargain ridiculously. :D
15,75,"May 25 2007 	Had a great stay !	Just returned from another trip to Loong Palace and the improvements regarding service I have seen are getting better - especially for China.The Restaurants still need improving regarding service although the menus had changed for the better since my last visit in February.This time I went with my wife and we had a few days of leisure together which was a nice break from the usual buisness trip and I had a chance to properly explore all the leisure facilities which are really good and well maintained.Although the hotel was really busy with an International Taekwondo event she was really taken care of, especially at their new Spa in their new South Wing called My Spa which is certainly one of the best we have seen in Beijing.The understanding of English also seems to be improving as one member of staff told me they now have regular English lessons.I hope they keep it up as I will be going back in Sptember."
16,75,"May 23 2007 	Excellent Hotel	A brilliant Hotel with excellent facilities, friendly staff and good resturants.Rooms are large, well serviced, and well appointed room service is fast and efficient.Business facilites were good, and it is well located in relation to the high tech districts.The Great Wall and other major sightseeing areas are within easy reach.I will be staying there again."
17,75,"Mar 29 2007	Excellent accomodations.	Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace. It is a lovely hotel deserving of it's 5 star rating. The employees were very helpful, very accomodating. Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money, asking about areas we wanted to visit, ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants, even getting a massage. This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous."
18,75,"Mar 5 2007 	Excellent Rooms 	The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious, and the staff is excellent. Yes, as several reviews have pointed out, English skills are often lacking, but a little bit of patience goes a long way. Besides...you are in China after all..how fluent is your Chinese? The hotel has several restaurants (excellent breakfast in the Bravo on 2nd floor), a spa, bowling alley, tennis court, and other amenities to fill your free time (assuming you have any). I will definitely stay at the Loong Palace again. Top notch! The ONLY negative for anyone travelling strictly for pleasure is the location (45 minute cab ride from downtown)."
19,75,"Dec 8 2006 	Service Challenged	The hotel is quite beautiful inside and the rooms are furnished well, but it is a typical Chinese business in that the service is non-existent and they do not attempt to proactively provide assistance. In regards to meals, don't even attempt to order room service in English unless you have a sedative and alot of patience. I stay here for business due to the location, but after spending several weeks on-site I will be staying downtown in January and paying the extra cab fare to avoid the poor customer service."
20,75,"Jul 4 2006	Nice Hotel but fair customer service	I have been on vacation with my family to Beijing, and we stayed at the Loong Palace Hotel throughout our 5 day journey.The hotel is in some remote outskirts of the city, but travelling has been reasonable. The rooms are nice, clean and big. The bathroom have also been in good condition. Variety of TV channels and breakfast have also been good.However, what annoys me most has been the customer service. My father and I went to access the internet at its Business Center one evening. We checked for the price at Front Desk beforehand, and was told the first 30 mins would cost RMB $32. Fine. Even though a bit expensive, it's not over the top.We went to the Biz Center then, checked a couple of emails for around 25+ mins. When we are about to checkout and pay, a bill of RMB $80 has been sent in. It came as a real shock. Subseqeuntly, we found out that the billing was &quot;First 10 mins would cost RMB $32, and then $1 per min afterwards&quot;.We feel cheated by the Hotel, and summoned the Duty Manager for reasoning. Sarcastically, he offered fruit plates as remedy, but insisted the full bill to be paid. He also guaranteed an investigation and refund us in full if the mistake has been made by his staff.The following evening, the Manager returned with an evelope of RMB $8. He said it has been clarified that his staff made a mistake, but the billing of internet has also been posted in the Biz Ctr, and he claimed we should have checked again before using the service. The RMB $8 is a 10% refund to show the &quot;goodwill&quot; of hotel. He even claimed that this event had the endorsement of his GM and there'd be no use if we keep complaining. We refused to take the refund and walked away. I think the handling is totally unacceptable, given that the mistake has been made by his staff, and the impolite manner of the Manager. It's not a matter of paying extra for the service, but the breakdown of trust and expectation from a &quot;5-star hotel&quot;. How can such a hotel in service for several years with front desk staff unaware of the pricing of its own service ?I'd say other than this unpleasant experience, the whole journey has been enjoyable. However, this incident spoilt our journey."
21,75,"Jan 6 2006	Great Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with a tour group. The hotel was beautiful and clean. The food in the restaurants was good with a good selection. The staff was friendly and helpful, although not all of them spoke english. The hotel is located out from the city center, but a cab ride downtown was only $8 to $10. It was quiet and had a large indoor swimming pool. I would definitely stay there again."
22,75,Nov 23 2005	Excellent Service from staff but a little far	I had a tour group of children and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us. The facilities were fantastic and we especially liked the swimming pool which was free and supervised. The hotel was a little far from Beijing but that didn't spoil our enjoying being there. I would certainly recommend it to anyonw.
23,75,"Nov 17 2005	Excellent Hotel	I stayed there for a week. The amenities at this hotel are among the best by far of any other I have stayed in. The employees for the most part spoke broken english, but well enough to hold a decent conversation. There were quite a few, however, that spoke english very well. The food at the Palms restaurant on premises was very good, with many, many choices available to satisfy the hunger cravings of almost anyone. The choices range from western to asian cusine, with very well prepared on both. Not only would I recommend to anyone, I plan on going back and staying at this same hotel."
24,75,Oct 20 2005	Very Poor	Just spent a miserable time at this hotel. The building is actually very nice and the room big. The problem is service and lack of English speaking staff. Impossible to order room service food and when it arrived it was not at all what we ordered. The coffee shop was packed with noisy tourist groups and was a mess both mornings. Virtually no one at the reception desk could understand basic English. Could not tell me where the executive club loounge was???Pretty hotel but avoid at all costs because of service.
25,75,"Sep 26 2005	Nice but not a Crowne Plaza Any longer	Booked by a friend and found out upon arrival it is no longer a Crowne Plaza. It is called Loong Palace Hotel and Resort. Could not believe all the recreational activites available, even a movie theatre (not open though). Weekend BBQ in the garden was super.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Nice big clean rooms and good price value."
26,75,May 11 2009 	Tout simplement nul ...
1,76,Sep 11 2009	Luxury serviced resident cheats people... be careful	We have booked this hotel through booking.com and cancel the booking 3 weeks before the booking date. According cancel condition this should cost 0 USD. After our trip to China we discovered the Luxery serviced resedent has charged us for 1 night even the booking.com has confirmed the fault of the hotel. The hotel will not return money at once. The manager said it will take 3 months to refund the money. After a lot of communication the Luxury serviced resident stops communcate with us.... So what can we do ... the booking.com will not take the responsibility as well. We can not do any thing else than just wait....That why: don't ever ever give your credit card information to this hotel. They will cheat you and don't care any thing about customers satifation
2,76,"Sep 2 2009 	Okay stay for family	We stayed for three nights in a two bedroom apartment which was very spacious and had heaps of space for the four of us. The location is good with the main road only five minutes up the road, heaps of buses going downtown for next to nothing and lots of atms around for cash. There is a 7/11 across the carpark - cheap beer and snacks - there is quite a smell in there and I don't know about eating some of the food in the heating servers. The front desk were helpful and always smiling. The only issue was cleanliness of the apartment - it didn't really feel hotel clean but it was okay - though we did have to keep the kitchen door closed the whole time. We didn't bother eating at MCS as the food was very average and even with the breakfast included in the price we decided that cornflakes and milk from 7/11 was better. There was a great restaurant up the road about 5 mins walk called De Tai Lou - nice food, reasonable price and walking distance after a few drinks - the menu is a laugh. Chips or french fries are called &quot;Department of the Bombing&quot; - the kids had them every meal just to say it. Overall the apartment is okay, space for a family of four (sharing beds), the 7/11 is handy, good location and the De Tai Lou is lovely for a meal."
3,76,"Jul 8 2009 	just okay	We stayed in this hotel last October. We had some mixed feelings about the place - some good, some bad, but none fantastic or horrible.First impressions were mixed. We were arriving late at night and once we navigated into the city and onto the street of the hotel it took us 20 minutes to actually find the place. It's not directly on the road, but off in a plaza, with no well lit signage at night and no direct driveway. Our poor taxi driver didn't know where it was either, and we just kept circling around. Finally we spotted it, and had to lug our bags over a grassy median and through a parking lot to get to the hotel.The reception staff was extremely friendly, a young woman who was very enthusiastic even at the late hour. Her english was pretty good.The hotel itself feels old and creaky, but it's not necessarily a negative thing. The main halls and lobby all seemed quite clean and well cared for. There are two elevators to access the rooms.The room itself was a one bedroom loft. A split level with living/dining/kitchen/bathroom on main floor, and bedroom/shower/bathroom on top floor. It's rare to find a one bedroom two bathroom hotel room. The shower is a wet room style - you shower over the sink and among some grimy looking pipes. The furniture seemed clean but not new, the rooms were the same. They were definitely not spotless (lots of dust and grime in the bathrooms, cracks along the walls), but they were not filthy enough to make us uncomfortable - no bugs or real causes for concern, just well worn. The bed sheets were relatively clean (I had a black smudge on my pillow case). Generally we were happy with our choice - great location, good service, rooms were okay. I could see that a place like this would be great for a family, or to have a space to hang out (the split level made it feel more like a home rather than a hotel room). We enjoyed it for what we needed it for - a bed to come home to at night, and a shower.The hotel is located on a side street (Jianhua Nan lu), just off the main strip of Jianguomenwai Ave. There is not a ton of stuff right around the hotel, but there is a 24 hour 7-11 store (great to buy water, snacks, etc), and Jianguomenwai gets you to all the attractions in a flash. If you are traveling alone you might want to taxi it to the hotel at night as the side street is not well lit.There was also a great cafe right around the corner - breakfast was included for hotel guests there every morning, which was quite tasty, a mix of continental and chinese fare. Also we'd go there late at night for some tea, to use their free wireless internet and listen to their great jazz music. The staff at this cafe were so friendly, and they made a mean cup of tea.I'd probably stay here again if I were on a budget. If I could splurge a few more dollars I'd probably stay elsewhere."
4,76,"Jun 20 2009 	Can be better	The 3 bedroom apartment we stayed in was great in design, we loved loft. But the large apartment was not very clean. We have to wear disposable slippers to walk around. Mineral water was only given on first day. All other hotels we stayed in during our trip gave us 2 bottles of mineral water every day every room. The toiletries are also not properly replenished. We had to use one roll of toilet paper collected from a previous hotel. But our apartment was serviced daily. Problem with the air-con remote control was speedily remedied. Front desk staff have to be trained to greet guests, many just ignore you. Bellhop, some open the door for you and greet you, but not others. Assistant manager was helpful and courteous throughout, from reserving room to checking-out. She even called to find out how we were. If only all the staff can be trained to be of her quality. It was the same with the MCS coffee around the corner, which provided breakfast for the Luxury guests. Helpful, obliging, but could do with more smiles. Food was o.k., my only worry are the occasional flies. But there are covers for the dishes. But I didn't take the jams. The security in the hotel is assuring, but the laundrette room is outside of the security door in the carpark in basement 1. A bit scary to go there, I zoom in and out as soon as I can each time. 3 washers and 2 dryers (1 more out of order) were inside the room, each machine require a bronze coin from the front desk costing RMB 20. Washing powder is provided free in the room. There is a 7-eleven in front of the hotel, very useful. YongAnLi subway station is 15 mins walk away. From there you can reach Tiananmen, forbidden city, wangfujin street, tiantan, etc. easily. Fast food, small eateries, restaurants abound in the vicinity, some just round the corner, some 15 minutes walk away. I recommend De Tai Lou (restaurant) which is 3 min walk away. Chinese food, cheap and takeaway allowed. Traffic in the vicinity can be quite heavy at times though."
5,76,"Jun 19 2009 	Central location execellent value.	We stayed here for 6 nights and found it a welcome respite after a long day sightseeing around Beijing. Rooms were roomy, clean and comfortable , breakfasts in the attached restraunt were reasonable although simple, although they offered no cereal and when asked did not know what cereal was. We used taxis extensivly and found the cost minimal from this central accomadation. Its not a 5 star hotel but for a family (5 adults) it was very good value."
6,76,"Jun 14 2009 	Great base while in Beijing	My partner and I just spent 6 nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence in a 1-bedroomed apt. We found it was a great base at very reasonable rates (We paid $56/night). Apartment:The apartment was huge - which was a nice change from some of the other micro-rooms we stayed in while travelling around China - with a lounge area, separate kitchen and bathroom downstairs; and the bedroom, desk area, second bathroom - and even a separate clothes drying room (which we made good use of) upstairs. The space is so large that there are 3 air conditioners to keep it cool. The funishings were definitely on the cheap side and a little worn, but perfectly adequate and the bed was comfortable. Apt had free internet.We found the front desk staff friendly, but not terribly knowledgable. The workout room is reasonable with a couple of running machines, universal equipment and some free weights.Location:The location is fine - the good news is that all the main tourist spots are only about a $2.00 taxi ride away. The bad news is that all the main tourist spots are a $2.00 taxi ride away!! The only thing of interest within walking distance is the Silk market. The nearest subway entance is about a 10-15 min walk (right by the Silk market).The apartment complex is hard for taxi drivers to find - it is near the base of the road on the Western side. Just keep an eye out for signs for the 7/11.Nearby Amenities:As others have mentioned there is a 7/11 less than 2 min walk, as well as a huge Western style supermarket in the SciTech plaza about a 7 minute walk away - with everything you could possible want. There is also a street of Western style restaurants on Xiushui St ( directly behind the Friendship store) popular with the large expat population in the area. Includes an American diner and an excellent Tibetan restaurant we ate at one night.Cons:The only thing that annoyed us is that machines in the laundry room require tokens (at $4.00 a pop) which you have to buy at the front desk. We bought a half dozen when we first arrived and ended up having a couple left over at the end of the week. When we went to return these to the front desk we were told that they were nonrefundable. (They gave us a weak excuse that the money had already been logged by accounting!!) - even thought the money is just stored in a small tin along with the tokens. It would have been nice if they had told us that when we bought them!!"
7,76,"Apr 4 2009 	Best Kept Secret for the Greatest Value in Beijing	We looked through Tripadvisor and found this great hotel Luxury serviced residence .We were so happy we cancelled our reservations at Marriott ! We stayed in a one bedroom unit. This comes with a living room, full kitchen, seperate bedroom in the upper level, 2 bathrooms ! cooking utensils, dishes, microwave, refrigerator etc etc ! We felt perfectly at home . This is our 4 th night ! The staff is always very friendly and helpful. They will guide you to anything ! Change money at great rates. There is a 24 hr seven eleven across. This comes with coupons for breakfast at MCS coffee. Taxis are cheap and we can get to anywhere in 10 to 20 RMB ! Dont forget to visit The Place , the new mall just 5 mins cab ride ! We wish we had such a hotel in every city we travel ! We booked through expedia and got 30 % offf for every 3 nights you book ! What a deal ! We got the 790 sq ft apartment for about $ 68 US per night with breakfast !"
8,76,"Mar 10 2009 	A spacious home away from home with facilities	I booked into the Luxury Serviced Residence on the basis of positive internet reviews and very reasonable cost. My wife and I were very happy with this quiet and spacious apartment which provided all the facilities needed to become our Beijing home for 10 days. Kitchen facilities were very good and the apartment was efficiently serviced daily. The bed was firm just like at home with an inner spring mattress on a slat base, the way we like it. Security was excellent. Desk staff had limited English but helped us wherever they could, and always with a smile. A display of tourist pamphlets would have been helpful but it seemed that in this city tourist are left to find their own way. Fortunately my extensive internet research prior to leaving Australia proved invaluable as a tourist. Neither the downstairs or upstairs ensuite had a bath but we showered comfortably. Breakfast in the downstairs cafe was cold and terrible so we used hotel vouchers wisely and didn't pay for breakfasts that were barely better than nothing. Buses (10 minutes walk) and subway (15 minutes) were regular, cheap and handy for city access although very crowded. If I return to Beijing I'll again stay at the Luxury Residence without hesitation."
9,76,"Nov 4 2008 	Outstanding value!	I cannot recommend this hotel/serviced apartment highly enough. - The front desk staff was always extremely helpful and communication was easier than you may be led to believe is likely in China. We relied heavily on the staff for translations of locations (we were in Beijing on business and thus had to travel to several locations during the course of our stay that weren't typical tourist destinations) and they were fantastic.- The apartment itself vastly exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment, and our space was set up &quot;loft style&quot; with a 2 floor layout; 2 bedrooms above and 1 on the ground floor. The apartment also had a large kitchen, huge main room, respectable Ikea-styled furnishings, and 2 bathrooms. The apartment was clean, well maintained, and even included a DVD player and sound system.- The location was outstanding. The Chaoyang district is large but contains quite a bit of commercial and nightlife/restaurant activity, so you're in the &quot;right&quot; area of the city IMO. You're also relatively close to some of the main tourist attractions (Tienaman, Forbidden City, etc.).- Considering that we paid around $150/night for 3 people, I feel this was an extremely good value. I'm a fairly well seasoned international traveler, and rarely have I been more pleasantly surprised than I was in this instance. This was a comfortable, hassle-free stay and I'd book it again in a heartbeat.- One word of advice...taxi drivers do have some difficulty finding the building. Once we'd arrived, it wasn't a problem because we had our bearings, but on your initial trip in from the airport, you should be aware that the entrance to the building is off the street...you need to go past a gate into a little courtyard/roundabout."
10,76,"Oct 21 2008 	Great Value 	We stayed here from Oct 11 to Oct 14 2008. Very well located and very well-maintained. Going back to the apartment is like going home each day.LOCATION1. Walking distance to Subway line 1 - Stations are: A. JianGuoMen Station (Line 1 &amp; Line 2) B. YongAnLi (Line 1)2. Taxis have a hard time looking for the entrance because it is very nondescript. Tell them it is near the Beijing Friendship store. Look for SPR Cafe &amp; 7-11. Remember to print the map of the hotel in MANDARIN.3. Embassy area in Chaoyang. Walking distance (15mins) to the famous Silk Market where they sell at the fake stuff.RECEPTION1. Friendly. Anticipated that that we will need toiletries (serviced apartments usually do not provide).2. Not very proficient in navigating around the tourist areas. Was unable to answer question wrt to visiting the Bird's Nest &amp; Water Cube.FOODNo breakfast provided. Hey, you are staying in a serviced apartment with stove, microwave and toaster. There is also a cafe at the same block. So you will not starve......APARTMENTThe pictures speaks for itself! While the apartment is very new (age is starting to show), it is Scandanavian-designed and very well-maintained. Well, we have a soft spot for lofts, and we simply loved it. There is a DVD player. So you can hop to the DVD shop next block, and feast on DVDs (there's not much to do in BJ at night.).OTHER FACILITIESLaunderette, Gym.WOULD WE STAY HERE AGAIN ?Absolutely. We paid less than US$100 per night for the length of stay and I would say it is absolutely worth it!! Very centralised. You can either than the subway (for 3 to 4 stops) to Wangfujing or even take a public bus f(just outside the BJ Friendship store) for RMB1. My bet is on the subway so that you can avoid the horrendous BJ traffic jams."
11,76,"Sep 29 2008 	Great apartment hotel in Embassy area!	We booked 8 nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence (An Ascott property) in Sept 08. I had read one other review on Tripadvisor which was positive but it was difficult to find other reviews.We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. The hotel is located in the embassy area which we think is terrific. When we checked in, the desk person took us to our apartment. We were impressed with this personal service and sheer enthusiasm of the tour. She was obviously proud of her hotel's apartment and services. At check in, we were invited to a free party to celebrate the Moon Festival which is a very important celebration in Chinese life. For the party, all we had to do is show up in the lobby and the hotel took care of transferring us to the hutong cafe and hosting the party. (We had a great time).The apartment is large by any standards. The first floor has a living room/ dining room area, a kitchen, and a half bathroom. The second floor has a large bedroom, desk area, and bathroom with a shower. We met several people who have lived at the Luxury Serviced Residence for years. One couple we met at the party has lived there for three years.For those who choose to cook, there is a full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, hot water pot, toaster, and dishes to match. The only thing we added was some microwavable dishes. There is a 7/11 across the circle driveway for quick snacks and sundries.There always seems to be someone who speaks English on duty. Each time we set out for the day we would stop by the desk and ask that our destination be written out in Chinese. Taxi drivers, in our experience, do not speak English and most do not read maps. There is a subway stop (Jian Guo men) about 1/4 mile away. It is an easy walk and the subway is extremely easy to use. The Bank of China is on the main cross street nearly around the corner. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who prefers an apartment."
12,76,May 19 2008 	very friendly LSR	The first week of May 2008 we stayed at LSR. The people are very friendly and helpfull. The rooms were clean. We stayed there with 2 children. (8 and 4) breakfast is at the corner of the building SPR Cofee. Across the building there is a little supermarket 24 H 7 days a week open.
1,86,They are letting the place rot	they are budget hotels and there are budget hotels. but this is the worst hotel ever. very depressing. no upkeep. shower appliances coming off the hook. stained carpets. personal unfriendly/demoralized. i think they want to get rid of the budget crowd altogether. i left after one night. do you yourself a favor and go to a better hotel nearby.
2,86,"Nov 13 2009 	unbelievably tranquil and luxurious	I just got back from Beijing yesterday and can't rave enough! I'm 20 years old and stayed in a room with my older aunt and two young cousins (both under 12) and all four of us fell in love with the plethora of chinese and western breakfast assortments (from fresh and safe fruit to buttery homestyle croissants and traditional american bacon eggs and hash browns) and tranquil and luxurious enviornment. The staff was above and beyond helpful and attentive. The bartenders in the hotel bar are not only beautiful but very funny and comforting. My favorites being Kitty, Lily, Zheng, and Melody! The hotel is right across from Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, Burberry, etc. and when it's snowing, its unbelievably magestic! We stayed for 5 days and 4 nights and found every moment in the hotel, dining room, and pool to be absolutely FABULOUS!! The hotel offers enough western tradition while never masking the Chinese culture. If I had the option to go back I would do so weekly!! Everything was very clean, and organized making relaxation while getting a massage or laying by the infinity-like pool beautiful. If you have the opportunity to visit Beijing absolutely make it a point to stay at this hotel (the new part I would recomment as I've never seen the older rooms) at least for one night. It is absolutely worth every penny!!!"
3,86,"Nov 11 2009 	Good location wonderfull breakfast!	A mistake occurred with our booking, but it was no problem, we were up-graded and we had 3 great rooms, 2 of them, suites! It was the only place we truly enjoyed in Beijing, breakfast was great, if you are a foreigner in CHINA, you need to get a good breakfast because you dont know where you might find appropriate food again! Beijing was cold but when we walked into the hotel, it felt like heaven, great service!"
4,86,"Oct 21 2009 	Great location but dated stuffy rooms	My husband and I live in China and came to Beijing with his parents who are visiting from Canada. We arranged a private tour with CITS and were booked at the Novotel Beijing Peace. You could not ask for a better location, walking distance to the Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Night Market (snack street) and if you are a shopper, Louis Vuitton and Burberry are just a stones throw away. The lobby was large and grand and looks like what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. After a reasonably quick check in, we headed to our rooms on the 15th floor, our room was a fairly large corner room with a spectacular view but this is where the stars started to fad! The room was very dated with bad carpet, an uncomfortable and well used love seat and a brass and glass table straight from the 80's. The bathroom was disgusting!!! The toilet seat was so old that it had yellowed and the fixtures were ancient and decrepit. To top it off the rooms were stuffy and hot and the windows did not open. In our room there was no A/C but we were able to turn a fan on to get some of the air moving but my in laws were not so lucky. My husband then went down to the front desk to complain about the air conditioning and to get different room for his parents and was told that the hotel was booked and there were no other rooms available. They also told him that no rooms in the hotel had A/C at this time of year and that it was like that in all hotels in Beijing!!! Please, this is not our first trip to Beijing and we have stayed in countless hotels during all seasons, don't give us that crap! After some negotiating the in laws were moved to a new room - better but still no A/C and the room stank of smoke even though we were on a non smoking floor. The next morning we headed down for a delicious buffet breakfast which was included in our stay. The food was very good for a buffet and the selection was abundant. The hostess that brought us to our seats was friendly enough as were the many chefs and cooks but the waiting staff were in need of some serious customer service training. We were half finished our breakfast before we were able to get someone to bring us some coffee and even then it seemed like we were bothering her. It looked like none of the waiting staff were happy to be there, moving slowly and never smiling.I would also like to say that the cost of the internet in the room is outrageous at 150 RMB for 24 hours (although this is not exclusive of this hotel).Anyways, long story short - I will not be staying at this hotel in the future and I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,86,"Oct 18 2009 	Superb location / comfortable accomodations / great breakfast	I'm a fan of Novotel and found this location to fully meet my expectations. Clean, comfortable, quite room with an excellent breakfast buffet. Concierge helpful with navigating to destinations in the city. Only negative was the consistently grumpy breakfast buffet employees who served up food and coffee with a grimace."
6,86,"Oct 14 2009 	almost 4 points but what a shame the service is so bad and the lobby just disguting...	I'm staying often in this hotel for business and if a few years ago, this property was extremly bad with disguting rooms, the refurnishment of the rooms has been really well done and in regard to the value, Novotel Peace is now a good deal in Beijing and a quite good choice...OK, if we focus on the service, it's still very average with a staff not good at all in english and not very smily. You have always the impression to disturb them when you need something. The staff at the reception could try to think why they have decided to work in the hospitality industry cause it's hard to see... Same at the restaurant for the buffet breakfast, don't even expect any smile or any &quot;good morning&quot; and don't forget the hot drinks are in self service cause if you ask them, it could make them unhappy...About the concierge, if you need any &quot;tip&quot; about the city or a restaurant, i highly recommend you to refer to your &quot;Lonely Planet&quot;Anyway, you understand you will do not choose this hotel for the quality of service but more probably for the location just in the middle of the city at 20 minutes walk from the Forbidden City and easy access for shopping and sightseeing; for a very good value cause the rooms have been renovated and spend a bit more to stay at the Executive level cause if the bathrooms are a bit dated in the standard and deluxe rooms, the ones of the Executive rooms are brand new with a large shower very comfy; for a good design of the rooms, modern and zen, different from what you expect to find in a Novotel; for the very acceptable size of the rooms making a stay with a third person absolutely possible and for the buffet breakfast offering a good and yummy selection of sweet and salted dishes (crpes are really good and friend veggies so delicious...).However, if the rooms are nicely decorated, the lobby is still not renovated and looks like from an other century often with an ugly flower arrangement and with dirty and very old sofas in the lounge. I hope the management is thinking about re-designing the lobby cause this is the first impression the guests have when checking...But due to the excellent rooms and this incredible value for money, this property is close to 4 points but a lot of things have to be improved and for now, let's just say this hotel is recommandable but nothing amazing..."
7,86,"Oct 10 2009 	Great location	Stayed here for a couple of nights before attending a conference just out of Beijing. The Novotel is well located, close to the big ticket sights. The hotel met the standards that you would expect of its chain. The buffet dinner was relatively expensive by Beijing standards, and there were probably more affordable &quot;Chinese cuisine&quot; options within walking distance."
8,86,"Oct 9 2009	Comfortable base in Beijing	We stayed at the Novotel Peace for three nights, this being the first leg of our seven city tour of China.After passing through strict swine flu checks at Beijing Airport we arrived late morning at the hotel.The hotel has a large, impressive lobby with a wide staircase at its centre. At the time of our visit, a huge mooncake was displayed on a table in the centre of the lobby.Having stayed at several Novotels in the UK, this was in a completely different league. The room was large, with two double beds and floor to ceiling windows offering views along the busy road running outside of the hotel and over the rooftops of Beijing.The bathroom was a little tired but was perfectly adequate.There is a separate room for Internet use, but two free computers were available on a 'first come first served' basis in the lobby area towards the lifts, however these were almost always in use.Breakfast was included in the price and was varied, catering for all nationalities. The lobby bar was expensive but was quite comfortable and relaxing after a hard day's sightseeing.We ate in The Square restaurant, also on the ground floor, on the last night, where we had a tasty Nasi Goreng and Club Sandwich.As mentioned by most reviewers, the situation of the Novotel is perfect. Ten minutes walk to Wanfujing Street and the evening food street, serving such exotics as Sheep's Testicles and Sheep's Penis!The hotel organised a taxi one evening to take us to the Houhai Bar and restaurant area and wrote on a pad the Chinese name for the Novotel which we had to present to the taxi driver for our return trip as they would never have understood us otherwise.I would recommend the Novotel to anyone visiting Beijing. In addition to the obvious sights such as Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Hutongs and the Great Wall, do make the effort to visit the Temple of Heaven in the south of the city. If you get there early you will be entertained by hundreds of locals singing, ballroom dancing, playing musical instruments and practising tai-chi - an definite highlight of a Beijing trip."
9,86,"Oct 1 2009 	A bit of a disappointment	If you're searching for an affordable hotel within walking distance to the heart of the city, Novotel Peace is not a bad choice for the price BUT don't expect much. The lobby is deceivingly well-furbished but as soon as you're shown to your room, you'd be a little disappointed. The first three days were were in a twin room. It was a pretty good sized room but it was oddly shaped, facing the backstreet, and worst of all, there must have been some plumbing problems because part of the carpet was wet all the time. We didn't complain because we were barely in our room, but on our 3rd day, half the room was soaked! We received a note from the reception saying that they would like to reassign us to an &quot;upgraded&quot; room on the 12th floor. They should have done this a long time ago but we should also have complained. It was a nuisance packing our stuff and moving on our last evening knowing that we'd have to re-pack the next day. The &quot;upgraded room&quot; was a twin-Queen room with a nice view of the surroundings but there was mould living in the bathroom and its condition was worst that our first room.Besides our rooms, the facilities and service is a meager &quot;ok&quot;. The swimming pool cannot accommodate more than two serious swimmers, breakfast (if not included with the price of the room) is pretty expensive for Beijing standards (15 Euros per person) and although the variety of food is great, you'd get a better deal at local restaurants. Service? There wasn't quite much besides organized tours which was overpriced. My mom and I paid 600 RMB for a driver to take us to the Great Wall and the Ming Courts. We sorta regretted later as the driver was always rushing us. We decided to go for this option in the first place to AVOID the hectic of tours. One word of advise: take a whole day for the Summer Place. It's worth it and you can get there easily by taxi. Check out the option of taking a ferry from the zoo.My mom and I decided that we would split up our week's stay in Beijing first staying at a traditional Hutong courtyard hotel 15 minutes from the city center and then move to a more conventional hotel for the swimming pool and travel convenience. All our knowledge about Beijing stemmed from travel guides and internet sites so we didn't really know the layout of the city. Although Novotel Peace is really close to the Forbidden City (20 minutes walk) and to the shopping district of Wangfujing (5 minutes walk), our Hutong (Ji House Courtyard Hotel: www.jihousecn.com), situated close to Gulou was a much better place to stay in terms of sight seeing and nightlife. It gave us a more authentic feel for Beijing, whereas Wangfujing area is over-priced, over-westernized, and not too exciting. However, the second day of our stay at Novotel, we discovered lots of small, wonderful local boutiques behind the hotel great for shopping. Verdict: I'd will most likely try another hotel next time. If the price is right (we paid 50 Euros per night which was really cheap), and if you don't plan to spend too much time at the hotel, sure, it's not too bad of an option."
10,86,"Sep 29 2009 	Unbelievable service and value!	We had a fantastic stay at the Novotel Peace. Great location, very close to Wangfujing shopping and the snack street. Walking distance to Forbidden City and Tiananmen. The room was very clean and comfy, with nice furnishings. And finally, the concierges were beyond fantastic. Friendly, courteous, went above and beyond in making sure that our taxi drivers knew exactly where we were going (and we went to some unusual places). They also can quickly and easily arrange a car to the Wall or other popular spots for a fairly standard price. Really a great place; would recommend to anyone. One note: paid internet in the room, but free wifi in lobby and also two computers in lobby for general quick use."
11,86,"Sep 26 2009 	LOCATION AND...LOCATION	We booked this hotel after reading the somewhat positive comments on this site, and locating it on a map....Well, we did found the location to be near perfect....The hotel is facing the Peninsula (wich has a Bank of China international ATM in its basement floor), Lee's Garden Hotel,etc...I did felt a ''western'' athmosphere in this aera, wich is not bad...it kinda allows you to digest more easily the somethimes-intense sightseeing during the day...There's an entire trendy shopping aera minutes away, with a fantastic shopping center at about 10 min walking from the hotel, with numerous and great restaurants;ranging from Pizza Hut to South Silk Road (wich I highly recommend)...The Forbidden City is at about 15-20 minutes walk, (for the north gate, if not mistaking), but would suggest to take a cab (about 10RMB), and keep your energy for inside the city, since theres already a lot of walking and standing still inside the city)...The temple of Heaven is a couple of minutes away by cab from the hotel, etc...Theres a very nice tea shop just next to hotel (can't miss the waterfall-tea pot outside)...We did avoid it at first since we where afraid to get scammed there, but actually, after comparing it to Xi An tea shops, the prices are very reasonable...When we first checked-in, they located us in the west-wing. First thing we noticed is the ridiculeous walking distance from the lobby to the room, and the awfull looking carpet waiting for you in the 4th floor hall....It looks like all the toilets from the floor rooms have leaked and spoiled the carpet...all the way...But the rooms where renovated, and had quite a lot of storage facilities...The bathroom was nice, with a separated glass-shower unit. After our trip from Xi An, they relocated us in the east-wing, in a corner room, and the room, although a bit aged, was huge, with a nice corner wall-window, etc...The breakfast brunch is ridiculeously overpriced, the internet is free if don't mind standing up and having some people waiting from you in your back, and reading your e-mails with you (only 2 screens) . If you want tu use it the business office, it costs about 3RMB/minute for internet...But the worst was probably the service....I wasnt expecting an unforgettable consumer service in China (no offence), but since this hotel is proudly french-owned, they should seriously thinking about teaching the staff to be more friendlier....But I guess that tall-french dude who seems to be the manager there is more busy talking about China's car-prices with the bell-boys than talking care of business...All in all, its really the location that makes it a great deal for us, since the rest is kinda forgettable..."
12,86,"Sep 20 2009 	Location can't be beat great value here	The location is perfect for Beijing, just 3 minutes walk to Wanfujing shopping street. Not too far to the subway, I think about a 10 minute walk. The food in the buffet restaurant was really excellent, and a great value for money. I went to other Beijing buffets, most were much more expensive and not have as good or generous as here. The room was fine, about 3.5 to 4 stars, everything worked great, especially the air conditioning. There is an older and newer tower, the newer seems a bit nicer and more recently refurbished. Compared to other Beijing hotels, this is an outstanding value for money."
13,86,"Sep 16 2009 	Value for Money - Great Location and Service!	I stayed in Novotel with my partner for 5 days in Beijing. We managed to get a good deal online for only USD65 per night. Location was good, just a stone throw from WangfuJing, although it is about 8mins walk to the nearest MRT station, it was ok. Room was rather small but good. Good housekeeping service and free WiFi in the room and internet at the lobby. Clean sheets and hot water!Only grasp is the bed is hard. Don't be surprised to wake up to shoulder ache for the first 10mins in the morning. Also, breakfast is USD 17 per pax which is ridiculously expensive! But there is a nearby shopping centre which has Mac 24hrs and eatery that opens at 8am.. and at another corner, a breadshop that opens at 6am so no worries there!Stay here if you are fine with a run in a mill hotel, with good location."
14,86,"Sep 5 2009 	Affordable luxury in the heart of Beijing	I was impressed the minute I walked in the lobby. We were immediately greeted by a bellhop who took our bags. My daughter and I arrived at midnight and were told that my son who had arrived at 9:00 a.m. had checked in at that time. I assumed he would have had to wait until the afternoon to get into a room. My request for an extra blanket was immediately met. The room was very clean. The concierge was always very helpful. When he made reservations for us to see an acrobatic show we arrived expecting to be shown to the cheap seats that we paid for, but we were taken the center of the front row. The free buffet breakfast was great. The only thing I disliked was the smoking in the lobby and bar. Unfortunately that seems to be the norm anywhere in China."
15,86,"Sep 4 2009 	Great location usual Novotel style rooms	I got put up here on a business trip to Beijing, I didnt have any choice of the hotel. After my business trip I spent 2 weeks travelling round China and when I returned to Beijing I chose the Emperor hotel, which is worth checking out, a little pricier, but fantastic.I thought the hotel was fine as a business hotel, I spent a very happy week here. The location is great and when I had a little time to myself I was able to quite happily see many parts of the city on foot. The breakfast at the hotel is of a good standard and has a wonderful array of choice from Western and Eastern selections.The rooms are typical Novotel style, if you have stayed at a Novotel or similar standard chain hotel before you will know what to expect.The taxi hailing staff outside are fabulous, they ran around outside hailing taxis for me at all times of the day and night, in the rain, everything. Big thank-you to them. A good pick I think if it suits your budget - enjoy Beijing!"
16,86,Aug 26 2009 	Perfect location for touring the Forbidden City	We stayed on the Club level and the room and the service were very nice. We had a king room with a comfortable couch that was big enough for our adult son to sleep on. They did not charge for the third person. We enjoyed a view of the Forbidden City from our room. The Club level includes an elaborate breakfast buffet and happy hour with free drinks and hor d'oeuvres. The only negative was that the bed was a Chinese bed and very hard.
17,86,Aug 25 2009 	not so nice hotel and not a nice staff	This hotel was a bad experience. I am a A club goldmember that is a card where you get some extra's. You can get a free upgrade when the hotel is no full and also you can get late check out. With the booking i asked the hotel to give me a upgrade from the superior room to the excutive room. When we checked in the staff did not know anything about the request of our upgrade. There came a lady to help and she told me that next time that i want mine upgrade i need to call the hotel. But in the reservation form of the hotel you can put a text for the hotel. She sad to me that she will give us a upgrade because the hotel was half full.The upgrade was nothing just a bigger superiorroom and not what the website of the hotel told us a room with free internet and a apple dockingstation.They also made a mistake with the internetconection. You can by internet for 24 hours we did that for 3 days. When we want to settle the bill they charged us 4 days of internet. When we explained to the reception that there was a mistake the girl did not want to listen because she did not understand us. After 20 minutes complaining and explaining she charged us 3 days. But she still did not understand us.The rooms are not very nice and very old the really need to upgrade the rooms.The breakfast was a real party a great buffet with a lot of choice.I will never stay again in Novotel Peace Beijing because of the service the don't give.
18,86,Aug 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel central location nice pool	Amazing foyer!. Room spacious and very clean. Swimming pool on second floor very pleasant with large changing rooms and small gym. Breakfast buffet excellent choice of european and asian cuisine. Dodgy coffee machine though!Great location for walking to Forbidden City and Tianamen Square. Wear comfortable shoes and buy some water from the shops along the way. Takes about 20 mins to get there. Lots of restaurants to choose from too. Main shopping area Wanfujing is not far from the hotel. Very pretty at night lit up. Supermarket across the road (and down a side street )from the hotel sells drinks and snacks cheaply.
19,86,Aug 7 2009 	Great location	Overall our 5 day stay was great. The staff is friendly but service is not upto the mark. My coffee sachet in the room was not replaced after the first one. House keeping should have seen to it. I used the coffee from the kid's room.The location of the hotel is the best. Close to shopping and restaurants. I would go back and stay there again.
20,86,"Aug 3 2009 	Decent central hotel - good option for small families and others	We spent 5 nights at the Novotel in mid-July -a large, bland, good-quality, reasonably priced Western chain hotel located in central Beijing. We opted for an executive room (somewhat more expensive but assures you of a better quality room) - all was fine with it. - Views - We were on a top floor and did not have a view over the Forbidden City - apparently there are very few rooms with good views in that direction.- Cost - We checked out the main discount websites and were able to get a much better deal directly from the Novotel - about 20% off the regular sale rates, but for a non-changeable non reimbursable reservation. We had to become members of the Novotel/Ibis/Sofitel &quot;frequent users&quot; group - free and easy to do over the web - to access the lowest prices though.- Families with teens - A huge advantage of the Novotel is that kids (at least 1, probably 2) stay free in rooms up to age 16, unlike the 12 year cut-off of most hotels. That lowered our costs a good deal, and makes the Novotel an especially good option for small families.- Location - in central Beijing, near a subway stop, near huge shopping malls and a shopping street, a long walk or short taxi ride from the Forbidden City, etc. We went to the acrobat show one night and had trouble finding a taxi afterwards - ended up taking the metro back (a stop was right beside the theater) and got home faster and at 5% the cost in the end. FYI - subways (metros) are easy to use, with announcements in English as well as in Chinese. There are plenty of ATMs in the area (across the street and in the nearby Peninsula Hotel). Too, there is a good nearby food shop - turn right as you leave the hotel, then take the first left;- it is maybe 40 meters down that road - good for getting snacks and reasonably priced bottled water, etc.- Our room was in excellent shape. Yes, the hotel is not brand new but our room was kept in very good condition, strong water pressure for showers, safe included, a sitting area with two small sofas and a coffee table, a flat-screened TV, etc. - Pool - small but fine, about impossible for people to do laps and have kids in the pool at the same time.- The front desk and concierge desk staff were fine - well-informed and pleasant. We went to a less travelled part of the Great Wall and were able to get a good English-speaking driver for the day for 600 yuan in a comfortable car. (You can negotiate a regular taxi down to about 400 yuan, but forget about English, comfort, and a fair number of Beijing taxi drivers are formula 1 wannabees...- Internet - there are two recent apple computers in the front lobby for guests to use for free - quick access to websites. I think (not sure) that wifi is also available for those with their own laptops.- Breakfast - The Novotel breakfast buffet is both excellent and overpriced (around 22 USD per person), so we ate there once. It is too bad that they don't offer a lower-priced continental breakfast for people not travelling on an expense account... We never found a good substitute breakfast restaurant in the area - places to eat at the nearby mall and shopping street open up too late, etc. Twice we bought pastries at a nearby store and milk, Nescafe and yogurt at another, and ate in our room. Would we return? Yes, but without a lot of enthusiasm as, again, the hotel is bland but fine. It is a good option for small families on a budget and for business travelers. We would have preferred going to a more typical Chinese hotel in a Hutong but, in the end, are glad we did not - taxis are loathe to enter into those areas (roads are very narrow), most do not know of the smaller Hutong hotels and, for a first trip to China, being in a large western chain with an English-speaking staff and easy to access made it worth it..."
21,86,Aug 1 2009 	Initially disappointing got better	Arrived late at 11.00 pm. Although we have booked and paid for in advance by many months and advised them we were going to arrive late they hadn't pre-allocated us our requested rooms - two adjoining rooms as we were a family of five in the main block preferably higher up with a view towards the Forbidden City ( I had read other Trip Advisor reviews to ask for this.) . Instead they gave us two old rooms on different floors in the adjoining tower - room numbers start with 2 if you are at reception and they try to give you one of these rooms. They said they were fully booked that night and that there was no other option - letting us inspect the rooms to see if they are suitable. After a 20 hour flight what could we do - say they weren't suitable and go to another hotel ??? remember we had pre-paid. Anyway they promised to move us the next day. In the adjoining block the carpets were very water stained and smelt musty - the hallways had low ceilings and the rooms looked like they hadn't changed since the 1960's. The beds very very very hard - so it was better to lie on your back to try and spread the pressure of your body over the mattress rather lie on your side and know where all the pressure points are. Anyway they did move us the next day to the main block to Level 10. We did have a distant view to the Forbidden City and to the back of the Novotel where they was still a cluster of Hutongs. The beds were much better here. Rooms were spacious and about average - we have been to better Novotels in other countries. There is free wireless internet at the lobby bar - room internet is exhorbitantly priced and although they had two free Macs in the lobby one was down and the other one was lways being used. Breakfast was nice although a bit pricey. Cheaper good food at the mall 5 minutes walk down to Wafujing St on the 6th floor. Bottled water in the rooms a rif off considering you could get it for 1.4 RMB from the local convinience store - why pay 60 RMB in the room. Stayed 11 nights - great central location - walked the second day to the Forbidden City - would have been better to take the taxi as it was 35 degrees Celcius!
22,86,"Jul 20 2009 	Alot to learn about guest expectations	Outstanding location, poor service. A weekend treat away from Bangkok to Beijing where the worst service we had all weekend was on the executive floor of this hotel. Staff are surely poorly trained if they cannot offer you a glass of water in the lounge rather than give you a lecture on how they will charge you for a bottle of water instead. Thankfully all the other places and service we encountered in Beijing contradicted this poor impression."
23,86,"Jul 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel in Beijing	Excellent location, close to wan fujing shopping street with famous and oldest Roastduck restaurant. The staff were bar staff were friendly. Very impressed with this hotel."
24,86,"Jun 26 2009 	Good city hotel	When we arrived we were able to check in straight away, even though it was only 8am. It meant that we had a twin room rather than a king, but it was so good to be able to get some sleep, and it set us up for the rest of the day. The room was very pleasant, and certainly not shabby, as some people have mentioned.The location is good, minutes from the main shopping area, and walking distance to the Forbidden City, about 20/30 minutes I should think. We always got distracted by the shops, which is why I'm not sure how long it took.The pool was nice, although the footbath on the way into the pool looked dirty, and you couldn't avoid it. The pool was small, but as we were still on English time(sort of) we were having a swim as it opened at 6am, and had the pool to ourselves.The breakfast was good with a lot of options, and everything was very fresh.Internet in reception was very useful, the only hotel on our holiday that provided this service. Changed money in the lobby a couple of times, and they were very helpful, letting me have a mixture of large and small notes. Mini-bar, like most hotels, stupid prices - 60 yuan for a bottle of water, surely they would make more money if they charged less, as more people would use it?Overall, good hotel, in an excellent location."
25,86,"Jun 26 2009 	A very good location if slightly worn looking appearance inside this hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, I had chosen the Peace Hotel as it seemed very central and I was going to be doing some hardcore sightseeing whilst in Beijing.Arriving late after a flight from Kazakhstan, I jumped in a taxi at Beijing airport and after some initial confusion discovered that the locals recognise this hotel as 'Peace Hotel' and don't understand the Novotel part of the name.A huge lobby awaits, that includes 2 huge I-Mac's for free surfing, check-in was fairly quick. The layout of the hotel was quite strange and my room was in a wing that meant I had to go up one floor then walk around the top of the lobby before getting a lift to the floor I was staying on. The room itself was standard Novotel fare, although the large flat screen TV was a nice touch.The location is very good, and has a choice of 2 metro stops within a few minutes walking distance. It's also located less than a minute walk from Wangfujing St which is the main Shopping St in Beijing.It's quite possible to walk to Tianenman Square/Forbidden City, as I did on several occasions, and this will take between 10-15 minutes (depending on how hot it is!!)Overall this hotel was a great location, although the interior could do with a little bit of TLC. On my floor the hallway carpet was showing signs of an air-con water leak but the manager told me it is due to be replaced soon."
26,86,Jun 23 2009 	Reasonable Hotel great location	The hotel was good. It was within walking distance to the Forbidden City and the shopping district. There was a subway station within 5 minute walk which meant you can get around Beijing without much problems. Downsides - the bed in my room was unyielding hard and could not get a strong wireless signal for internet access which was supposed to be free. Staff were generally very helpful.  I would stay there again.
27,86,"Jun 5 2009 	Location is important in Beijing - Novotel Peace has got it	- Number one is that the hotel is just off Wangfujing St. and its shopping, eating and crowds, and close (10-15min walk) to Tiannamen and Forbidden City. Beijing is a BIG sprawling city and so location is very important.- The hotel itself has two sides.. The lobby looks modern and there is free Internet via courtesy iMacs in the lobby. However, the rooms are old and quite shabby. The mattresses were hard and not in a good way. Its an older hotel that they have tried to spruce up with so so renovations to the rooms.- I think the location makes up for this hotel and I would ignore the rooms but I've noted this to be fair. For Beijing this is a well priced (expedia for us) hotel with a great location."
28,86,"Jun 3 2009 	Holiday Get Away	Whilst living in central China, I took my family to visit Beijing and selected the Novotel Peace hotel for our weekend stay.As with all the Novotels, in China where I have stayed, the staff were excellent and the hotel gave great value for money."
29,86,"May 26 2009 	A very pleasant stay...	We stayed for 4 nights on 15-19 May (room 1106 and 1108) and would say it was a pleasant stay at the hotel. Upon arrival, we were given suite rooms but we didn't like the idea of walking to the other wing of the hotel when we were brought to the rooms. So the reception staff was very helpful to make changes to give us executive rooms instead. Though we wished the rooms were on higher floor and non-smoking, we believed the staff had tried their best to accommodate to our request. Anyway, it was already very nice of the hotel to give us complimentary upgrade to executive rooms. Room 1106 had strong smell of smoke when we entered the room, but the housekeeping staff on duty were very helpful too, they sprayed air refresher and it helped to get rid of the smoke smell.  The concierge staff, Mr Stephen Mao, was commendable. He spoke very fluent English and helped us identify the tourist attractions which we should visit in Beijing. He also helped us to arrange for an English-speaking taxi driver to bring us to the Great Wall (Mutianyu). The free internet access at the lobby allowed us to check our e-mails and be connected with our loved ones back home. Excellent! On the whole, we enjoyed our stay at your hotel and will look forward to staying there again."
30,86,"May 25 2009 	Great for location but the room was average.	When we arrived at this hotel we thought it looked really nice, certainly the lobby and restaurant areas are. However, our room looked 'very tired'. We also found the bed very hard, it was like sleeping on the floor. In fact I even checked under the sheet to see whether there was in fact some board there as it felt like it. However, the shower in the bathroom was great with an extra large head as well as another than you can use freehand.The wing that we stayed in had a funny smell - kind of musty but I'm not sure that it was that or something else.The location was excellent, only five minutes walk from the main shopping street in Beijing. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included in our rate and we did enjoy the selection. We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel though.There are two computers in the lobby that provide free internet but these were often in use and the internet in room is expensive."
31,86,"May 25 2009 	Great location with the style and comfort of a European hotel. All for a good value.	I couldn't beat the value for the location. I could see the Forbidden City from my window and could easily walk to Wafujing shopping district. The rooms and lobby were nice and it was a comfortable place to be as an American on his first trip to China. The staff was very nice, but there were some service oddities that I'm not sure were their fault. The line to exchange money was often 20 minutes, it was nearly impossible to hail a cab in the evening, and they nagged me about not having enough &quot;deposit&quot; even though I had given them my credit card to be charged for meals, incidentals, etc. Three criticisms: While the breakfast buffet was great, with Chinese, European and American options, it was a pricey lone option at the hotel. The Internet was free only in the highest level of rooms and in the lobby. It was $20/day in the two lower grade rooms. Oh, and the massage services were, um, less than professional.All in all, I'd stay here again easily."
32,86,"May 13 2009 	Extremely overpriced poor value with amateur/rude staff in good location	The Novotel's accommodations were the least impressive and most expensive of my 7city-3week China trip. Beijing was the last city I was visiting so I thought I would splurge on hotels and end on a high note but it fell flat. I booked an executive King room and was shocked to see that the room was extremely substandard, unimpressive, small and looked to have been decorated 25 years ago. The staff was lazy and generally unhelpful. The porter/doorman who stands outside refused to help us get a cab on a few occasions so he could smoke and talk to his buddies. Whenever you asked an employee something that involved them doing something they pretended they didn't speak english but then you would hear them speak fluent english 5 minutes later. They told the cab, after supposedly double-checking, to drop us off at the wrong area of the airport which is a HUGE problem at the Beijing airport since the terminals are so far away from each other it might as well be another airport. The thing that made me the most offended though was the restaurant/buffet. The price was absolutely ridiculous. It was so outrageous I went to look to see what they were serving, maybe I was missing out on something? Lobster and Caviar covered in gold leaf? After telling them I might be interested in eating there and wanted to see what they offer, the staff followed about a foot behind me and treated me like a criminal about to stuff food in my pocket and run out the back door. Lastly, let me mention that the hotel knew that I was just married and on my honeymoon and they did absolutely nothing to make my stay there special. Not even a congratulations. The hotel is extremely overpriced for the quality of rooms and service. I travel all over asia and this hotel cost 2 to 3 times as much as others in major cities like HK, Shanghai, etc. that were far superior in every way."
33,86,"May 13 2009 	Nice situated	I spent there 4 nights, the hotel is quite good and I suppose the price is reasonable. Wireless in restaurant for free.The breakfast you can get for extra ca 150RMB...The hotel is in very center of city, close to the Forbiden City. The shoppes are more expensive there."
34,86,"May 8 2009 	A pleasant stay	First of all, I arrived mid-afternoon from Shanghai and was surprised that at 4.30pm the room wasn't ready. I then found out that the internet in the room wasn't complimentary. I brought it to their attention that when I made the booking through Expedia.co.uk that they had phoned the hotel to check and that the hotel confirmed it was so. The receptionist, reluctantly agreed to honour this promise. I was offered a drink and asked to wait till the room was ready. They had no King size beds available and I was put in a room with 2 queen beds even though I was down for an executive room 1 bed. By the way, the queen beds looked like large singles.Nevertheless, the room was comfortable and spacious and there was a comfortable sofa to sit on. Nice floor to ceiling windows which were in need of a clean, though. I missed the bathroom I had in Shanghai and the wonderful shower at The Bund Riverside. The phone in my room was turned off which I only discovered on the last day when I asked for an early morning call and the bell boy had to come upstairs and knock on the door as I wasn't answering. Fair dues, not their fault, previous tenants must have switched it off. I chose not to eat breakfast there as it wasn't included. The man at the tour desk was very helpful and I chose to book a tour on a small bus with a small group to the Great Wall and Ming tombs which was fine.On the whole, aside from the early hiccups, it was a pleasant stay. But the moment you step out of the building be prepared to have to deal with all the soliciting and massage offers. You get used to it after a while. :)"
35,86,"Apr 27 2009 	Could be better	During our stay in Beijing, we stayed in both the Novotel Peace and Novotel Xin Qiao. To be honest, I enjoyed the Xin Qiao better. The Peace building seemed to have older rooms. Until we got our upgrade to the premium floor (which is what we were supposed to have in the first place) it wasn't great. Luckily it was only one night... but I felt the regular rooms were dirty and during the night, the ventilation kept making a high pitch sound, I thought it was something in the halls but it wasn't. Breakfast at the Square near the lobby was a lot better than breakfast in the premium lounge. Way more selection, and fresher food, however, it isn't worth whatever they charge, about 125RMB or so. All in all, if you can afford it, stay in the premium suites. Cleaner, newer, free breakfast, and Happy Hour, which was great... free drinks and snacks between 6pm and 8pm. As an aside, the subway is about a 5 minute walk... not far but when compared to the Novotel Xin Qiao, Xin Qiao is steps away from the subway. If I had to choose, I would go Xin Qiao over Peace."
36,86,"Apr 25 2009 	Nice hotel in good locations	We were very happy with this hotel - not only because it had a great location but also because the rate we got as Accor Advantage members during their 3 day sales was crazy - AUD$75.00/night. The hotel was a 5 min walking to the main shopping strip of Beijing and a 5min taxi ride to the Forbidden CIty and Tia'namen Square. When we arrived, we requested a non smoking room and because there were none left we were upgraded to a suite. It was nice enough but was situated in an old part of the hotel quite a way away from reception. It was very large but a bit old and tired compared to the other part of the hotel. The buffet breakfast was fantastic - lovely food and the huge lobby had a great bar area that you could sit and watch all the comings and goings of the hotel. They also have free internet on 2 terminals near reception - a good deal. Staff were always helpful and attentive."
37,86,"Apr 24 2009 	Great Location	This hotel has everything that you could want. The staff are helpful, the rooms are comfortable, the breakfast buffet is enormous and the room service is efficient.You can book your tours at the travel desk, I would recommend that you hire a hotel car to visit the Great Wall. The cost is 600 RMB for the whole day and you can tag on a few detours that are on route.If you don't have breakfast included in your room package then it can be very expensive (15 per person), in the shopping Mall across the road in the lower ground floor you can find a nice chinese restaurant which serves a full breakfast for around 3, they also serve great Dim Sum.Free internet in the lobby and if you are in a Club room you have internet in your room and also in the club lounge. It is worth paying he extra for a club room as you get your drinks free of charge in the evening and light snacks. The hotel bar is extremely expensive and two drinks and two small snacks came to 24 - you don't want to spend too many evenings relaxing in the bar. If you are looking for a supermarket then there is one just across the road heading towards the Hilton hotels. The shops in the hotel are very expensive and charge 10x the cost of anything you can buy outside. For clothes shoping go to Ya Show, 5 floors of fake designer goods, i-phones to Gucci hand bags. Bargain hard, things sell for 10% of the original asking price, walk away if they don't come down to your price. My daughters spent a small fortune on clothes all of it reasonabley good quality - make sure you have room in your suitaces."
38,86,"Apr 22 2009 	Great location and price	We stayed at this hotel last week for 5 nights. The hotel service was very good. Upon checking in we were given a smaller room, that didn't match the description of what we had talked about with the reservation department. We immediately went down stairs explained that we were in the wrong room, they changed our room and moved the bags immediately. The standard rooms are very small and I would not recommend them for a couple. Our room was on the 18th floor overlooking street, we enjoyed breakfast everyday on the 19th floor. It opened at 6:30am. The conceirge and front desk were helpful in providing directions, getting cabs, making dinner reservations, etc.... Everything you would expect in a big city."
39,86,"Apr 21 2009 	Great Location	Novotel Peace is an ideal place for a traveler who want to catch up with beijing after finishing his business. Located at the center of a very active shopping areas of Beijing. Also located nearby is the Food street which is bustling with local food in the evening. You get things like dog meat, fried scorpions, silk worm, snakes etc . Priced at a reasonable approx. 700 rmb per night inclusive of breakfast. Novotel peace is nothing fancy and down to business with its features and service."
40,86,Apr 14 2009 	Great value location and service	This hotel is within walking distance of the Forbidden City and a great shopping district. Pay the extra and stay on the club level floor- it has a wonderful buffet breakfast- probably the best I have had in China. Only complaint is super hard beds. I really like a hard bed but this was like sleeping on the floor with a only a sheet underneath. Most hotels have too soft beds- this is the first one with too hard.
41,86,"Apr 14 2009 	Good location	Great location within walking distance from the forbidden city (a reasonable walk) and within close distance to the night food market (great for eating scorpions) reasonable rooms (old wing could do with some work), staff were attentive enough although their concierge weren't too suggestive. When i asked for a good Chinese restaurant outside of the hotel, he suggested the place next door. Not so good. Breakfast was excellent and almost worth the stay. Fresh ingredients!!Overall a good hotel."
42,86,"Apr 12 2009 	Perfect well located hotel	Stayed at the Novotel Peace for three nights from April 2 - 5. Clean, well-appointed, and convenient for central Beijing. For business purposes it was perfect as a well-known hotel as well as its walking distance from everything. Even Tianenmen Square and the Forbidden City are easily walkable from here is you are in good shape.Fantastic breakfast buffet! The flight crews of Air France stay here so great croissants and baguette can be had! I highly recommend this hotel for any type of travel."
43,86,"Mar 28 2009 	Excellent Value Service and Location	The staff was multilingual which was extremely helpful especially while navigating through a foreign country. While the hotel didn't have the same grandeur as the other larger hotels, it was still very pleasant. The room was a little cozy and the bed a on the firm side. As far as value, location, and service, this hotel can't be beat."
44,86,"Mar 9 2009 	Western-friendly for business and tourism	We stayed for 3 nights at the Novotel. Compared to US business hotels, the Novotel is similar in style to a nicer Hilton, Westin, Marriott, or similar &quot;brand-name&quot; hotel. (Novotel is NOT a recognized brand in the US.) Most of the staff was competent enough in English to make us languange-impaired Americans feel at ease. Location was within walking distance to a shopping mall and to some other restaurants and shops. I believe it was just outside Beijing's 2nd circle, so it was reasonably close to The Forbidden City and nearby attractions. The hotel lobby was impressive and comfortable for an afternoon libation. And the breakfast buffet was marvelous. I would see this as a great hotel for the business traveller, and a comfortable and familiar hotel for the tourist."
45,86,"Feb 12 2009 	Appreciated the spacious room with its full-length window 'wall'	I took advantage of a very good rate, about US$70 per night, to stay at this four-star hotel that I would otherwise not have splurged on at &quot;normal&quot; rates of $150+. The room I got was a double with a good view. Bathroom was well-equipped, with hot water at all times. Everything worked, and there was no damage evident anywhere in the room. It must've been recently renovated. Most of all, I loved the full-length windows that opened out onto the street, and the ample sitting space near the window with a lounge chair for resting. The in-room bar was well-stocked, albeit fairly expensive; by contrast, the room service (the burger platter I ordered was delicious and hot) was more reasonably priced, a very high quality, and had a pretty extensive Western/European menu. The hotel staff spoke English quite well, took care to answer my questions and offer help, and this holds true for the restaurant manager as well, a Frenchman who also spoke English. The location was meticulously clean. Perhaps one downside was the lack of much of a bar scene on the premises; the lounge was for little more than that: lounging, before or after a day in the field. I also think the breakfast buffet could have offered more extensive variety of hot dishes."
46,86,"Feb 2 2009 	Excellent in every way.	We stayed in this hotel for 8 nights, and had two rooms. Each room was spotless and very comfortable.The staff were without exception, very friendly and helpful.We always ate breakfast at the buffet, and it gave us a great start for our days of sightseeing or shopping."
47,86,"Jan 15 2009 	All the makings of a great stay	The Novotel is a French chain of Hotels, so you know reputation and quality are somewhat important. You walk into the large open lobby and find a friendly (and very helpful) staff that all spoke English. There was free Wifi and Apple Computers for guests use in the Lobby as well. The Hotel rooms were very spacious, clean and comfortable. Water was replenished everyday along with nice towels and bathroom supplies. Though it is inevitable you'll have to take cabs a lot, I found the location to be very good, considering how spread out and large Beijing is. It is approx. a 15 minute walk to Tian'men Sq. and 3 minute walk to one of the busiest shopping roads in the city, I believe it's called Wangfujing Road. There is a great Food market that opens at night on that road, if you are up for eating Dog, Snake, Squid, and whatever other mystery meat the vendors offer. I did not get an opportunity to try the buffet because it was rather expensive, but it did look amazing.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling who is not on a very strict budget or who can find a good deal."
48,86,Dec 31 2008 	Very central	Stayed at the Novotel Peace several times. It is a good 4 star hotel in the centre of Beijing opposite the Peninsula and close to Wangfujing shopping street. From the airport it will take you about 40min. The rooms are clean and spacious but the decor is a bit old fashioned. If you book one of the Premiere rooms you get access to the lounge. Breakfast is great and offers a big selection of Asian and European dishes. In the lobby there are two computers and guests have free access to the internet.
49,86,"Dec 15 2008 	Great Location Needs Better Maintenance	As mentioned in previous reviews, the location of this hotel cannot be beat. Easy walk to Forbidden City, shopping, restaurants, etc. But the rooms, or at least the room we had, which was booked as an upgraded room (do not recall the exact term, but a higher price than their standard room) was sadly in need of care. The room was large, the bathroom was very large, the bed was comfortable, but the carpeting was worn, the draperies were dangling off the hooks, the TV was old and got poor reception, the bathroom shower curtain was stained, the marble in the bathroom had mildew stains, the towels were small and thin. In sum, the room was shabby, and gave off an atmosphere of poor maintanence. With just a bit of work the place could be brought up in standard and to us, this speaks of poor management (how difficult can it be to put the draperies back on the hooks? to replace a shower curtain? to scrub the mildew off the bathtub caulking?) Too bad, because the hotel is so well located and has such potential, but we would not book there again unless assured that the rooms had been refurbished."
50,86,"Oct 3 2008 	Loved the Novotel Peace Beijing	We have just spent 5 days at the Novotel Peace and it was excellent, my son stayed free as he is only 15, I had read good and bad reviews but decided to stay there, the buffet breakfast was the best we have ever had, even better than the Sofitel in Xian, freshly made crepes while you wait, I had been advised to upgrade to an executive suite which we did, we had a 2 room suite with 2 tvs, my son had a rollaway bed in the other room, the only fault I could find was the bed was a bit hard, this was the only hotel we came across with free internet in the lobby, 2 large apple macs, it was great. The service was excellent, Stephen was our porter when we arrived, he speaks good english and wrote down some names for me in chinese for the taxis. we loved the Novotel Peace and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, it was even better than the Novotel in Shanghai."
51,86,Sep 28 2008 	give the executive floor a go	Somehow - I'm still not sure how- we ended up on the executive floor of the hotel for 5 nights during the olympics. We really enjoyed the perks of this. Private check in. You have an enormous room - although strangly a very tiny bathroom with a leaky shower screen. You have your own floor to take a bespoke breakfast with fantastic views across the city and in the same place every night between 6 - 8 they hold &quot;happy hour&quot; which is free unlimited drinks and food - very civilised. The room service is a fair price (although the food can be a bit tepid) but the buffet restaurant in my opinion is hugely overpriced. In the location you are you are right in the thick of the city so there are plenty of places to eat and right on top of the shopping centres. Nice hotel.
52,86,"Sep 28 2008	Found Peace at the Novotel Peace Beijing	I know this review is long overdue but I couldn't resist telling everyone how grand my experience had been in this hotel.My 3 colleagues and I recently had a business trip in Beijing last May 2-11, 2008. When we arrived at the hotel, I noticed some fixing going on in the entrance just in front of the revolving door. We got two rooms for a 10-day stay in the 16th floor. The receptionist told us that occupants of our room was yet to check out so if we could wait for 20 mins. Well, ok. No worries. We put all our luggages in the other room and decided to have a walk in Wangfujing which is nearby. After an hour stroll, the room was ready and with one of my colleague, we transferred our stuffs to the next room.What I liked about this hotel is the accessibilty to almost everything. It is stratgically located at the centermost part of Beijing. It is a few steps to shopping malls, fast food chains, and banks, a few minutes walk to Forbidden City and the Tiananmen Square, few minutes drive to the world famous Silk Street Market (hehehe), where we hang out nightly, few minutes to The Nest Olympic Stadium and electronic market. You should check the electronic market, guys. I bought a Sony digital camera for half the price here in the Philippines. As the Chinese salesladies say, &quot;It's cheap-ah.&quot; It is also an hour or two drive to the Great Wall in Badaling. Nice view in the lounge through the glass wall where you can see the street outside. The hotel's lobby is majestic. Very well lit,huge, feels comfortable and has a free WIFI access. The staff speaks very good English (thank God), very attentive and helpful. Thanks to the supervision of Ms. Sophie LePage. The forex is a little higher here in the concierge and they do not take a fee unlike when we exchanged money at the airport.The room was clean, spacious, cozy and comfortable. The bathroom was also nice and my favorite place, the bathtub complete with hot and cold water. They tap and shower got a very good supply of water. There were nights that the water was dirty but they inform us in advance that they were fixing some pipes and tanks. They always left a note saying what time the repair would take place and what time the water would be available. Our room was in the 16th floor so I had a pretty much good view of the city especially at night. The food. It was superb. I looked forward for the breakfast every morning at The Square. There were so many choices be it western or eastern breakfast. The breakfast was to die for. The European supervisor made us feel comfortable and always offering us coffee when he could ask his staff to do that instead. I didn't catch his name but I will include him in my photos.The staffs were great. I would like to commend the housekeeper in the 16th floor. My roommate left his wallet in his bed with all his money (US dollars and yuans). He was quite worried and had no chance to go back. When we arrived in the evening, the wallet was beside the bathroom sink. Talk about honesty. Kudos to the housekeeping staff.The not so-bad side. The picture quality of our TV was bad. There were only a few English channels to choose from. The bar was not inspected before we checked in. There were empty cans inside the fridge and some soda stains. And we found out only on our last day. We were lucky it was not charged on us. The indoor pool closes at midnight, the only time we had the chance to swim. I hope they open it whole day round.Overall, yeah, I loved it. I'm looking forward for my next visit here sometime next year."
53,86,"Sep 24 2008	Nice Hotel in a good location	The hotel is really central so location is brilliant to access the malls, forbidden city etc. Whilst there we went to the Badling section of the great wall, we hired a private taxi to do this as they wait for you. This cost us about 50 for the day, on the way we also got the chance to stop by the olympic stadium as the paralympics were on. The zoo is about 15 mins away from the hotel and costs about 2 to get in, was good to go and see the pandas. Didnt think much of the food both in the hotel and outside really but thats mainly because the food is so different to our idea of chinese food but if you are adventurous with what you eat then you wont be short of somewhere to go !! If we ever went again I would stay at this hotel, rooms were fine, clean and had everything we needed."
54,86,"Sep 17 2008 	doesnt quite live up to 4 star rating	stayed at this hotel from agent recomendation, and it doesnt quite live up to a 4 star reputation. I only had a superior room booked, so didnt expect too much, but when checking in to my room i have to say it was very dissapointing. the room just could fit a double bed, not much more, and it was dark, dank, old.i asked to change rooms, and to their credit swapped me into a twin room, bigger, even with two double beds. it had a couch, great view from 15 th floor, and was clean. about what i would expect from a 4 star hotel.breakfast was included , and for the 6 days of my stay, we ate brakfast everymorining at hotel, which is a buffet style, and is one of the best i have seen. lots of choice, all hot, fresh.hotel is in wanfujing area, and is very close to everything. you can walk to forbidden city, its close to 3 different metro stations, and is very well located. hotel has a currency exchange desk, and concierge were helpful at all times... they have their own security who were abit overbearing most of the time, stopping us 3 nighs out of 6, when coming back to hotel late at night. to check if we had a room for 2 people .. other wise a very nice place to stay, but i think 3.5 star at best"
55,86,"Aug 27 2008 	Modern hotel in great location... with a few mishaps	We decided to book this hotel based on the Novotel name (consistent, mid-range quality) and location (convenient for the main attractions) and overall we were not disappointed. It was modern, felt safe, seemed well-maintained and was clean. The room was spacious and well-appointed and the staff (all of whom spoke excellent English) were very helpful.I would recommend the place subject to certain caveats:Hard bed. Our bed was mind-bogglingly hard. I personally don't have a problem with that, but it drove my wife nuts and she hardly slept the whole time we were there. Something to bear in mind.The food. The restaurant tries to do a bit of everything, food court-style, and doesn't really manage it at all.Great Wall trip. The concierge organised a car and driver to take us to the Great Wall. On a previous trip, I had just hired a taxi for the same quite inexpensively, but this time, I was lured into it by the apparent ease of the arrangement. Wrong wrong wrong. The trip was organised round the driver's schedule rather than ours and involved in addition to the Great Wall and Summer Palace that we wanted to see, several stops at jade factories and the like run by his mates that we did not want to see. The first place we played along with, but he was not amused that we did not want lunch at his friend's restaurant (we broke sandwiches) and distinctly unimpressed when he did not get a kickback from the second factory since we didn't buy anything. We were rewarded with the most dreadful driving you can imagine... we're talking narrow hilside roads, on the wrong side and when he took the key out of the ignition when we were moving to start messing with his phone... at 50mph... I had to make him stop. Not a pleasant experience, but at least the arrangement was only cash on safe arrival back at the hotel.Why do I relate this story? Well I do hold the hotel responsible for recommending this lunatic and his downright dangerous driving and interest only in &quot;commission&quot; from the unwanted stops is something that reflects badly on the hotel.The surroundings. The area in which the hotel is located has been massively re-developed in recent years and whilst it is indeed a convenient walk to Tiananmen Square for example (around 15 minutes), the surroundings lack any charm and whilst I personally didn't mind this, if you are looking for an &quot;authentic&quot; Chinese experience, you may be disappointed."
56,86,"Jul 23 2008	Good mid-range hotel - food terrible	Spent four nights at this hotel. Good location for shopping and within half an hour walking distance to the Forbidden City. There were a lot of staff but they were not overly helpful. Tried the coffee shop twice for quick meals but the food was disappointing both Chinese and Western - bland and tasteless - cheaper and better quality to be found outside. Only two English language TV channels. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Overall, a typical Novotel."
57,86,"Jul 9 2008 	Great hotel	Spent three nights at Novotel Peace Beijing, July4-7, 2008. Hotel lobby very nice and clean, front desk very helpful. Currency exchange available, also have business center. Concierge, very helpful with restaurants, tours to Great Wall and other sights. You must try Peking duck, out of this world. Rooms very clean and spacious, although carpeting and bathroom fixtures need updating. The biggest advantage for this hotel, location, location, location. Two blocks to Beijing's #1 shopping street, Wangfujing. 10 minute walk to the Forbidden City. Pearl Market and Yashow Market, short cab ride away (20 RMB). Bring extra luggage, you will need it for all your shopping. Enjoy..."
58,86,"Jul 4 2008 	Good choice in central Beijing	The Novotel Peace Beijing is a nice, mid-range hotel that is reasonably priced and in a good location. The main restaurant offers an excellent buffet-style meals offering both Western and Chinese dishes, and a lot of cook-to-order items. The rooms a bit dated but are, for the most part, reasonably spacious (some rooms in the newer wing are smaller). One problem in the springtime is the hotel's air conditioning is not yet on and the rooms can be stuffy since the windows don't open (except in the newer wing).The lobby is attractive and offers free wireless internet access (internet access in the rooms is available for a daily fee).Serivce was friendly and helpful."
59,86,"Jul 2 2008	Novotel Peace Beijing Wangfujing district	Recently stayed at the Novotel in Beijing, found it to be very good. Very clean, staff spoke excellent English (and French) and were very helpful. The location is almost perfect - right next to the Wanfujing Station for easy access, plus a 10 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. It's also just across the road from a couple of shopping centers as well as many restaurants - we had Peking Duck 3 times! There's also a MacDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC, Starbucks and a Haagen Daas if you need Western Food.There is free wireless access in the lobby, plus 2 Apple Macs were set up for free internet access as well.We stayed in a King size room which had a flat-screen TV, although with only 3 English channels. Room was large, comfortable, very clean. Shower pressure was good (I mention this because I've lost count of the showers that dribble in hotel rooms). We had a room at the back of the hotel and it was very quiet.We didn't eat in the hotel because there were plenty of places just over the road.Highly recommended, though expensive."
60,86,"May 24 2008 	nice place	We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel has a great location, perfect breakfast, good clean room. The service could be better but it's not a 5-stars hotel, right? Be honest, I don't have complains: I had a good time."
61,86,"Apr 19 2008 	The Ideal Place to Stay in Beijing	I have to agree with all the positive comments in the previous reviews, this hotel is ideally located, is to a good standard and is reasonably priced (we were in one of the premier rooms)The concierge desk were helpful in arranging our day trip to the Great Wall, the Summer Palace and a quick look at the Olympic Stadium. They arranged for a driver to take us and stay at each location until we had finished and all for 600 Yuan (just under 50) which we paid upon return to the hotel. They also gave us some good advice about using taxi's ie how to say &quot;turn the meter on&quot; and suggested we make a note of the registration number so a complaint could be made if we felt that we had been overcharged. They also have cards with the hotel name in chinese which are useful to show taxi drivers when trying to return at the end of a long day.The breakfast was great with so much choice (including delicious cooked to order pancakes) although we felt that the buffett dinner was perhaps not quite up to the same standard and a little on the pricey side when compared to outside (but still only 60 for three of us). If you want good chinese food (confirmed by the number of locals eating there) then the Xiu Lan is excellent with the average dish costing less than 4 and the portions are generous, beer only 1 a 600ml bottle. The service was excellent and a couple of the waiters spoke a little english (out of the hotel, turn left and it is approx 100m on the left)If you are planning to go to Beijing I would recommend this hotel as an ideal base. As we were leaving they were just erecting some covering above the main entrance, we did receive a note on our last day saying that the windows are all about to be cleaned, so don't let this put you off."
62,86,"Apr 17 2008 	Does the job	Stayed for a few nights in this hotel and overall it was decent enough. Booked a double room and there were none available so we were upgraded to a suite which was appreciated. The room was spacious and unfortunately a little grubby in places but not bad. Bed was hard but I had no issues sleeping on it. The actual dcor was a little 1970s; brown colour scheme (not in a classy way either) with cheap upholstery.Breakfast was buffet style and pretty good.The location was fine with a ready supply of metered taxis driving past that you could flag down. Get the hotel to write on a piece of paper where you want to go and the hotels name as well so you can get back!Booked my holiday as a package and had two days pre-booked sightseeing with a guide and driver. They were ok but we got dragged to the usual shops/factories and fed pretty poor food. For the last two days I got in touch with Sophia ([--]) an independent guide. She charges about 30 per day and is well worth it. Shell take you to see what you want, take you to proper Chinese restaurants and not drag you round shops or factories. If I had one piece of advice for tourists going to Beijing it would be drop the travel agent. Book your flights and hotel. Get a taxi from the airport (really easy, safe and cheap) and book an independent guide. Youll get so much more out of your holiday.Other than the usual tourist stuff we also visited Chuandixia village. From what I read on the internet I thought I was going to a real Chinese village off the beaten track. After a 2.5 hour drive I got to a village where farming has given way to tourism. Its pretty and the buildings are original but its all catered towards tourists and really not worth the drive. I would also recommend Beihai park. Much much quieter than the forbidden city and in my opinion more interesting."
63,86,"Apr 11 2008 	An average hotel with a nice lobby	We picked this hotel because it was close to the Wangfujing area (walk takes 10 minutes). We stayed here in April 2007. Right behind was a Hutong-like area, but it did not catered for the tourists. Around the hotel, there were places where you could buy food and provisions, and some restaurants. We saw interesting things, like a man setting up a business by the side of the road which repairs bicycles. The hotel has a very nice marbled lobby, and it was quite busy when we were there. Check-in was efficient, but when we were assigned our room, we asked if it was a non-smoking room. It was not, and it took a while to change it to a non-smoking one. Our room was OK, but light on furnishings and decor. There was one problem with the sheets, which were soiled and not washed properly. Service was as you would expect of a Novotel hotel - good. Apart from the lobby, the corridors were narrow and looked tired. Breakfast was not included with out room and was pricey for our budget, so we got ourselves fresh baked breads from a shop round the corner. We asked the porter where could we go to sample the famous Beijing duck, and he directed us to a famous restaurant chain in Beijing. We had the duck there, and it was pricey by Beijing standards. Not surprisingly, it catered for the tourists. On our last day, we found a restaurant right next to the hotel which served Beijing duck for half the price. All in all, we had a good stay at the Novotel Peace, but there were arguably better choices around."
64,86,"Apr 3 2008	Great base for seeing Bejing	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights whilst on honeymoon in Sept'07. Our room was clean and comfy and our en-suite had a great walkin shower, which was welcomed after a hot summers day exploring the city.Lots of choice for breakfast (waffles, fruit, bacon, egg fried rice). Hotel staff very helpful and they arranged taxi's for us to make day trips easier. Good location for exploring the city itself - only a 10 minute walk from Wanfujing Street (modern shopping street). We even walked back from Tiananmen Square one day - but if you're going to do that make sure you're wearing comfy shoes!The hotel has a nice bar to unwind in of an evening - they'd often have a pianist playing - and much to my husband's delight they had their own internet cafe as well.We'd recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a good base from which to see Bejing."
65,86,"Mar 29 2008 	Terrible service and management	I stayed this hotel for my marriage anniversary trip this month. My experience was terrible though I am not sure if I was just unfortunate or the hotel's service is problematic. My room was executive room that has nice plasma TV and free access to executive lounge for breakfast and early evening snack/drink. Breakfast and snack/drink are both terrific. Further, executive room guest has two options for breakfast, either 1st floor main restaurant or 19th floor lounge. Anyone staying over three nights, having two options make breakfast experience much more enjoyable. The hotel has a terrific location too. Very easy access to Wangfujing, Tiananmen, Lama Temple and Temple of Heaven(through newly opened subway #5). Throughout Dongdan and Dongsi street (less than a quarter mile east from the hotel), travelers can find many interesting small, independent artistic shops for ethnic cloths, bags etc. Hotel facilities are somewhat outdated but acceptable. You can see that the hotel tries very hard to keep up with new facilities. Executive rooms are recently updated and have many comfortable features. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone for following reasons (in order of minor to major problems).1. If you arrive, you will receive a letter that indicate variety of executive room previliges, including newspaper every morning. Strangely, they never deliver newspaper to rooms on the 18th floor. I had to complain to recieve it. 2. Do not use hotel's tour service. I went to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs through their service. A group of 6 left 30 mins after the promised departure time. After about 40mins visit to the Ming Tombs, the bus stopped by two shops wasting more than two hours. Then, we went to lunch to have the worst Chinese food in my life. Due to earlier &quot;forced&quot; visit to shops, our lunch time was less than 25 mins. Then, it went to the Great Wall. The guide gave us less than one and half hour. After busy picture taking, the bus visited another shop! - this time, a ridiculously overpriced tea shop in the middle of nowhere. When the group finished the shopping &quot;obiligations&quot;, Beijing was already full of traffic jam. The guide and driver asked me and my wife to take taxi to go back since others' hotel are located in different direction. It was gruesome even though the tour guide found a taxi and paid in advance for our return trip. From 8 am to 6:30 pm, actual cultural experiences at Ming Tombs and the Great Wall lasted less than two and half hours. Considering re-direction and others, forced shopping at three different shops costed us about four hours. For this terrible service, they charged 350 RMB p/p. For some cheap group tour (usually 150-200 RMB) to Great Wall, my experience may not be unacceptable. Nevertheless, for the price offered by the hotel, this is simply unaccetable/disgusting/ horrible experience. I strongly complained the hotel manager and offered two tickets for Peking Opera next night. The only reason I did not complain further and accepted their offer was because my wife did not want to see any disturbance during the trip. 3. The bathroom had two problems. Water drain in the shower booth did not work well sometimes (but not always). I guess it tends to flood when other rooms are using shower booth together. I sometimes had to stop the warter until it drains. Glass wall of the show booth was not fully water proof. After shower, the whole bathroom floor was wet. I complained these problems a couple of times. For the first problem, I got the answer that they could not find any problem. I suggested my theory - drain problem occurs when many rooms are using shower booth at the same time. Then, they said, &quot;we cannot control other rooms' use of shower booth.&quot; Quite compelling explanation! They never attended my second problem until I leave. 4. I booked this hotel because I believed that this hotel is eqipped with bidet (many websites listed it including expedia; someone here also mentioned it). I needed it because of medical reasons. Hence, I cancelled my original reservation at Park Plaza and booked this hotel though this hotel was about 50$/per night more expensive. I could not see a bidet in the bathroom. I went to the executive reception desk. They did not know what bidet is. After a few phone calls, the attendant explained that the hotel used to have it but not anymore. I though I was just unlucky. Two days before I leave, I went to meet an assistant manager to complain three problems I mentioned above here. At the end of the discussion, I briefly mentioned about my disappointment about unavailability of bidet in the room. The manager was surprised. He said, &quot;actually some rooms have it.&quot; I was dismayed. If some rooms have it, why they did not offer an option when I checked in? I was really furious and protested seriously then. Next morning, I met a guestroom manager to protest about this. He apologized and offered a new room. I did not take it as I did not want to pack up and move for just one night (we had some baggage). He instead offered 10% discount. That was meager considering all my troubles. But I just accepted it. My stay could have been happy-ended if my next experience did not happen (# 5)5. When I checked out, the executive floor manager said that &quot;we are giving you 10% discount because of your troubles with water drain and newspaper delivery.&quot; I replied that &quot;no, I did not receive discount because of newspaper and drain. That is because of &quot;bidet&quot;&quot;. The manager said, &quot;what is bidet?&quot; I was entirely lost. It seems people in this hotel is not communicating each other. I guess that is the source of all troubles in this hotel. Did I have to explain all over again why I was unhappy? The room rate was slightly over $200 after &quot;generous discount.&quot; I found that this hotel has a serious problem in terms of communication and management. It seems the hotel is mainly for group tourists and Air France employees anyway. It is not for an individual traveler for sure."
66,86,Mar 6 2008 	Nice Stay	Perfectly good hotel. Handy for Forbidden City and Tiananmen SQ. We were in a premier room and it was excellent with plasma screen HUGE bed and nice robes etc. No problems. The breakfasts were good and the breakfast room was the restaurant at night. It was lacking in atmosphere at night so we went to &quot;Le Cabernet&quot; which was the French restaurant attached to the hotel and just outside to the right. Nice young French manager there and great food at a better price than the hotel restaurant. One tip if you want to go to the Great wall and the summer palace don't book a coach trip Have a word with the concierges who were really good. We had a taxi for 600 Yuan (about 40) for the day and he took us to the wall which was 1-2 hours drive away-the Mutianyu part which is less touristy than Badaling- waited while we did it all then drove us to the summer palace and again waited till we were fifnished and we paid at the hotel when we arrived back. He even took us to the Bird's nest Olympic stadium. Great experience all round.
67,86,"Feb 28 2008 	Great Hotel and Location	I just checked out of the Novotel Peace Beijing and was extremely pleased with my stay. I had booked the Executive Floor room which was well worth the additional US$20 in the price as it included free internet service, evening cocktails/appetizers and full hot breakfast in the 19th floor Club Room with expansive views of the Forbidden City looking west overy Beijing.The hotel is also extremely well situated in the heart of Beijing, 15-20 minutes walking distance to Tianamen Square and the entrance of the Forbidden City. It's also in very close proximity to the Wangfujing pedestrian shopping street. The subway is only a 5 minute walk away. Cab from the Beijing Capital Airport was only 100 RMB. Ask the information desk at the airport to write the name of the hotel in Chinese for you to give to the cab driver. It's located just outside the arrivals area.The guest rooms were amazingly well appointed and recently renovated, at least on the executive floor (17). It would have been easy to mistake this room for one at a W hotel in any other major city. Contemporary and upscale furnishings including a king bed, sofa and coffee table. As with most Asian hotels, the service was great with complimentary bathroom amenities galore, tea/coffee service, robes, slippers and turn down service. The staff even folded my clothes left on the bed when they came in for the turndown service! Cost of the rooms was very affordable for central Beijiing at only about 1100 RMB per night.The buffet restaurant does a great job at providing a nice selection of western and asian fare for about US$30 for dinner. They had a number of vegetarian options.Only a couple of minor downsides... the bed must have been one of the hardest I've ever slept on. The fitness center was not terribly large and had a limited amount of equipment for use. Smoking is permitted in the lobby area which can get a little overwhelming. Tour desk and front desk staff spoke adequate english.Look out for the very large groups of Air France crews that frequent this hotel. They move in large numbers."
68,86,"Feb 4 2008 	A Good Hotel	Chose this Hotel following reviews on this Website, was staying for a few days on a stopover from London to Sydney.I went for the Executive Suite, yet again following advice from this website. The room was great, two LCD TVs, King Size bed, Air Con the works, couldn't fault it in anyway.I used the Exec Lounge for the inc Breakfast and Evening Buffet and this was good. The only fault I would say, as with any buffet, is that if you go at the wrong time the food could be a little on the cold side.I used the concierge service downstairs to sort out a couple of days trips, they were exceptionally helpful. I think it was around 45 for a very nice car and driver for the day. If you can I would recommend getting Mr Kong, his english was excellent and he took me to a very nice authentic chinese for lunch.I used the 24 hr Restaurant as I was leaving, it was nice but not really my thing. I would recommend staying here as it was all very good. It probably lacked a little atmosphere and was very formal but if that's your thing, well fair enough."
69,86,"Jan 26 2008 	new renovation	After staying at this hotel last year I decided to book this hotel again but on the executive leve. I was not disappointed. I checked in on the 19th floor and was given a room on the 16th floor with great views. Breakfast on the executive level was very nice with plenty of food and custom ordered breakfast. Plenty of coffee, juices, fruit, pastries and chinese fare as well were available. The room was very nice with all new bathroom with rain shower and nicely appointed. Everything looks ready for the Olympics and the staff was great. I highly recommend this hotel for its location and helpful staff."
70,86,"Jan 9 2008 	Great value and Location	We booked our stay through the Accor centralized hotline, very convenient. We found our stay a pleasant one, and excellent value for money. Location is top notch, a stones throw from Wangfujing and with many taxis in the area. Certainly a better choice for tourists than the overpriced Penninsula across the road.We were upgraded, and the room (newly renovated West Wing) was excellent, very large with a separate living room/TV area, small bathroom, and adjoining big bedroom space. No lack of space, except perhaps in the cramped bathroom (no tub, only shower). The room was clean and comfortable, and probably worth more than the price paid. Breakfast was a good spread of Continental, American and some (awful) Asian dishes. The Crepe/waffle station was a highlight.Service was moderately displeasing, but not immensely so. Although we booked a twin/double room, clearly stated on our reservation, reception insisted that only bfast for one was included, the other being chargeable (which we disputed, and eventually won). Apart from that and a few other service hiccups, some staff were great, especially the taxi/bell boy and luggage service.Overall a recommended choice for value-conscious travelers."
71,86,"Dec 30 2007 	Good hotel good location good value	We loved:- the central location in Wangfujing: short walk from Forbidden City, night market, great shopping etc...- wonderful buffet breakfast with a French flair eg crepes and delicious croissants among many other stuff.- comfortable rooms, friendly staff- cheap for what you get and in comparison with similar neighboring hotels"
72,86,Dec 1 2007 	Great hotel for a great price	My stay at the Novotel Peace was great. The room was very comfortable and had a great view of Beijing. The staff were first class! Their English was great and they always willing to help. The Hotel was very clean and well maintained. The buffet breakfast was very nice and always looked fresh. The bar was also very nice with great views outside. Overall a very good hotel and when i return to Beijing in Feb 08 i will stay there again.
73,86,"Nov 25 2007 	Good location	Travelling in business I stayed four nights at this hotel. It has a good location close to Wanfujin St and within 20 min walking distance to the Tianamen/Forbidden city entrance. I got a good reception and was able to check in early (10 in the morning). My room was at the second floor and had an immaculately clean bathroom. In spite of having signs warning for the noise disturbances due to the reconstruction of the hotel nothing was heard. The view could had been more exciting but the service offered with the early check in was worth not seeing the Tianamen sq. The concierge desk was very helpful with practicalities as maps, shopping info, directions etc.The breakfast was very good and offered av variety of things.I would definitely stay here again."
74,86,"Oct 31 2007 	Regular guests	My husband and I live an hours drive from Beijing CBD. We attempt to regularly have a weekend in Beijing and the Peace Novotel is our favourite hotel. We have now stayed on five occasions and each time was a pleasant experience.Twice we were fortunate to be upgraded to lovely 17th floor suites but just the standard rooms are pleasant enough. We will continue to treat the Peace Novotel as our 'holiday home'.In order of priority, the main reasons we stay are the: cleanliness, meals, comfort, pool, staff, location, price, coffee, wine selection."
75,86,"Oct 22 2007 	Great stay in the Centre of Beijing	We wanted something in the centre of Beijing and this fitted the bill perfectly; it was a few hundred meters from the night market and the main shopping pedestrian area- this may not sound much but Beijing isnt the easiest city to walk around so having places to walk to in the evening was great. Room was quite small but nicely (and newly) fitted out and facilites were good-pool, small gym etc. Breakfast buffet was great as well. Staff were v friendly and concierge came up with great restaurant recs nearby."
76,86,"Oct 20 2007 	A Good Base	As we booked our stay through a travel agent not sure what we paid. It was called at Superior Room (Room 2202) but was very much like what we would have expected for a Standard Room (maybe they call standard rooms superior there - and then you go up to deluxe, etc) Anyway, couldn't actually fault the room. It was comfortable and clean with a good bathroom. But as it was called &quot;Superior&quot; I was disappointed at the size - not even a table and chair - and certainly no outlook. However, the Hotel itself was otherwise faultless. Right from the time we checked in all staff were most obliging - with the Conceirge staff being outstanding. As we were determined to do everything ourselves and not join any tourist groups or take on a guide, without the help of the Conceirge staff we maybe wouldn't have managed so well.As an example, we wanted to go to the Great Wall somewhere where the hoards of tourists don't go to. They arranged for a car to take us to Simatai, and our climb on the Wall there was about the highlight of our whole stay in China. Only cost 800 Yuan for a full day.The location of the hotel is spot on. We walked to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and the adjoining two gardens. Good shopping, small restaurants, the night food markets, etc. are all nearby. To go further afield, taxis are ever so cheap. The Hotel provides a card with their own name and location written in Chinese, and overleaf the names and locations of about 15 sites also in Chinese and English. Invaluable when you are out and about by yourself. The Hotel also provides a good map. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.Breakfast was excellent. It took ages for the hot water to come through (sometimes 5 minutes). When it did come it was perfect. However the Hotel must have the most enormously excessive water usage because of this.Would definitely recommend this Hotel and stay there again."
77,86,"Oct 12 2007 	Very centralized hotel	Apparently, the rock bottom pre-paid rates guaranteed at accorhotels-asia.com is not a pre-pay situation. We had to pay upon check-in: bring a copy of your printed reservation with rates. Love the fact that kids eat free and b'fast selection was very extensive (most of the AF crew stay here). Bed is very firm (you can bounce coins off it). Least troublesome hotel among all the Accor brands for my entire trip. Good location and close to everything. OBTW, if you're flying into Beijing airport late, go for the hotel arranged shuttle van. No need to give unfamiliar directions to taxi drivers."
78,86,"Sep 9 2007 	Fantastic Hotel with Excellent Service	As I lone woman traveller I read many reviews of hotels in China before choosing this one. I was so pleasantly surprised by the hotel, and would highly recommend it. I was there for 4 nights, my room looked out onto the front of the hotel, I was able to open the window, and even though there was building work going on next door, the hotel advised me of this in a note left in the room. The room was clean, quite spacious, the bathroom was amazing with a huge shower and the room was always cleaned and replenished daily. English was spoken by a lot of the staff, I used the business centre twice daily and never had any problems. Breakfast was excellent, and because the hotel is used by Air France crew breakfast included French crepes. I was able to sit in the bar in the evening writing my diary and was made to feel welcome and the bar staff were extremely attentive. One evening I ate in the French restaurant attached to the hotel, and the food and service were second to none. The location of the hotel was my main reason for choosing it, walking to the Forbidden City takes about half an hour down Wangfujuing Street, the Night Market is just along from the hotel for an experience you have to see, taxis were readily available for further travel, I met with a friend in China and the hotel rang my friend for me and gained directions for the taxi driver. I would hearily recommend this hotel to others, the carpet in the corridor to my hotel was stained, but otherwise it was extremely clean, friendly, and welcoming."
79,86,"Aug 28 2007 	Good value for money	Novotel PeaceSpend 8 nights and Novotel Peace and can recommend it. Rooms are might appear a bit tired, but they are spacious, with sofa and table, toiletry articles sufficient and re-supplied daily. 2 complimetary water bottles, a/c worked well, and we could even open the window. Nice little sitting area created through couch, armchair and coffee table where we could sit in the evening. TV unfortunately offered only small selection of English channels (BBC and a Chinese channel featuring some English programs), no German channel. Bathroom appeared to be very clean and was quite spacious (separate room for shower and loo and bidet  quite practical actually!). Shower head was at a high enough position for European heights, but could unfortunately not be removed. No noise from outside in the morning.  The location is terrific, close (walking distance) to Metro, many huge shopping centers as well as Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. There are also some restaurants further up and down from the hotel (try Qunjude Roast Duck restaurant on 9 Shuaifuyuan Hutong, [--] in small hutong next to Shopping Centre Oriental Plaza and ca. 5 min. walk from hotel). Finding a restaurant further away can turn out to be problematic, since taxi drivers do not speak English and unless you have the address of where you want to go written out in Chinese, I would not recommend attempting to communicate with the taxi driver (at least once a day one taxi driver drove us around and around the hotel, refusing to listen to what we were telling him and although he had the address  also, beware, drivers tended to approach a location that was basically in a straight line from the hotel by circling around town . luckily, taxis are still cheap). Hotel also has French restaurant next door that serves food till a little before 11 pm  pizzas were delicious and large enough for 2 people to share. With a taxi it is about 10 min. with taxi to Silk Market (if there is no traffic jam .) and costs somewhere between 1.5-2.5 Euro (depending on traffic. Pearl Market is about 2-3 Euros. When leaving these markets, avoid leaving when shops close as finding a taxi is very hard. And only use taxis with meters and beware of drivers that want to charge 20 or 30 Euro for the drive!What we enjoyed at the hotel was that the swimming pool (even if only indoor, not deep and not very beautifully decorated) stayed open until 10 pm, which made it possible to go sightseeing, shopping and out to dinner and enjoy the evening swim. Also nice that hotel provided Jacuzzi and sauna and gym (free of charge). What we disliked was that some women were swimming in their clothes and no one really cared when we reported that. In any case, the existence of the late pool must be ideal for familiesBreakfast was good, except coffee. Sadly, Chinese dishes did not state whether they were suitable for vegetarians and staff did not speak English)). Nice touch  weekends it remained open longer. The restaurant where breakfast is served was big and sunny. Also, there was a smoking section, so that should make smokers happy.Staff was very polite, and while only few people could really speak English, all efforts were made to come to understand us.Recommend this hotel to both young and older people, business travelers, families etc. Would definitely stay again."
80,86,"Aug 26 2007 	Loved the Novotel Peace	We stayed 4 nights and thought our accommodation was top class.Because Beijing prices are low compared with our home town (London, UK) we felt able to splash out on the top of the range accommodation. The top few floors are called &quot;executive&quot; and they have their own breakfast floor (with great views, 19th floor: you can see the roofs of the Forbidden City). From 6 to 8 every evening they have a Happy Hour in which you get free food and wine (mostly European food).So while we had a great time there, I must emphasise that we were in the best accommodation the hotel had to offer. There was even free internet connection (I didn't even get that in the Novotel in high tech Singapore). We had a suite, of two large rooms plus large bathroom . Everything worked fine. 18th floor and great views (not much to see, given the pollution, but that's something else...). The bed was extremely large...and extremely hard. I can imagine that bothering some people. We really enjoyed having such a firm mattress so we didn't mind.We had one evening meal at the hotel restaurant on the ground floor. The food is mostly Western and quite poor quality. There's a decent souvenir shop available too.I chose the hotel for its location. It's in walking distance of the Forbidden City. It's further to Tianeman Sq but certainly doable. We took a cab to the Temple of Heaven, as that's a bit further off. Taxis come by the hotel the whole time and are very cheap.The hotel is right by Wangfujing which is a busy pedestrianised shopping street. Very popular on Saturday night! Also close by is a food market street. I walked through the market which was thronged with Chinese early on Saturday evening. Some hideous looking &quot;foods&quot; for sale...from a Western perspective, that is. They didn't mind me taking photos.Unfortunately, there are prostitutes hanging out near the hotel. Also, Westerners are constantly being approached by young people claiming to be students, always asking &quot;how are you? Where you from?&quot; and telling you they want to practise their English. Only one pair admitted that they really were trying to coax me into going into an art gallery. It gets to be very annoying.I had decided against booking guided tours from abroad and I'm sure that saved a lot of money. We booked tours from the hotel. We went with another couple with a guide and driver to the Ming Tombs (where we remembered to ask them to take us to the Spirit Way which has the most amazing statues) and Great Wall. For a whole day's travelling it was, for us, extremely cheap. Also, we went on the Hutong Tour which takes you round living quarters of old Beijing. Excellent.A quick tip about the Forbidden City. Go to the main entrance, and when approached by an English speaking guide, ask to see their badge. Then book them for your personal tour. It's cheap and we had excellent service with the first person to appoach us. No need to book a formal guided tour with loads of people.And go to the Temple of Heaven park on Saturday morning and see the people doing tai chi and groups singing revolutionary songs together."
81,86,"Aug 18 2007	No good	This is another bad Novotel hotel. Stayed in one in Paris (Novotel Eiffel) - we should have known better. Supposedly 4 stars...what a stretch. Service is so-so. Its only saving grace is the western/asian breakfast.Bathroom was moldy - room 1306. While true that others in our group were upgraded, we were not. I am guessing that was done selectively. I will not elaborate further."
82,86,"Aug 11 2007 	Good deal I would return	I stayed at this hotel in March 2007, and found it perfect for my needs.When we first arrived we were placed in a smoking room (being from Australia I forgot that you can smoke in some hotel rooms overseas), we however asked to change to a non-smoking room and had no problems.The buffet breakfast each morning was excellent - plenty of variety and the food was fresh.The staff were quite clueless, but from my experience this quite normal in China. Don't expect them to be able to answer your queries should they deviate from the obvious, and be reminded that most of them do not speak english.The rooms were very clean and were serviced daily.We only had one problem and that was with an international phonecard, that we bought from a shop outside the hotel, to call home. The phonecard did not work on the hotel phones (the staff could not explain why and seemed surprised that it didn't work). International phonecards do not work on public phones either (they only take domestic phonecards). This resulted in us having a $50AUD phonecard that we could not use and could not return. The hotel assured us that this problem has not occured before.I suggest that if you buy a phonecard to call back home (which is much cheaper than using the hotel's rates) that you buy it from the shop in the hotel, and get them to assure you that you can return it should it not work."
83,86,"Jul 11 2007 	My wonderful stay at the Novotal Peace Beijing	This is a very tourist friendly hotel in an excellent location (walking distance to the Forbidden City). The staff is very competent (a hotel guest could not ask for better service than that provided by this hotel's staff), the deluxe room I stayed in was perfect. The tourist information in the lobby is also very helpful. I will definitely stay at this spectacular hotel again."
84,86,"Jul 9 2007	Great rooms and location shoddy service	The Novotel Peace was our first stop on a two-weeklong trip to China. The hotel has a very impressive lobby and spacious rooms. All areas in the hotel were clean and maintained, which was a relief to come back after a smoggy day in Beijing. There was much variety available at the breakfast buffet, though this it was rather overpriced. However, service is another story. The bellboy had his own agenda and tried on several occasions to persuade us to order an all-day touring taxi through him. The Business Center attendant seemed to hate her job and will make this very obvious to you on each visit. The tour to the Great Wall (Mutianyu) arranged through the hotel was small and the site did not disappoint. However, the guide babbled in the beginning and was stone-silent when we reached the site and afterwards. If you would like an informative guide, do not book tours through the Novotel Peace."
85,86,"Jul 2 2007 	Not Recommended	Stayed there for four days. Lots of problems for us. Check-in was easy and they gave us the room we requested: inter-connecting rooms and rooms with windows (after reading the reviews here!). However, upon arriving at the rooms, we found the rooms dirty and outdated. Having stayed here 4 years before when they were undergoing renovation, we wondered why the rooms are still so old. We were given one big corner room (might be the suite) and one standard room. Beds are hard. Air-con on the suite room seem to be not working at all which is a problem for hot summer days! Breakfast was a real chaos; we booked via the official site and they stated that children under 16 do not pay for breakfast. However, when we got to the breakfast restaurant, they told us that the children had to pay! The people who work there could not speak english and kept on insisting that &quot;children don't pay half price&quot; which we don't even say at all. At last we had to go back to our rooms and fetch the booking statement that we printed. The waitress then ask us to go to the receptionist! We had a row first at the receptionist, because after he saw our statement, he told us that breakfast are free if we had ordered the breakfast first from the internet. It was SO ridiculous, seeing that we had stayed at various Novotels and didn't encounter this problem. Finally when we finally had our tempers real on, he gave up and we only had to pay for the adults. By the time we got there we found that the breakfast wasn't so special at all.Overall our stay wasn't pleasing at all -- not with the hot weather with useless aircons, and our outdated room. What makes it worse is that on the day we left, we realized that there are some rooms which is already updated with modern plasma TV and stuffs."
86,86,"Jun 22 2007 	Excellent cheap and central	We thought this was a really lovely hotel. Very central, cheap, clean and comfortable. We stayed here from 3 June 07 for 4 nights.  We contacted the hotel in advance to ask for early entry to our room, which was not a problem. The staff were polite, spoke good English and helpfull. The lobby is very nice and rooms very clean.  The one thing I would comment on, is the lift is at the other side of the building, however, the bell service bring your cases so you don't need to carry them! Oh and when you first sit on the bed, it feels like a solid rock, however, we found it surprisingly comfy! The breakfasts were a bit of a hit or a miss. There was a really good selection, but I found most mornings it was cold. There were freshly made omlettes, and pancakes, however, the pancakes had usually been sitting for a while.  There was a swimming pool, however, we didn't even see it, let alone use it, so I can't comment on that. I would definately stay here again, it was a 2 min walk to the central shopping street, 5 min walk to the nearest tube &amp; 15 min walk to Forbidden City."
87,86,"Jun 9 2007 	A rather bland hotel	We stayed at the Novotel Peace Hotel for 3nights in Apr07. The hotel lobby is probably the best feature of the entire hotel. We requested for a non-smoking floor on our on-line reservations but was given a smoking room. When we asked to have a non-smoking room, we weret told that we will have to wait for at least another 2hrs. As we have young children with us,age 6&amp;9 yrs old and having came in an overnight flight we decided to take the room. The room is spartan with a small window overlooking the delivery trucks coming to the hotel. The white linen on the sofabed had brown stains on them which one can only guess what it is! However, ouse keeping did come to change the sheets promptly. The hotel is about 12minutes walk to Wangfujing. Food at the restaurant is so so. Will we stay in this hotel again ? Most unlikely.Janet from Australia"
88,86,"Jun 7 2007 	Good value and location	Our first hotel in China. We had a nice suite at a reasonable price. Located centrally near the Snack street, Forbidden City and just off Wangfujing. A short taxi ride to most sites that are too far away for walking.Helpfull staff and a great buffet, although a little pricey. Since we were not sure about what/where to eat the first few day we ate a hugh breakfast here and took an apple and banana with us for lunch.Our last day, they stored our luggage all day at no cost ontil we returned to pick it up.All in all a nice place."
89,86,"May 15 2007	No windows!	Location was good, very central. Room was awful. First room didn't have a window, we moved to a room with a blank brick wall 30cm away from the window, then moved to another room but the toilet was permanently blocked. Toilets in the lobby were also blocked, obviously a problem with the plumbing. Bed was typical Chinese - hard as a rock. I am sure there are better options in Beijing."
90,86,"Apr 26 2007 	Great location	For a four star hotel this is good value and in a great location opposite the far more expensive Peninsular. It is a walk, but quite a long walk, to the Forbidden City (take a cab)The rooms are quite comfortable. I was fortunate to be upgrade to a suite until I found that there were no windows in the suite. Seriously there were no windows but a very big suite. It was like being in a cave.The buffet breakfast is one of the best and when you book make sure it is included in your room rate. There are not many other alternatives near by.The bathrooms are a good size athough I don't understand why hotels put in rain shower heads when they limit the flow of water."
91,86,"Apr 18 2007 	Novotel in excellent location	We stayed here for 4 nights, 9 - 12 April, 2007. The staff were great, arranging for an excellent english speaking driver to take us to The Great Wall and other sites around Beijing including acrobatic and kungfu shows - which were actually very good. The hotel itself was busy, with a tourist rather than a business base. It is in an excellent location, within easy walking distance of the major shopping street, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and the night food market. Taxis are easy and cheap to get for other destinations.The room we stayed in was a &quot;deluxe&quot; at CNY884.40 plus 226 for a rollaway bed [ there were 3 of us]. It was a corner room with plenty of space and a view out towards the Forbidden City. The decor was a little tired. We were told renovations were underway and we might be disturbed during the day but we never noticed anything. The bathroom was spacious but a bit dingy and rundown. It didn't matter though, we had a very happy stay and would return - unless the Peninsula Palace over the road was giving away rooms! The Regent is also close by. The breakfast buffet was very good, although expensive by Chinese restaurant criteria, but this is standard for China. I particularly liked the crepes with chocolate! The swimming pool is indoor and an adequate size with a good spa next to it."
92,86,"Apr 16 2007 	Very Decent Hotel	I had a weekend stay at the Novotel Peace Hotel. The location is quite good. It is about 5 minutes from a major pedestrian shopping district and about 20-25 minutes walk from the South Gate of the Forbidden City. The staff are nice. The lady who checked me in spoke solid English and I noticed that the person checking in beside me also had a staff member who spoke solid English. There are staff who have trouble speaking English (however, they speak more English than I speak Mandarin), but there is always someone near who works there who can assist you if you run into any trouble.The rooms are a little older and not very fancy, but they are adequate and clean. My room would not be considered a room for a romantic getaway, but as a tourist, it fit the bill completely. The washroom is also clean and the amenities provided with the washroom are decent (toothbrush, ear buds are included too). There are 2 bottles of water (~300ml each) provided as you are not recommended to use tap water in China. The hotel breakfast is excellent. A buffet of Chinese and Western food is provided. You can get fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast, toast, eggs, bacon, etc. Checkout was very simple and fast. The front desk is staffed with enough people so that the guests do not have to stay waiting that long. They also help with providing maps and directions for the local sights in Beijing.A tour desk can be found in the lobby in case you would like to sign up for a city tour or an extended tour outside the city."
93,86,"Apr 12 2007 	Good location but very old and dirty rooms	The Hotel is very well located and practically everything is accessible from there. We had problems when checking in, because theycouldn't find our reservation even with our receipt and Ref. Number..poor performance of the staff on this section. The first impressionat the lobby was great but not once we entered in our room which was old, dirty and with a terrible view of old houses's roofs. The bath was not enough clean, specially in the shower area.Heating was not working properly in the room, so it was cold. The person in charge of the Business Center, a chinese lady was very rude and lacking of customer focus. Her initial words were &quot;if you want to use Internet be aware the cost is 2 yuan ($0.25 ) per minute&quot;.The main Restaurant was good. Excellent buffets The main value of this hotel is just its location, but it doesn't have the quality service of the Novotel Hotal Chain. This is the first time we are highly dissapointed by a Novotel Hotel, and it was not cheap!"
94,86,"Feb 6 2007 	Good value for money	Hotels are quite expensive in Beijing and given the good rate I got through internet booking for this hotel, the room and other amneties have been above my expectations. I had been given a standard double room in the recently renovated section and the room was comfortable. However, a problem with the shower room door proved to be a dangerous and they required me to move to another room. I was reluctant as I had only 2 more nights and they persisted and gave me a small suite at no extra cost. Overall, service was good and prices of drinks at the lobby lounge reasonable as compared to other hotels and restaurants. I had previously stayed at the Beijing Hotel at double the price and find the Novotel a much better deal."
95,86,"Jan 29 2007 	Rubbish	I stayed at this hotel for two nights at the end of a business trip before flying back to the UK. The reception and public areas were very stylish and contemporary. However, the room I was allocated was a non-renovated room and was shabby and tatty, and clearly in need of the pending renovation. I had booked a Superior Room but fail to see how the room I had booked could be so described. I wouldn't stop at this hotel again, and would not recommend it unless you have a guarantee of receiving a renovated room."
96,86,"Dec 14 2006	Get a suite deal	I booked a last minute stay for two night at the Peace hotel. I went directly to the novotel website and found that I could book a king executive suite for about $135 per night. The room on the top floor so the view was great, and the room was huge. Actually it was like two rooms, one was a large bedroom with a king bed and great furnishings, the other was a sitting area complete with couch, chairs, large tv, and a dining area that sat 6 people. I had two full bathrooms and the executive concierge lobby was down the hall. I had free snacks and drinks after 6:30, and they also set-up a breakfast in the morning. Everything was perfect. I would highly reccomend this hotel, but spend a few extra bucks and get an executive suite."
97,86,"Nov 17 2006 	Beijing's best	We stayed there in October this year and found it to be very clean, and having a large room and great facilities it was an ideal hotel for our pleasant stay in Beijing.The breakfast buffet was the best we have ever encountered in all of our travels, and the bar which faced the street, and had &quot;happy hour&quot; was a great place to unwind after a day of shopping or touring.It is also walking distance to the Forbidden City and the main shopping area as well.We have recommended it to other friends who are visiting Beijing."
98,86,"Nov 11 2006 	Loved the Novotel Peace	Great hotel in terms of both room and service. I booked the deluxe room with king bed and it came with breakfast. Cost was approximately US$100. Great breakfast, great room (big and clean) and great service from the staff. When I first checked in, the safe in the room was out of battery. I called and immediately someone was sent up to replace the batteries. At another time, the tv remote was not working and immediately after calling, a service personnel came up to check on it for me. Great buffet breakfast every morning! Furthermore the hotel was at a fabulous location, right next to shopping and eating area. 10 mins walk to forbidden city and tiananmen square."
99,86,"Nov 9 2006	Excellent location and very good room	Just back from a trip to China. Stayed at this hotel for three nights, much better than expected after reading some comments on this site. We were given a very large corner room with triple aspect windows and sofas, very well appointed and comfortable.Buffet breakfast very good.Some excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.Staff were OK but could have been a little more friendly"
100,86,"Oct 22 2006	Nice lobby great buffet dumpy rooms and you'll want to know...	All the reviews about this hotel are spot on, however I feel compelled to share my experiences in doing business and traveling in China. If I can help just one person avoid some of the hassles and mistakes I have made, I will have accomplished my mission. The most important thing to remember about traveling to China is that the culture is such that honoring a reservation is a distant second to trying to get you to pay more for everything. Don't worry, they don't specifically single out the tourists-- they spend the same amount of time doing this type of thing to one another as they will you. I have booked mutiple reservations (Shanghai, Xi An, Beijing) over the course of several years and many times they have claimed to &quot;lose&quot; my reservation (even the prepaid points reservations from American Express) and I have to fight to get what I have already paid for in some instances. This hotel &quot;lost&quot; my reservation as well. The rate I had for two rooms (prepaid through American Express) was 108/ US per night. Oddly enough, they confirmed that I had paid the full price for both rooms and yet claimed to only have one room for me and a full hotel. Long story short; two calls to american express, four to the hotel and they promised to &quot;accomodate&quot; me when I arrived-- only after complaining-- a lot. When I arrived they tried to make me feel guilty about getting what I paid for by saying they had to kick some other peope out. Imagine the audacity. The rooms are only adequate. When we finally got into our rooms the second room had big stains on the carpet and the first had a broken safe. The beds are stiff as a board. You can walk to the Forbidden City in about 15-20 minutes or take a short cab ride. The hotel will arrange for a car service to take you to the great wall (ask for Ba Da Ling) for about 1200 RMB. I highly reccomend using a car service to go anywhere. Hotel in room massage often includes &quot;extra services&quot; (use your imagination) and they quoted me 180 RMB for a massage. When the person arrives, the price might double or triple so hand them a pen before they start and tell them to write the price down. General advice for traveling in China:1. Bring all of your documents of proof of reservation2. If you book through a third party (like a travel agent) and the third party gives you a confirmation number, don't assume the hotel will honor or recognize that confirmation number3. Whenever I can, I'll ask someone local to call the hotel for me and confirm. 4. If you want to arrange for a car to pick you up (highly reccomended) use VOIP to cheaply call the hotel and ask them to do it for you. 5. Be prepared to haggle for almost everything. Above all, try to keep your cool and understand that this is just part of doing business in China. Usually, if you put up a big enough fuss, they will give you what you deserve."
101,86,"Oct 4 2006 	Great Location	Having previously stayed in Beijing before I wanted a hotel that was central and the novotel was definately this. It's only about a 5 minute walk to the main shopping street and very close to all the main attractions. I stayed here twice on my holiday at the start in July and at the end of my trip in August and both times I had a great stay. Check it was quick and easy with the front desk staff talking good english. The room was large compared to other hotels and even though I had booked a standard room there was a fruit basket in my room. The hotel also provide small bottles of water in your room free of charge. The bathrooms in the standard rooms are not all that impressive and are a bit out of date but they are clean.On my second stay I arrived early in the morning (7am) and had expected to not be able to check in until later, when I asked at the front desk my room was not ready however they decided to upgrade to a suite even though I had booked a standard room. This room was awesome, it had a bedroom and connecting lounge room and the bathroom was really nice. The resturant I had breakfast two of the mornings I stayed and I can't fault the food, it was good. I'm a chef in a hotel and often examine what people serve for breakfast the novotel had a great range of foods. A chef was cooking fresh pancakes, waffles and crepes for you. Another was cooking eggs. There is a section of freshly cut fruits, traditional chinese breakfast, cereals, juices, whole fruits. It is expensive (120CNY I think) but it is worth it if you do eat alot for breakfast and the food is of a high quality.The front desk was a great deal of help and so was the bell boys and concierge. They assisted me in instructing the taxi drivers were to go, plus they have small cards with a whole list of tourist places in both english and chinese, good to give the taxi drivers.This is a hotel I would stay at again"
102,86,"Sep 11 2006 	Good Location	Stayed August 30- Sept 1 2006A$230 for 3 nights ( wed thurs fri)Booked directly through hotel website as they were cheaper than all other avenues ( hotel websites, agents etc)Location-GreatFacilities-GoodStaff- PoorFound staff to be below average, the porters very pushy! I wasnt even out of the cab before the guy was trying to get me to book a car with him to go to the wall. When I said it was to expensive and I would want to check around for prices, he said he knocks off at 4pm, and if he hadnt heard from me he would come to my room! Then a few hours later another one started on at us.Reception staff were clueless, I had communicated over email several times before my arrival saying that we fly out of Beijing at 10pm on the 1st so require the room only till 6pm, so a half day rate applies. We were charged the full days rate but I didnt argue as they were kind enough to check us in at 8am on the day of arrival. When we did check out at 6pm they kept asking why we were leaving early. I handed over my frequent flyer card and the cashier said I couldnt use it as I had booked with an internet agent. I explained I booked direct with hotel. She took my number down but its yet to appear on my account....I know these things can take time so I will wait.Room was in old wing and we knew we would be getting an old room for the price we paid. Wasnt expecting a filthy bathroom though, the orange mould in the bathroom and shower was pretty horrible and easily wiped away by myself with a towel so not sure why a housekeeper couldnt do it. I have stayed in some very basic accomm in my time, but would never have expected that at a Novotel.The resturant wouldnt let us order off the menu at breakfast and insisted its buffet only and we need to order room service if we dont want buffet. We ordered continental for room service following day and several things were missing. However did order early dinner room service on day of departure and food was great, huge portions and fast service."
103,86,"Aug 29 2006 	Nice downtown location	Nice hotel in a great location. Pleasant lobby bar with good prices and good music. Terrific breakfast buffet.If the 10-15 minute walk to the major attractions is too far for you, a cab is less than $2.00 USD. Lots to do within the 10 minute walk range.Staff was very helpful in arranging tours and trip to the Great Wall.Would definitely recommend this property."
104,86,"Aug 20 2006 	Well situated but overated	We moved from the Marriott West to the Novotel because of the convenient location. The entrance to the hotel is spacious and beautiful. The people at the desk were very helpful but we could not see a room when we came to check it out. We decided to give it a try and stayed 5 nights. We were put in a room in the &quot;newer&quot; part of the hotel. The room was a good size and the beds comfortable but that's about all the positive things I can say about the room.It was very, very dirty: dark stains on the blue carpet, stains on the grey, old curtains, stains on the lamp shade, poor lighting, and broken cheap furniture.The walls also needed a serious coat of paint as they too were very dirty.The electric tea kettle was melted at the rim from the heat and I ended up with piece of pastic in my cup of tea. The bathroom was also in very poor condition. The towels were very old and the sink was chipped and had old black dirt marks.I talked to the manager and explained how surprised I was to see a room in such poor condition in a 4 star hotel. I ask her to come and see the room. She did, and she seemed very surprised when she saw all I was pointed out in the room. Within 2 hours, she called us to tells us that she was putting us in a Deluxe room on the 16th floor. The room was a bit cleaner and there was newer, more sturdy furniture,the sink in the bathroom was also chipped, but overall, we were not impressed. The best part of this hotel is the location and the food. The breakfast and dinner buffet were excellent with a large variety and good quality of food."
105,86,"Jun 29 2006	Excellent value great location great food	This was the second time I stayed there and both times were great. I rate it a standard 4-star, but at very resonable prices. The rooms are modern, clean, and large. The location is excellent; you can walk to the Forbidden City. Best of all is the amazing buffet breakfast/lunch with both western and eastern food. When we first ate there on this trip, we pigged out for two solid hours! (Mind you, we had just spent the previous three weeks in northern China and Russia.)We had a small problem where we were too close to some construction in the hotel, so we had to ask them to move us, which they did."
106,86,"Jun 1 2006	Good hotel great location!	I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during May 2006 and really enjoyed it. My room was clean, spacious (two beds) and on the 14th floor away from the road noise outside. In fact the whole hotel was nice and quiet. Bathroom was fairly basic but the room had everything you could want. Good small pool in the hotel, with sauna etc which was again always quiet.Staff had a reasonable amount of English and the concierge were helful in finding restaurants etc. The main restaurant in the hotel had a buffet most days which I didn't fancy but the one occasion I did eat there the food was good! Someone else mentioned air crew, and they were plentiful. I think they keep the hotel going! but not a problem.You could walk to the main shopping street and some good restaurants, and in 15 minutes you could walk to the Forbidden City. Taxis are plentiful in that area, but be warned you need your destination in Chinese (the hotel has some handy cards with the main tourist locations in Chinese for you).Just down the road is the Chinese night food market - one for those who want to try something different! It's an experience! Only once did I experience hte pimps outside but a simple &quot;no&quot; got rid of them. They are everywhere in China so nothing particular to the hotel.I got a taxi from the airport which cost around 80RMB which wasn't bad but I was lucky with the traffic. In fact I got taxis around most of the city as they are cheap - never consider driving as traffic is mad!"
107,86,"Apr 26 2006	over rated hotel- two levels of accomodation which they don't tell you.	.We were a party of 5 adults and had two rooms. (1 couple in one room and 3 singles in another. The couple got 'upgraded' to a superior room whilst we 3 had a triple room in the West wing. Well, the west wing rooms left a lot to be desired. Our room in the west wing was in bad condition with peeling wall paper, well worn furniture and carpet which badly need to be replaced. The whole wing was in desperate need of refurbishment to bring it up to a 3 star standard. The bathroom was old yet clean though water pressure was poor. It was a big contrast our friends (the couple) who were upgraded to a 'superior' room. Their room was what one would normally expect as a 'standard room' in a 4 star hotel- definitely not of superior standard. It was what you would expect of a NOVOTEL hotel room. Whereas our triple room in the west wing left a lot to be desired- Im surprised NOVOTEL are not embarrassed at the condition of the rooms in this wing- it is not what you would expect of a NOVOTEL and am surprised at the lack of consistency as usually when you go to a NOVOTEL hotel you know what level of standards to expect"
108,86,"Apr 13 2006	Not sure it warrants 4 stars	While the common areas of this hotel are very nice, the rooms don't seem to live up to that promise. Rooms are quite basic, beds are very uncomfortable and bathrooms are very ordinary - don't even think abou taking a bath!However breakfast was very good, as was dinner the one night we ate in. The location was very good with good restaurants and shops nearby. I was there with a group of girlfriends and the location felt very safe. The hotel seemed to be used by Air France for their staff overnights, and some mornings/afternoons/evenings, we'd go to the lobby for drinks and every available (empty) table would be marked as being reserved for Air France.A large group of us arrived at the hotel at check-in time (2pm) with our luggage, and only one of the 6 rooms was available and the reception staff were pretty unsympathetic.Found reception staff and staff at the bar/coffee lounge to be rude on more than one occassion.Overall - we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again if the price was right."
109,86,"Mar 23 2006	A very good comfortable 4 star hotel	This was our first hotel on an extended tour of Beijing. We enjoyed our stay there and were very happy with the hotel. We were not expecting it to compete with the five star hotels but it offered good decent accommadations, a great breakfast and a wonderful time.Unlike the previous writer we had no problems out and about on the streets. Wangfujiang is close by and we happily ate at a local dumpling restaurant with no problems. As two women, we never felt threatened or harrassed. We looked like tourists but had no issues. There are great night food stands on Wangfujiang near the hotel - we did not eat at the stalls but it was fun to watch all the 'action'.Breakfast at the hotel was very good! Initially it didn't seem like much but we soon realized that all the hot dishes were around the chef stations along the back wall (the containers are recessed so you don't really see them). Croissants, as befitting a hotel with a French background were excellent.Our room was good, decent, clean, of a 4 star quality. Ethernet Internet Access for a fee in the rooms with a daily maximum I believe of 60RMB or 100 RMB.We enjoyed our stay there and would return there again. There are very reasonable rates when you check prices on the Internet for this hotel."
110,86,"Feb 19 2006 	Gotta be kidding	Had a conference in Beijing on Friday and decided to stay the weekend there at the Novotel. At a corporate rate of RMB650 or USD80 including breakfast, all taxes and charges, I stayed at what was supposed to be a deluxe room on the 16th floor. The room was, at best, equivalent to a three star hotel in the US, featuring quite worn carpet, a small television, an old couch and a hard but huge king size bed. The bathroom however left a lot to be desired - shower had little pressure and experienced an initial shortage of hot water. Breakfast on the other hand was quite good, especially when you stick to the western selection - fried eggs, bacon and salmon. Chinese pastries and fruit proved to be ok, not great.I think Air France and Aeroflot put their crew up at this hotel so it gets a fair share of airline thoroughfare. AS WITH EVERY SINGLE HOTEL IN CHINA, BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF PIMPS WHEN YOU ENTER AND LEAVE THE PREMISE AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN. I did not think the location was that great, it is definitely close to the Wangfujing Pedestrian Mall but you have to walk the entire length of the Mall to get to the metro stop. AGAIN, BE PREPARED TO FOB OFF THE PIMPS.A local taxi from the hotel to the airport will set you back USD15; or USD30 if you opt for a hotel car transfer. Pick the latter, it's worth it. Beijing taxis are a complete bloody disgrace. Overall, an okay experience."

1,89,"Excellent stay	I stayed at the hotel 3 nights with a twin deluxe. The employees were helpful and always pleasant. The location is very close to the subway and a WU mart (south of the subway station) (like a mini walmart) for shopping. Its about a 15-20 minute walk to the birds nest. I walked there and took the subway back. Official Cabs are cheap, so its a good choice if you have a lot of bags to the airport instead of the subway (only use official cabs to and from the airport) its easy to tell which ones are official and which ones are not. If someone at the airport asks if you need a taxi say no. Then go to the official taxi stand at the airport. It cost me about 50-60 Yuan for 2 people from the hotel to the airport. The subway is easy and excellent to use and the best way to get around (without alot of luggage). The bakery near the Wu mart is also excellent. I was pretty concerned with getting food poisoning and had no issues with the bakery and WUmart for food. The rooms were very clean with a big stand up shower. Every night the staff brought oranges to your hotel room. It was a great stay and I would go again."
2,89,"Nov 7 2009 	Excellent	Great location close to subway and within walking distance of the Olympic stadium although it is a longish walk. Very clean, modern with little snacks supplied to each room in the evening. Each room came with a pet goldfish. Stayed there a few times and would definately use it again. Its a real bargain. Restaurant next door is pretty good too."
3,89,"Nov 5 2009 	Highly Recomended ! Good Value and good rooms	Traveled to Beijing in Oct 2009. Stayed in Orange hotels for 3 nights. the room is clean but relatively small. But it is not an issue. 1st night i felt that the pillow has some smell, have requested to change it. after that is fine.5 mins walking distance to MRT station. There is one Nine head eagle (???) restaurants beside this hotel, it served delicious food. with hotel card can get 10% discount. I recommend it to those who stay at orange to try it."
4,89,"Oct 29 2009 	Wow..Excellent Price and What a Bargain	We intially had stayed at the Orange Hotel in Hangzhou and was impressed with the price, cleanliness and service at this hotel. The hotel in Hangzhou was new so it is very clean.We tried the same Orange hotel in Beijing near the Water Cube. The price cannot be beat. $29 US for regular room or $33 for a larger Deluxe room. This is a bargain considering the other hotels we were at before. The service people are excellent. We wanted noodles and they walked us to the restaurant nearby. They do not speak English very well so you are on your own with any lengthy or customize requests. I used Google translate and show them the chinese display for customize requests. They will get you taxi, write places in Chinese for the taxi for you to go to.The room is large; Larger then the Comfort Inn in the US. Clean, but not ultra clean; Similar to Comfort Inn. The bed is hard by my standard so be aware of hard matress. They do not provide breakfast, but drop off pastries and milk cartons at night for breakfast. There is wired and wireless Internet in each room. There is not a supermarket nearby, but they sell waters, juice, etc at the front desk. We walk half to 3/4 of a mile to Wu-Mart (similar to Walmart) for juice, fresh milk, yogurt, chips, water, cookies, crackers, etc. Wu-mart has a second floor that sells electronics and pretty much anything you need for a house hold. Our kids like Pizza so a Pizza Hut is a 20 minutes walk or 10 RMB with a Taxi. To go to Pearl market on taxi, the cost 40 RMB. To go to Silk market, the price is 40 RMB. There is some traffic during lunch and also between 6-7 pm pending the direction that you are going to with the taxi."
5,89,"Sep 24 2008 	Paralympics - Orange Hotel	We stayed in the hotel during Paralympics and it was excellent for that since it is very close to the stadiums (cca 2,5km).It is also very close to the metro and bus station (cca 500 meters), but taxi is very cheap and if you have address in Chinese it is very good option. From the hotel to downtown you will need approximately 30min which will cost around 40 RMB.The hotel is new and very clean, but the receptionists did not speak English so we had problems communicating with them.Hotel does not offer breakfast, but every night we were getting some bakery products, milk, and tea (free of charge).If you want to drink some good coffee you can find it in hotel Tibet (100m).We paid 30 Euro for 2 people in deluxe room and I believe it is excellent value.If I was going to Beijing again I would stay in this hotel since the ratio of price and service are very good."
1,96,"Aug 10 2009 	Good hotel - a bit far from the city center	We stayed in this hotel for three nights and enjoyed our stay. We were in a large room with a free internet connection available directly on the TV. The hotel staff was very friendly although their english was a bit poor.The hotel is located about 15 minutes drive from the city center. Except that it is not really conveniant, it's not a big deal since taxi fares are really low and it is usually easy to find one.We would definitly return it that hotel."
2,96,"Jun 27 2009 	Very nice hotel	Hotel was very good although it boasts four stars it's more like three stars. The hotel is owened and run the police dept. !!!! Yes thats right, the cops own and run the hotel. Can't complain really about it. Only thing was after a week of staying there I had to ask them to changethe bed sheets and vacuum the floor. But i mean i had a large flat screen with free internet in my kingsize bedroom. Staff had limited english but were usually willing to help where possible. Infact the manager (female) asked me out one day - lets just say not only the weather was hot...."
3,96,"Aug 5 2007 	Great Value!	I am writing this review at the Peixin - the computer in the room is an excellent bonus! I have just read the previous reviews and would like to comment that this is my 7th hotel in China and the beds are the same firm matress everywhere, so that is a non-issue. There only IS one English language TV channel - CCTV channel 9 - in China, so you can't blame the hotel for that! Yes, the hotel is a taxi ride from Tian'amin Square but the ride is 12 Yuan - les than $2 - and takes 10 minutes, which makes this hotel great value. The rooms are clean, my single has a king bed, and the room is quite spacious. The breakfast buffet is very good and great value for 20 yuan - served from 6:30 to 9:00. I had a problem with this computer and housekeeping was at my door within 5 minutes to solve the problem. The hotel is non-smoking which is a pleasant change from most hotels in China, and is listed as a &quot;Green Hotel&quot;. I booked on-line and the price was a lot cheaper than the posted rack-rate at the hotel. I would definitely recommend the Peixin - great value for the money."
4,96,"Mar 31 2007	very nice hotel	The hotel is very near Hongquiao market and some malls. The staff are quite friendly and helpful, though some may have difficulty in speaking English. You can exchange your dollars to yuan at the front desk. Before going out, ask the front desk clerk to write in chinese characters the place where you would like to go to. The room is big enough for two people. There are no good views though, one side faces a school area and some residential areas. Overall, i think the place is wonderful and i will definitely will stay there again when i go back to Beijing."
5,96,"Aug 4 2006	Great	Hotel is nice. Rooms very clean. Front desk staff have limtied knowledge of English BUT they do their best. There is a small gift shop that sells trinkets and personal items should you need them. The hotel is convenient to Pearl Shoping Market. It is about a 10 minute walk. Streets perfectly safe to walk around. There are a few small stores around, a McDonalds just down the street. The morning breakfast buffet at hotel is good. The coffee needs work though. (so does most of China)There is an atm machine in hotel. They also have a currency exchange at front desk. They take most currency at reasonable rates. Beds are firm as in most chinese hotels. There are computers in rooms with free internet access. It can get frustrating using them as they have a Chinese keyboard and you need to type all IN CAPS in order for the English not to convert over to chinese. Still, sending a quick email home without costing anything was great. Limited english speaking television."
6,96,"Oct 20 2004	Okay Hotel	Pro's: InexpensiveCon's; Poor location, far from most areas of interest -10-15 minute taxi ride to most major city center sites. Uncomfortably hard beds -like most Chinese state run hotels."
1,103,"Nov 2 2009 	tired hotel poor service	We have been here for a few days.Since the snow came on Sunday,there has not been heating working in the hotel and the dining room is very cold.The management are unhelpful and blame the government policy of no public heating until Nov 15th but the Hilton nearby and other hotels are heated.Breakfast and evening buffet are only adequate-this hotel is showing its age.Internet is 9 per day."
2,103,"Oct 14 2009 	A lovely hotel with a staff that works hard to please you!	IntroDuring our 18 nights in Beijing, we spent a week at this hotel because we prefer Marriott properties and the rates were 600RMB a night during the national holiday week. We began at the Beijing Courtyard, and moved towards the airport to this hotel before the 60th Birthday Celebration closed many downtown streets for several days. This hotel provided a clean, safe haven for a restful and relaxing vacation.The Front Desk and ConciergeBoth were helpful and did what they are trained to do. We used their services daily for getting cabs and ice buckets delivered to the room. It helps to remember that while they speak some English, most of the staff don't understand much English. As we know few words in Mandarin, communications were a problem most places in Beijing. Even with a hotel card from the concierge providing your destination's directions, be prepared to have a cab drop you at the wrong bookstore or restaurant if you do not have the exact address of the place. And just go with the flow because you may find you like the place where you were taken by mistake!The RoomsOur first room was 1011, a suite facing the rear of the hotel with a view of a huge construction site. While we loved the huge size of the room, it was very long and narrow with just one window at the far end from the bed. They are building a skyscraper just behind the hotel, and we heard construction noise most of the day. Fortunately it was not so loud it disturbed us. The king bed was comfortable, and the room was quite clean. The minifridge and safe were wonderful for storing our laptop and cameras. There was a 500RMB weekly charge for the internet, which required a cable they supplied. There was a large tub and a shower stall in the roomy bath. The A/C kept the room comfortable as it was humid outside most days. The electrical outlets cheerfully accept most kinds of plugs.After a 3 day trip away from Beijing, we returned to room 1002, a suite facing the front of the hotel and the main street. This room has several wide windows on the bed side and seems much brighter. It has a separate living area rather than just being one long room like 1011, and provides more privacy if you are traveling with children or friends. The Gym and Pool We did not use the gym, but the rooftop, indoor pool was heavenly. There are few places in Beijing where you are not surrounded by too many people, so It was wonderful finding an empty pool for swimming laps. Swim caps are mandatory in China for both sexes. Beware of the steep drop into the pool from the two step ladder; I fell backwards almost breaking my knee when there was no third step. There are no stairs into the pool, so the two ladders are the only way in. Take someone to keep you company as there is no one on duty inside the pool, and it is dangerous to swim alone anywhere.The Club LoungeDue to the national holidays, many facilities were closed in the hotel. The bar, club lounge and pool were closed during part of our stay. The two times we visited the club lounge were fine; it had the normal food and drinks and a view facing the street. It does give you another quiet place to relax if the crowds and weather bother you. The Restaurant The sunny, main restaurant is to the right of the lobby. We felt right at home there and ate breakfast and often another meal around 4 or 5. We loved their Western breakfast buffet and the eggs cooked any way you wish. For the later meal, we enjoyed their mostly Western menu of steaks, burgers, and salads and their Japanese dishes. Our goal was to remain well enough to attend a family reunion of sorts at the end of our stay, so we ate most of the time in the hotel. Having experienced serious food poisoning a few months earlier, we were on the reserved side of the food/restaurant choice issue. We did enjoy several dinners at local restaurants, but chose them with care. Location This is a tough subject because we liked and disliked the location. It was nice being in a quieter part of Beijing after a 12 nights near busy Tiananmen Square. But there were few places that interested us within walking distance of the hotel. We did enjoy the indoor flower market a few blocks behind the hotel (on the other side of the construction zone.) The stalls selling aquarium fish and live coral were amazing. Do take your camera. Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive in Beijing, so we had few problems getting around by taxi. The insane traffic is another story. Take a detailed map and a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet book in your bag because you will need it most days. We did visit by cab the 798 Arts District up the road about 15 minutes from the hotel. We expected too much and were disappointed by the quality of much of the art. It is an interesting neighborhood for roaming around if you like to hike long distances and explore weird art. ConclusionWe loved this hotel and would return in a minute. The only reason it did not rate 5 circles was the location being distant from most attractions and having few desirable places within walking distance. Being from a small town, we found the hotel did provide a safe cocoon in a town of 15+ million people, and that is a remarkable feat in itself."

We had no time to visit Beijing itself, but wanted somewhere within 30 mins of the aiport.I booked a club room in order to get the inclusive airport transfer, which worked out cheaper than paying seperately for both. The airport pick-up was seamless, the hotel staff helpful and courteous, the room comfortable, and the bathroom spotless. On the way home we were upgraded to a suite, which was a nice surprise, and had time to enjoy the excellent buffet breakfast.I'd definitely recommend this hotel."
4,103,"Jun 18 2009 	The Location was excellent	We left another hotel to check into the Rennaissance. Can you say UPGRADE. We loved the location of this hotel because my husband is a Starbucks coffee acheiver and one is attatched to the outside of the hotel on the left. There are also 4 others in the area; he seems to have GPS when he needs their coffee. The hotel is also surrounded by excellent restaurants. Try the hot pot one whith the elaborate red arch across the street. We walked to the subway daily which is a few blocks away and a great bargain. The subway is the best way to see everything on your list except the great wall. The signs are in english and Chinese. The staff gave us a map that was wonderful and we saw many things we wouldn't have seen or known about if we had been with a tour. The staff will also write notes for you in Chinese and English so you can show it at your destination. The lounge is comfortable and well appointed. They make great Lychee martinis among other things. The vocalist and acoustic piano player were recording worthy even if I hadn't stayed there I would have gone over there to see the act perform. Thanks Rodney (F&amp;B Director) for having such a great staff and for helping me find the Donkey restaurant, it was delicious. My husband and I frequented the dumpling place to the right of the hotel lots of mornings because they were delicious, fresh and affordable and filling. The owner would put them in a bag for carryout when we were going on early morning treks around the city. We stayed at the Renaissance for 9 days and would stay there again just to revisit the restaurants and see the staff."
5,103,"Jan 23 2009	OK Location OK Hotel	Overall impression during our stay of this hotel was decent. It is a bit far from the city/main tourist areas, and cab drivers seem to have a hard time finding this place (even using the direction card from the hotel). It's about 35-45 minutes to the Forbidden Palace area. The hotel is not close to the metro, you will have to take a cab to get to the metro, about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms, bathroom, furnitures were definitely on the US hotel scale. The lounge served breakfast, beverage, happy hour, and had 2 computers for guest use. The ladies that worked there were friendly, but generally left you alone unless you need their help (significant departure to our horrid experience at the prefer guest lounge in the Le Meridien Shanghai). There's peking duck restaurant down the street (walk out the hotel, to the left, down the street until the next main intersection), reasonable price, service, and good selection of dishes. We saw an episode of Anthony Bourdain in Beijing having dinner in a noodle shop, and always wanted to find that place (there are probably 2000 noodle shops in the city). Upon asking the hotel staff, they recommended Noodle Loft (exactly where Anthony filmed that segment)...excellent noodle."
6,103,"Jan 9 2009 	Wonderful Hotel 	I loved my stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is pretty much brand new. I've read lots of other reviewers complain about the location, but my husband and I thought it was wonderful. Its outside the main downtown area, so yes its about a 15 minute ride to the forbidden city and tiananmen square, but it was such a more meaningful experience to be in a more neighborhood setting. The hotel is located on a long street full of restaurants and bars filled with all locals. We had amazing food that we definitely wouldn't have had if we were staying in the more touristy areas. For example one night my husband had all kinds of seafood cooked in 5 different sauces, while I had amazingly fresh vegetables that came out plate after plate after plate and our whole dinner was only 15 dollars. Also we found great shops with every kind of trinket you could think of, at amazingly cheap prices, because we weren't in the main tourist area. There was tons of shopping for anything from clothes, bags, luggage, to furniture and antiques. The employees at the hotel were so helpful and went out of their way to accomodate in any way they could. For instance we arrived at 3am and their kitchen was closed, yet they still found someone to get us some room service since we were famished. We just really had a fantastic time at this hotel. I guess if you are planning to only be in beijing for a day or two and see only the forbidden city and tiananmen square then maybe this isn't the place for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in more of the chinese culture and if you will be traveling anywhere outside the city (for example to the great wall or something) then this location is much more convenient and a better choice."
