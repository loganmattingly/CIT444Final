28,530,"May 27 2008 	Superb Value For Money	I've stayed here previously in 2006 and wasn't terribly impressed but we have just had a very positive stay this weekend. The standards have really improved and the rooms, corridors and the breakfast area all refurbished - I was pleasantly surprised. Our room was large, clean and well equiped and the breakfast was varied and tasty. My only two dissapointments were the standard of reception staff - very uncheerful when we arrived coupled with a late check-in so our room wasn't ready (we arrive at 12:30pm!) and the Night Porter was very rude when he had to let us in at 1am (who doesn't stay out late in London?) - we were made to feel like naughty teenagers!However, overall this hotel is much improved and excellent value for money - espcially considering the great location off Regent's Street. I would recommend this place to anyone on a budget who wants simple and straightforward accommodation, just don't be put off by the surly staff."
29,530,"Mar 30 2008 	Astor Court Central Location	Astor Court was a very central hotel close to regent street and oxford street.room was basic but very good, a continental breakfast was included and the staff were friendly.Bed was comfortable and got a good sleepwould recommend this hotel to anyone"
30,530,"Mar 28 2008 	Best bargain in London	We booked a quad family room and were delighted when we arrived to a spacious 2 bedroomed room. It was spotlessly clean, beds were comfortable, ample supply of towels and sufficient cupboard and wardrobe space. Continental breakfast, included in price (99 prpn), was enough to get us through til lunchtime. Staff both at reception and in dining room were very pleasant and assisted with all enquiries. We chose this hotel because of central location and price and we were not disappointed. Of course decor and furniture could be updated but It was a lovely surprise for a budget hotel and if we return to London we would definitely go back to Astor Court Hotel."
31,530,"Mar 16 2008 	Good value Great location much better than the crappy hotels around Russel Sq	Choosing small London hotels with great locations can be dicey. Had a number of upsets around the Russel Square hotels with terrible &quot;value&quot; hotels. Astor Court is small, very freindly service, great location 5-10min walk from Oxford Circus. Rooms are fairly new. Only complaint is that there was no hot water for a morning shower. I will return to this hotel."
32,530,"Feb 18 2008 	Great location	First impressions after a 26 hour flight wasnt the best, but the reception guy was very helpful and was able to get us a room when we arrived. Check in is usually at 2pm and we arrived at the hotel at around 7am, so they were very gracious at being able to check us in straight away without charging an extra night's rate. Kind enough to also offer us breakfast when we arrived.All in all an old but charming hotel (a little overheated but cant be too picky). Found that hot water wasnt always on in the early hours of the morning, but a good enough excuse to sleep in. The hotel itself is in a very good location (quiet and central, close to shopping and all transport). Breakfast was rather blah, but that's to be expected with most of the hotels anyway! I wouldnt bat an eyelash if I had to stay there again."
33,530,"Feb 17 2008 	Good budget hotel	We stayed for 2 nights in early February. The hotel is small and quaint but in a great location for exploring central London. The large construction site nearby did not give us any problems and overnight there was virtually no noise from the nearby main road. The rooms are clean and spacious but there isnt much wardrobe space- 6 hangers on a rail and no drawers. Breakfast is your average continental spread, which was enough for us. Ideal hotel for mini break on a budget."
34,530,"Jan 31 2008 	Central but dated.	I needed a centrally located hotel for one night as I had an appointment nearby the following morning so going on the fairly favourable reviews for the Astor Court on Tripadvisor, I booked it. The location is excellent just 5 minutes from oxford Circus and as a previous review stated, there is a big construction site right across the street. I was in a room facing this street yet I had no problem with noise. The receptionist was efficient and friendly and gave me a room even thought I was a little early arriving for check-in. I was allocated room # 31 which was spacious and clean but badly laid out. It was probably a little overfurnished and the very comfortable bed was through and arch into an area which was really too small to accommodate it. The decor was oldfashioned with lots of plasterwork and coving. Like many older buildings the various electrical modifications added over the years detracted from it. The window seemed to be missing the net curtain which might preserve the modesty of the guest from the occupants of the buildings across the street. An expanding cord from which it once hung dangled bare. The bathroom decor was of the same vintage with a mish-mash of electrical conduits and exposed water pipes and a curtainless window. The fittings were ancient - a cistern with a chain (very early last century) - and a mis-matched collection of tiling completed the outdated effect. This is a very well located hotel and is a good resting place for one night but I do not imagine that I would fancy it for a longer stay. On a positive note, the shower was powerful and there was ample towelling. With a bit of investment and imagination this could be a great hotel. The unsupervised luggage storage and the friendly welcome are an advantage. The 87 rate rescued it somewhat but I would in future probably spend a little extra for more modern lodgings."
35,530,Dec 2 2007 	Leader of the Band	I lead a group to theatre and overnight stay. I booked 4 rooms at Astor Court because of its reasonable rates and location convenient for walking to Oxford Circus / Palladium Theatre.All in my party agreed that the rooms were spotlessly clean and surprisingly spacious for a budget hotel.This was my first visit but certainly not my last. Well done Astor
36,530,"Nov 19 2007 	Clean nice and good location	We stayed here for 2 nights 13th-15th of June this year. I was very pleased with the location and the cleanliness of the hotel. Large room, ok breakfast and nice staff. The only thing that was annoying was the construction site on the other side of the road, a lot of noise. But I absolutely recommend this hotel, as a matter of fact I'm staying there this December also, can't wait :-)"
37,530,"Nov 1 2007 	Clean hotel Lacks facilities for longer stays	Booked through Superbreaks - 110 BB, well continental breakfast. Hotel is excellently located just round the corner from the BBC Studios and minutes walk from oxford street.Bedroom and bathroom very clean although decor a bit dated, thin walls but fine for a one night stay - lack of business facilities."
38,530,Oct 29 2007 	Top class location	Really nice hotel in the central London. 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street. The rooms were clean. We had a little problem with the toilet. We could not flush to often :-)The breakfast was okay. There was a great selection. The staff was friendly.Can only recommend this hotel!
39,530,"Oct 26 2007 	SUPERB VALUE	We stayed at the astor court for one night for a &quot; mums and kids &quot; trip. We had booked a triple room but were given an apartment with two bedrooms. Superb! A break from the kids for mum and they didn't have to listen to my snoring!! The hotel was clean, the staff friendly, they even opened a second dining room for us. Great location, will definitely stay again."
40,530,"Oct 4 2007 	Not what I Paid For!!!	There were problems with our flight and I phoned the hotel to advise them that we would be arriving late. The Receptionist confirmed the booking (2 single en-suite rooms) and told us it would be fine to check-in late. When we arrived at the hotel (at 1am) we were advised by the Receptionist that our rooms were gone and that the only thing they had left was an apartment with two rooms but had a shared bathroom. This is not what we had paid for, and as we were work colleagues the situation was not ideal (luckily for us, our respective spouses did not have a problem with this arrangement). However at that time of night there was not much we could do but we were not offered any compensation for this inconvenience, either that night or the next day. I am very annoyed as I had called a number of hours earlier to ensure everything was ok and to turn up at that time of night after a stressful flight to be told or booking had been changed without our permission and with no compensation offered, was completey unacceptable."
41,530,"Aug 19 2007 	Better than expected!!	Having read some of the reviews for this hotel I wasnt expecting much but was pleaseantly surprised. My group had two double rooms which were clean and of average size. Toilet and shower are inseperate areas in the room which was weird but both were clean. Building is old so rooms a little dated but nothing too bad.The receptionist was very friendly on our arrival and other staff we met were friendly too. Was dreading breakfast due to some of the reviews but again was pretty pleased. Room IS too small but breakfast was plentifuland staff were constantly bringing in fresh supplies of croissants or rolls when they were running low.My main negative was the noise, traffic outside( we were on first floor) and then noise of people walking in room above us very creaky floorboards however when i put my earplugs in I fell asleep quickly.All in all for the price(you get what you pay for) and the location I would recommend this hotel."
42,530,"Jul 9 2007 	Decent well located	We stated at Astor Court for four nights in June. We had requested a high floor and ended up on the fourth floor at the back of the hotel so that the street noise was not too noticible. There was daytime nioise from a nearby construction site, but that's London these days. We could feel the tube trains faintly, but it did not bother us. Our room was small, but had a separate lounge with the TV and much-appreciated blackout curtains, as the London sunrise is very early in June.The bathroom was old-fashioned, but clean and had a full bathtub. The cleaning staff was very nice and efficient. Breakfast was crowded with lots of families and kids jostling for cereal and seats. It is continental as stated. We were glad for a break from heavy &quot;full English&quot; breakfasts. We loved the location. It is close to Oxford Circus with plenty of restaurants, the British Museum, and even a launderette within walking distance. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would return."
43,530,"Jun 19 2007 	Noisy Stuffy Dirty Noisy Unfriendly and Noisy.	The reason we chose this hotel was its location - it's a short walk from Oxford Circus and the West End, which made it ideal.Unfortunately, we found the staff were unfriendly and unsympathetic; the room was dirty; the noise from the building site across the road was all-pervading (even with the windows shut); shutting the windows made the room feel unbearably humid and stuffy; and the bolt on the lavatory door had a tendency to fall apart - I was trapped inside what appeared to be the world's most cramped toilet cubicle for a good five minutes before I could unlock it.The breakfast was rubbish, too - where were the bacon, eggs, sausages, and so on?This hotel was a blight on an otherwise fun trip to the capital. I had more sleep the time I spent the night at Paddington Station. I strongly recommend staying elsewhere."
44,530,"Jun 2 2007 	Roomy but Worn	My family of 5 stayed at the Astor Court for 3 nights in March. It was the only hotel that would accommodate 5, but there is not much else positive to say about it. (We stayed in one of the two bedroom flats.)The room was old, bathrooms small with marginal water pressure. Breakfast was cereal and pastries. Creaky. The front desk staff was not very helpful.The only positive was location - good walking distance to the tube and an interesting neighborhood. However, next time in London we will stay somewhere else. For what we paid, or maybe a little more, we could have gotten two rooms in a much nicer hotel."
45,530,"May 15 2007 	Perfect Location	Had a weekend break recently and found the location of this Hotel superb. It is situated just a stones throw from Oxford Circus.On arrival the receptionist was very friendly and efficient and let us leave our luggage in the store room as we had arrived quite early.We had a double room on the fifth floor and it was more than adequate for our needs. This IS budget accomodation and as such is good value. Although the rooms may be a little dated, it just adds character to the hotel.Breakfast can be a little chaotic simply because of the size of the dining room but the staff ensured that food available was plentiful.Would strongly reccomend this hotel for its location and value"
46,530,"May 13 2007 	Well located but dirty and with a very bad service	I booked this hotel after reading a good review in tripadvisor but when I arrived the situation was completelly different. All the employees treats you as if you were invisible, so you have to take care of your self by your own. My room room was really dirty and, personally, it's the place where you are afraid to let your stuffs in the room. It's suposse I would stay 7 nights and after my first night I departed to another hotel."
47,530,"Mar 13 2007 	Perfect for a weekend away	Me and a friend stayed in the Astor Court Hotel for two nights in a recent weekend away in London.We booked online through a booking agency at around 66 per night for a twin room bed and breakfast. We weren't sure what to expect as London hotels are typically rubbish! But we were very impressed and it was a perfect base for our stay.The hotel is really easy to find and 10 mins walk from Topshop (perfect!).The breakfast was standard continental but fine for us! You could have as much as you wanted and the staff were really attentive and cleaning the tables, stocking up food etc. On the Sunday we had to wait about 20mins for a table but that was because everyone seemed to come down to breakfast at once!I would reccomend this hotel for short breaks and just as a base only, for this it is PERFECT!! The rooms are standard but clean and really have everything that you need. We didn't have much interaction with the staff but everything was running smoothly so we didn't need to!!"
48,530,"Feb 26 2007 	Decent Hotel!	Location was the important aspect of this hotel for me and it was pretty good. No more than a 10 minute walk to Oxford Street and Great Portland Street tube station is 5 minutes away. We found the hotel hard to find on our first day but it was only because we weren't used to the area..it was easy to find every other time.Rooms were fine. Furniture may have been a little outdated but that wasn't important to us. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean, thats all we needed!Breakfast was complimentary and very enjoyable-fruit juices, tea/coffee, toast, croissants, cereals, yoghurt etc..Would probably stay here again!"
49,530,"Feb 25 2007 	Noisy	Great location, being only 5 minutes from Oxford Street - shame about the noise from outside as in the middle of a building site, was directly above the underground so every couple of minutes a tube went underneath and very busy road with traffic outside until early morning+ neighbours in the next room coming in at 2AM banging, shouting, laughing , singing etc. Wouldn't even open their door to talk and listen to our complaints. Staff in the morning not too helpful as the answer when I complained was &quot;They are bad men, staying 4 in a room&quot;..so the hotel allowed 4 single guys to stay in one room.Strangest thing was the ultra violet light shining outside the entrance throughout the night which shone through the gaps in the curtain making the room look like an extra in an ET movie.Breakfast was ok but not enough room, we had to quickly grab a table that had just been vacated while oyhers were told to go away and come back when less busy as no tables were available.Room was large but the bed was very hard and pillows like 2 blocks of concrete.Guess I could say I would never, ever stay there again."
50,530,"Feb 12 2007 	good location	I have just spent a weekend at the Astor Court and it was a really enjoyable stay. I have read the reviews before going there and I can confirm that the rooms are a bit old-fashined. My room was quite large, and toilet and bathrooms were seperate. I was staying at the 4th floor and I could not hear any noise from trains or the tube, as it was mentionned in other reviews. The TV-set was not working properly, there was only sound but no picture. When I informed reception, they did not seem to be very surprised about that.Breakfast was good, with croissants, pain au chocolat and other bakery and cereals. But no ham or eggs. The most negative impression was from the plastic tablecloth which gave the whole breakfast room a very cheap and uncomfortable look. But in general it is a good hotel in a nice surrounding with several restaurants and pubs nearby."
51,530,"Jan 5 2007 	Wonderful service centrally located	If you're looking for a cheap and very cheerful place to stay in central London, I can definitely recommend the Astor Court. We arrived quite early (before 1) but the hotel was happy to check us in anyway and allowed us to leave our luggage in the storage room so we could be out and about. (They also offered to let us wait while they got the room ready but the shops were waiting!)The rooms are fairly small, a little shabby, with old-style doors (with doorbells!) on the rooms - but everything was very clean and tidy, and rooms included tea &amp; coffee making facilities, built-in hair-dryer, trouser press, etc.The best thing about the place, however, was the service. Maybe all the staff had just got a raise or something because everybody was smiling, very helpful and pleasant about any request. I stay in central London with work quite a lot, and found the service and general attitude here to be far above the usual you get at hotels 3 and 4 times the price of this one!Breakfast was a simple, continental affair but very filling - cereal, yogurt, toast, juice, fresh brewed coffee (no instant stuff!), buns, pastries, the works."
52,530,"Sep 16 2006	Homely	I stayed at this hotel for two nights in London as I was on a weekend course at Westminster University.When we arrived I was a bit apprehensive as it looked old fashioned. It took ages to pay as the hotel payment system was not working and would not accept my card. They said it was their fault and after 20 minutes asked me for another card. There was a language problem which was a pain too. I did not have another card and stood there and eventually my card worked. I was concerned as I thought we might be thrown on to the street. They were meant to take payment as we left!!Anyway we had a ground floor room which had a separate lounge and although dated, I liked it. The bathroom was big but grotty although it was clean. The breakfast was average, I would stay there again but I heard they did it up and it might not be the same."
53,530,"Sep 2 2006 	Ideal Base but avoid the breakfast	We stayed at the Astor Court Hotel for 2 nights in August and found the 2 bedroom appartment we booked very spacious and ideal for families with children. The rooms were tastefully decorated, very spacious and included all the facilities necessary including a kitchen, again very useful if travelling with children. Overall, we felt the appartment was extremely good value for money. My only gripe was the breakfast which was very poor ( and obligatory inlcuded in the price) but given the price of the appartment this still made a good value for money accomodation and there is a good cafe just around the corner. Would definately recommend as a good tourist base."
54,530,"Jul 8 2006	Nice hotel in good location if you don't mind the noise of the trains	Dont stay here unless you bring your earplugs! While the hotel is pleasant enough, I found the noise and rumble of the underground trains passing beneath the hotel to be very disruptive to sleeping, even on the 3rd floor. My first room was on the 2nd floor but the drain from the basin in the bathroom was barely working and I couldnt get any hot water so I was moved to another room the next day. Both rooms were quite spacious with nice period details in the dcor but with an odd layout - a bit more like suite than a room. The sitting area had plenty of space with a desk, chair, large armchair and occasional table. But the space around the bed(s) was very cramped due to the small hallway leading in from the corridor. The bathroom had a good sized bath and overhead shower. The toilet was situated in its own room off another tiny hall but the hotel needs to move the paper holder off the door where it can easily catch you when walking out - I had the bruises to prove it. The continental breakfast was good with all the basics provided. The location was only 10 minutes walk from Oxford Street and there was a little convenience shop a couple of blocks away. There are also some pubs nearby. I found some of the staff to be helpful but the receptionist the night I arrived was not welcoming and very off-hand when she pointed out that the lift wasnt working. As a woman traveling alone, Id particularly chosen hotels with a lift and having just arrived from a long haul flight I was tired and not happy at the prospect of hauling my bags up three flights. Fortunately a fellow guest came to my aid because the hotel was clearly not going to offer any assistance. My check out wasnt much better. As I had to leave at 6.30am Id asked Reception to book me a taxi to Victoria. Instead of a black cab, I was provided with a mini-cab and a driver who didnt know the address and had trouble finding it  all for quite a high set charge. While the rooms are pleasant and the location good, the rumble from the trains would stop me from staying at the Ascot Court Hotel again."
55,530,"May 4 2006	average hotel with a decent price	we stayed at astor court for four days with 2 friends. the room was adequate for 3 persons. clean. and the bathroom also was spacious. tha location of the hotel is very good. only 5 min from oxford circus.the only problem we had is of economic nature. although we decided to pay in front the whole amount when we arrived, as requested by the hotel, on the day we checked out they told us that they had made a mistake and haven't charged us the tax . when we told them we had money only for the train to the airport and that was not our fault, we were told (very impolitely) that the card i had given to make the reservation would be charged. and we didn't even hear a &quot;sorry&quot;.of course that event doesn't characterize the hotel. only that the personnel wasn't very polite.other than that the hotel was what we had in mind for a 3-day trip to london.only the breakfast was not satisfying so we decided to eat out every morning although we have paid for it."
56,530,Apr 25 2006	Great Value Hotel	We stayed at the Astor Court for the weekend and would definitely recommend it to our friends and families. The location is brilliant and is only a few minutes walk from the tube. The hotel and room was spotless and the breakfast was fine for what we needed. The area around the hotel was safe and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. Could not fault it in any way.
57,530,"Feb 10 2006	Location location location!	This hotel is all about location and price so don't go there expecting 5-star treatment!!! Probably not a great place for a romantic weekend, but fine for singles or groups of friends. I'd certainly stay there again.Good things about the Astor Court:1. Only 10 minutes walk from Oxford Circus on a quiet side street2. Not very expensive considering its central location3. Very clean, decent-sized roomBad things about the Astor Court:1. Rooms badly need redecoration2. Terrible shower - basically an old fashioned bath-tap attachment - not very user-friendly and the bathroom floor ended up soaked every morning!3. Very limited breakfast - in a very drab, dreary basement room4. Not very secure luggage store room - it's near the front door and is never locked"
58,530,"Feb 7 2006	Cheap Basic - suited us perfectly	Myself and three mates needed somewhere cheap to stay for one night in central London. The other reports on here seem to be fairly accurate. It is basic, nothing fancy but that was ok with us - it cost just 25 each for a room with 4 single beds. Decor not great but bathroom very clean. TV worked ok. Beds very narrow. Some noise from party goers above our room who had returned from a night out at about 2am but that's not the hotel's fault. Breakfast room small and couldn't all get seated together but cereal, toast, croissants were adequate. Most of the people staying here seemed to be under 30 years old. Great location - just 10 mins walk from Oxford Circus towards Regent Park.If you're expecting comfort, relaxation in plush surroundings this isn't the place for you. If on the other hand a cheap room is the most important thing to you, then it's definitely worth a look."
59,530,"Dec 21 2005	Very Nice	My husband, daughter and I spent 4 nights in a triple room. I found the beds to be comfortable and had very warm comforters on them. The only problem, was with the extra bed, it was very tippy. We put the waste basket under the end of the bed to keep it stable. The room also had a desk, comfortable arm chair and coffee table.  The en suite bathroom was in 2 rooms. The toilet in one room. The very large tub with shower and the sink were in another room. There was also a closet with hangers.  The room had been recently redecorated, new carpeting and beautifully painted. There is an elevator. The room was very quiet (we couldn't hear our neighbors). It's located on a side street so no street noise. Continental breakfast was included. It was adequate, nothing exciting."
60,530,"Nov 15 2005	pleasantly surprised!	I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this fine hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor....a friend and I stayed a couple of weeks ago and it was great, especially for the price! The location could not be beat--it doesn't get more central than Oxford Circus for the price...and it IS in one of the safest neighbourhoods, right nearthe business district(pople claiming that the area is unsafe obviously haven't been into the dodgier parts of London!)..Picadilly Circus is a fifteen minute walk, and the shopping in the immediate area is fantastic...you could walk to most major attractions in 25 minutes or less...and you could certainly walk to your hotel alone after midnight without any concern.The hotel is just in the process of being renovated (floors 4 and 5 are complete; we stayed on the 4th floor) and the renos are very good(no mustiness whatsoever). The cleanliness of the hotel was fantastic ( I have stayed in much fancier hotels that have had less pride in their cleaning practices), and the staff absolutely lovely--they even made up our room ahead of schedule upon check in so we could take a much needed nap.  Breakfast was simple, but be realistic--IT&quot;S BREAKFAST. If you are looking for something more, pay for it.I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation."

1,531,Excellent hotel	I actually purchased my room on priceline and was not sure what to expect because price was quite reasonable. When I arrived at hotel i was pleasantly suprised. It was a lovely hotel with extremely helpful front desk staff. It has beautiful public space and rooms are comfortable with free minibar and wonderful hot showers. The location was perfect as well in heart of Mayfair. Hotel is highly recommended.
2,531,"Above and beyond my expectations - perfect location amazing service.	Fabulous place to stay for adult travelers or families. Stayed with 2 kids (8 and 6)- children's concierge was amazing...brought movies, a Wii, Monopoly, kids' maps,...- gave the kids plenty of activities to be content after a long day of sightseeing.Perfect location - across from park, quick walk to Buckingham Palace and walking distance (10 mins) to Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and London Eye, short walk to tube stations. Staff was attentive and accommodating to every request.Would absolutely recommend this hotel and stay again and again. A hidden gem!"
3,531,"Fabulous Hotel	What a truly Fabulous hotel, I booked this hotel on laterooms.com for a romantic break with my partner. We arrived at the hotel and the staff were very polite and friendly ( yes and the doormen! :O) We were told that we had been upgraded to an apartment that was very nice with a bath, huge bed, living room and kitchen. The bed was so comfy that me and my partner had trouble getting out of it in the morning.The nice late check out meant we could relax and use the sauna and spa rooms and well equip gymAs it was a fleeting visit we didn't have time to use the bar or restaurant but they looked fabulous.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. It was centrally located with a two min walk from Greens park tube station and a hop and a skip to Buckingham palace. We saw a show in the evening and again it is a 10 minute walk to theatrelands West End or 2 tube stops.fabulous fabulous fabulous! stay at the Athenaeum hotel If you want to have a glorious time in London.Georgina Hurcombe Documentary Producer"
4,531,"Nov 20 2009 	Your Second Home	This is how a hotel should be! As you arrive, the charming doormen give you the feeling that you are at home! They are extremely polite and friendly! Check-in was great, due to an early train, we were already able to check-in at 9 AM! The concierge is amazing, he can make any last minute reservations for you. The spa is very practical as well ,especially after a long day in London. I am always sad to leave, but I know that I will come back. Once you've stayed at the Athenaeum, you just don't go to another hotel, it is just too addictive!!!"
5,531,"Nov 17 2009 	Afternoon tea- Could Have Been So Much Better!	I booked afternoon tea for me and 7 of my friends as a treat for my 28th birthday.Meeting friends for afternoon tea is generally something I only do on special occasions and have had a few in various locations around the country/world. After reading a few reviews and hearing about awards that have been won for the teasat this hotel I was expecting high standards but was left feeling very dissapointed. We arrived on time for our booking but was told our table wasn't ready! We were advised that we could sit and wait and was pointed to a lounge area where we then had to organise ourselves extra chairs to fit around a small table. We had to wait 20 minutes for our table to be ready during which time nobody came to ask us if we would like a drink or take our coats or anything while we was waiting (not a great start).When our table was ready we was escourted to a nice table the ambience, decor and lighting in the area was all very pleasant. Those of us that wanted it were served a glass of Kir Royal (then somebody came to take our coats after we had sat down and started our drinks) we were shown the tea menu which had a substantial selection of teas. The table was layed with blue cups and plates and yellow cups and plates one thing i noted while we were wating was they seemed to have been put down in no particular fashion e.g. one persons place setting might have had a yellow plate, blue cup sitting next to someone with a blue cup and plate and so on, not that that bothers me but I would expect a little more attention to detail from such an establishment (You might expect to get odd cups and plates in a greasy spoon cafe). I also had an oyster fork laid in my place setting rather then a cake/dessert fork like some of my friends had in their place setting.We were then served our sandwiches after a substantial wait (a theme that runs throughout the tea) a little shocked I was expecting tea before sandwiches or at least someone to take our tea order (baring in mind not everyone in my party wanted a Kir Royal and we had a 20 minute wait for our table.) The waiter silver served your chosen sandwiches onto your plate dainty finger sandwiches with the crusts removed (fillings as specified on the menu of the website), Again I felt disappointed the specialty breads tasted like the run of the mill supermarket pre sliced loafs and the fillings were so thin you could barely taste them. The finger sandwiches were also cut to odd sizes and the second round of sandwiches seemed to have a little more filling then the first (which was a good thing but demonstrates the lack of quality control and consistency.) The waiter took our tea order between rounds.After our sandwich plates were cleared and a little wait our tea finally arrived for me and my rather parched friends. The waiter poured your chosen tea for you and then pots were left on the table. After finishing our first cups and waiting a while we realised nobody would be coming to top us up so we started to pour our own cups some of the pots were quite large (where 2 people were sharing the same tea) and because the pots were silver the handles were red hot and although little paper napkins were left on teh handles this was not adequate to prevent you getting burnt and the pots were very full and therefore heavy the girls in my group could not pour there own tea safely so I had to do the honours with the additional help of my linen napkin. The warm scones arrived next (plain and fruit) with clotted crem and home made Jams strawberry and raspberry the strawberry jam was far to runny more like a lumpy coulis then a jam.A pink cup cake was brought out with a candle in it for my birthday which was a nice touch happy birthday was also printed in chocolate on the plate with pink candy cains, flowers and blackberrys.The dessert trolly was brought around next where you were able to choose 2 cakes each I was happy with the birthday cup cake and a piece of chocolate cake from the trolly however both were very disappointing very dry almost stale tasting was actually hard to swallow like mixing cement in your mouth so only eat a bite of each. (My friends were not to impressed with there cakes either one fruit tartlet definatley did not look home made.) The tea finished with teacakes, crumpets and butter but our knives had been cleared with our scones so we had to ask for more so we could butter the teacakes and crumpets (by which time both were cold when the knives arrived) I must also mention the dinning room chairs were also very uncomfortable to be sitting in for prolonged periods we all had back pains at the end of our teasBeing my birthday I had reserved an area in a nearby bar for drinks after but because my table was not ready and the extremley slow service I had to phone ahead to advise I would not make my next booking until later. (I had not envisaged afternoon tea taking 3 hours) I requested the bill which arrived but then the lounge seemed to empty of staff after 6:00pm so ending up leaving my friend to settle the bill (when staff were available to pay.) so we could dash to our next reservation.So in summary a very disappointing experience the service was shabby I have never experienced a service managed in such a manner a different waiter/waitress carried out a different task for each course(e.g. a different waiter served the sandwiches then another for the tea and another for the cake etc) which is why I believe there was such long delays between courses there was not 1 waiter to look after you throughout the meal and therefore monitor your progress and meet your needs. I'm an accomplished cake maker and i could have done a much better job with the cakes then that was on offer at this establishment.Theres much better afternoon tea venues out there including the Park Lane hotel next door!"
6,531,"Nov 15 2009 	A perfect choice for a stay in LONDON	This hotel is not to be compared against other 5 star hotels. Its a unique boutique hotel which just gets better every time we stay there. We always look forward to being greeted by the loyal doormen, Jim or John and the reception staff, who always greet you with a smile. We have stayed at this hotel on many occasions over the past 3 years. They have thought of everything to ensure you have an enjoyable stay. The Childrens Concierge is an additional luxury service, as they can organize activities; supply you with computer consoles and board games. The staff uniform is also worth mentioning, as it complements all the staff and you dont feel your ordering your breakfast with last nights menu all over the waiters shirt. The location is great as its only streets away from Bond Street and surrounded by an endless list of restaurants. However the lunch and evening menu options are great value with traditional classics, cooked with a modern edge served on fine china and silverware.Breakfast at The Athenaeum is great way to start your day, with a wide choice of locally sourced healthy specialties. A personal favorite of mine is the Regents Park Honey. The cooked breakfast is just as it should be its spot on! There is only one thing that spoils a good breakfast and thats miserable staff, something you definitely will not find at this hotel.The bar is a cosy area to enjoy a drink of any kind surrounded by people enjoying themselves. If you do have time there is a great choice of top magazines and newspapers available around the public areas.The rooms have been recently renovated with soft light welcoming tones, which follow through and lead you to a welcoming luxurious bed with luxurious linen and perfect pillows.The rooftop suites overlooking Green Park have dream views of London. There is a free mini bar on all soft drinks and free Wifi and an ipod docking station. The white marble bathrooms in the suites have televisions and the sumptuous bathroom products by REN are a perfect choice to pamper yourself with.The hotel just seems to get busier and busier every time we stay, Its the perfect choice for a London stay."
7,531,"Nov 10 2009 	friendliest staff yet	How refreshing it is to be greeted with genuine warmth by friendly staff. From the cheery doorman to the cheerier( if this is possible) receptionist , this is the welcome you expect, but rarely receive, from a 5* hotel. The rooms are spotless and a good size. If you can get a room overlooking green park you will be delighted. The bathroom is alsod size and tastefully decorated in marble.Non alcoholic drinks and snacks are FREE in the minibar. Non alcoholic drinks and snacks are FREE in the minibar. This is true, pick yourself up off the floor.What a lovely, friendly top hotel, in a top location. Handy for bus and tube and all the super Mayfair/ St James's shops.Many other hotels charge similar rates, but only a couple nearby offer such genuinely friendly, helpful staff.Ace."
8,531,"Nov 6 2009 	Maybe My Favorite Hotel Ever	We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel. It was quiet luxury without any of the uptightness that can sometimes happen. We were greeted warmly, showed up to our fabulous apartment (an upgrade from the double room we had booked) and treated kindly the entire time we were there. There was so much to appreciate, from the courteous staff, to the cleanliness, to the artistic special touches and the intimate alcoves in the Whiskey Lounge and tea room. Even the ammenities were wonderful- and appreciated the free internet in the business room. Didn't have time to take advantage of the spa or restaurant, but we will next time! We had a fabulous stay All we can say is Thank You."
9,531,Nov 5 2009 	The Athenaeum Hotel	What an awesome place to stay. Right on Picadilly in London across the park form Buckingham Palace. They treat you like royalty!
10,531,"Nov 5 2009 	A never to be forgotten weekend	Just spend a wonderful night in a rooftop suite. A bed like sleeping on downy air, fantastic views over the park, breakfast in bed, intermingling with sitting on the balcony in the fluffy robe. It was my 60th birthday and this was a wonderful surprise. I could hardly sleep after an evening with bubbly and friends in the suite and then dancing at the Dover St jazz bar. The Athenaeum staff were absolutely charming. Standing on the balcony looking over at Big Ben and the Wheel, with all the wonderful autumn colours of the park was just the best. If this is 60 give me more of it!!"
11,531,"Nov 4 2009 	A true ""home away from home""	I have stayed in the Athenaeum apartments twice in 2009 and would recomend them to anyone staying for a few days or more in London. The location is great for sighseeing or business and the apartments are wonderfully fitted out. Service from the staff is excellent particulalry at breakfast in the restaurant. I will always stay there when in London"
12,531,"Nov 3 2009 	PERFECTION	The Atheneum Hotel is PERFECT.It was our &quot;home&quot; for 6 days, while in London the last week of October.Customer service is impeccable - from doorman, to bellman, to front desk, chambermaids, concierge. Everyone is happy, friendly and polite no pretenses.Our room was amazing - luxurious and comfortable bed, linens, towels, robe, slippers. Lighting, A/C &amp; heat control right next to your bed. Bathroom has all the luxurious amenities one may desire for and more. They provide REN bath products, mending kits, shower cap, cotton buds, facial cotton. Heated towel rack a huge plus.Stunning view of Green Park, extremely lovely in Autumn when colors are changing.5 stars for free Wifi and unlimited free supply of beverages (cola, water, coffee - Nespresso machine to boot, teas, hot cocoa), snacks of nuts, crisps and chocolate bars. A skip hop and a jump away to Green Park underground and an M&amp;S - grocery store. A stroll away from various high-end shops and restaurants.The Atheneum is sheer perfection, a hidden gem in London.Thank you Atheneum staff and management."
13,531,"Nov 1 2009 	I just didn't want to leave	This hotel is perfect in every way. The staff are the hotels secret ingredient to a superb stay as they are welcoming, friendly, efficient, helpful and professional. The decor is really interesting and a bit quirky with artistic touches that make me smile. the rooms are comfortable with heavenly beds and pillows, lighting that can be adjusted to bright, for people like me who are not seeing as well as they used to, or muted for a more romantic touch. They are well equipped with free soft drinks, snacks, nespresso coffee ~(or instant if preferred) slippers and lovely warm bathrobes. Good REN bath products including both shampoo and conditioner (so much better than the all in one variety) big fluffy towels, powerful shower, good bath and, for a change, free wifi. What could be better than a good nights sleep in a lovley bed with a fresh cup of good coffee and the paper in the morning, in a room kept beautifylly clean and fresh by wonderfully efficient chambermaids and people who seem genuinely interested in your having had a good day/night and then after wandering back after the theatre to be greeted with &quot;welcome Home&quot;. This hotel is heaven."
14,531,"Oct 31 2009 	An absolute gem	My wife and I stayed at the Athenaeum sadly only for one night on the 17th October.We have stayed here a few times before for a treat and never been disappointed,our last stay was no exception.We were checked in speedily and also greeted by name which i thought was a nice touch.As it was our wedding anniversary the hotel very kindly upgraded us to an Apartment!!!! WOW it was the size of our house! very very comfortable and made our stay all the more memorableThe one thing that makes this hotel is that its family run and all the staff are so helpful and friendly.We cant wait to go back"
15,531,"Oct 30 2009 	Expesive Dated and Noisy 2 bed Apartment	My family and I recently stayed in a 2 bed apartment at the Athenaeum. In short, the apartment we were allocated was situated directly above a very popular tapas bar (open 11.30am-midnight). The noise from below was very bad, and continued throughout the day, totally unsuitable for our young family (particularly our baby who was sleeping in the lounge area). Despite the promise of toys suitable for our children, a box of lego and 2 colouring books were provided for the first nights stay (we later requested a DVD which promptly arrived complete with popcorn). The 2 bed apartments are situated at the back of the hotel and have yet to be refurbished. The decor is dated, but the beds were comfortable. Upon arrival there was a small leak in one of the bathrooms which was quickly addressed. Unfortunately the same could not be said for the entry cards which continually did not work (we ended up needing 6 replacement cards for our 2 night stay).The kitchen was very handy and the inclusive mini bar a great idea (though it wasn't restocked during our stay). We ended up ordering breakfast in the room - arrived punctually, however, both mornings a couple of items were missing.On the whole, the staff were very pleasant, it was more the accommodation that was very disappointing. Certainly the 2 bed apartments are not suitable for anyone who has young children, or light sleepers. Needless to say, we won't be returning."
16,531,"Oct 26 2009 	Best hotel in London!	This is the best place I have ever stayed in when in London. The staff are fantastic and always able to help. The rooms were perfect and much larger than most London hotels, plus they are equipped with everything you could possibly need. The location is perfect for walking or catching the subway as Green Park station is right there. My friend and I had the most pleasant experience and i would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
17,531,"Oct 25 2009 	Unexpectedly luxurious up to date without too much minimalist decor	This is a boutique style hotel, newly refurbished so everything is pristine, lots of glass and light being used to good effect to create a sense of space. Well located about 2 mins walk to Green Park Station. Lovely comfortable rooms with every facility incl. an iPod dock, although not an LED clock somewhere in the room which would have been handy as I can't see my watch in the dark!. Luxurious if small bathroom with fluffy new white robes, (slippers delivered at turndown time), and great view onto Green Park and beyond. A special feature is the staff who are charming and helpful. Table d'hote dinner is good value, for London, with prices at 22 for 2 courses, 27 for 3. Breakfast is expensive but the quality was great. It was a pleasure to find a mini bar where soft drinks and snacks were not charged for at a hefty rate, being free. We liked the Whisky lounge with its mellow atmosphere for the evenings, and the Garden Room is a nice spot for afternoon tea (for which the hotel apparently has an award) and is not too feminine in decor, so we spotted quite a few men having tea there, unlike some other places where it has all got very frilly. We loved it and would happily return when we are staying in London again."
18,531,"Oct 23 2009 	The staff makes a stay at this boutique hotel very special	My three sisters and I had beautiful connecting rooms on the third floor overlooking Green park. The bay windows that opened with the juliet balconies were wonderful and we would sit having our tea or whiskies and watch the world whirl by. Shutting the windows cut the noise dramatically but we kept them cracked a bit to soak up the London sounds. The rooms were a good size with comfortable beds covered with fluffy duvets.The bathroom was larger than others I have had in London. Because we paid for these upgraded rooms we had free access to eveything in the mini bar, including alcohol. Everything was replenished daily. We loved the peppercorn crisps! The hotel has free wireless which was great.The staff of this hotel is what really makes the difference. From Jim and John, the doormen, to Saleem, who checked us in and then personally took us to our rooms, to the general manager and his staff who invited us to a cocktail reception and then made us feel very welcome.....this hotel made us feel very special.The location is perfect for seeing London. There are two tube stops nearby. You can cross the street and be at Buckingham Palace in 5 minutes. We had many restaurants within a couple blocks. We loved Pret a Manger for breakfast and stopped by several times. We had one breakfast in the hotel but we aren't really buffet brunch people no matter how elegant it is.I can't think of a negative thing to say about the Athenaeum. It will be the hotel we return to on our next trip to London."
19,531,"Oct 17 2009 	""Green"" Hotel in a Perfect Location	I was staying in the Athenaeum in September for two nights. I've been trying out hotels in London in the past few years, and I must say, this one is one of my favourites. Its location is very good, only five minutes from Green Park tube station and only a couple of minutes to Marble Arch Tube station.You instantly recognise the hotel by its landmark wall garden, which attracts butterflies in the day and is lit in a gloomy green at night. The staff is friendly and helpful, and although our room was located with its windows looking at the backyard, the rooms surpassed my expectations. The beds are fluffy, the minibar is complimentary (except for some alcoholic drinks) and the entertainment system is faboulus. The Athenaeum might become one of my &quot;safe harbours&quot; in London :)"
20,531,"Oct 12 2009 	lovely	My teenage daughter and i stayed here for four nights. Great location, very clean and well-appointed rooms, free mini-bar goodies, excellent espresso machine in the room. The service was good and they provided popcorn with free DVD's and milk and cookies in the evening. The location is right across from Green Park and only a few minutes from the Piccadilly Line tube, yet surprisingly quiet. The staff is very helpful. Our room was only one step up from the basic and it had a lovely bay window. The breakfast is over-priced but for a minute's walk you have many other choices. Great workout facilities and spa amenities."
21,531,"Oct 9 2009 	Fabulous Hotel!	If you want to treat yourself in London, stay here. It is expensive (on my salary), but worth it. The staff was excellent. They answered every question that I had and made reservations for a play and a bus tour. They had a maid in the morning and a maid that turned down the bed at night. (Nice touch.) You could have everything in the fridge for free (except for the liquor) and that was great. They had a tea kettle, a coffee thing (that I didn't understand) and various cups etc. We were in the back, so we didn't have any problem falling asleep.I found tiny flaws. I know that they just made over the rooms. And, I had a small room, as one would expect in London. But the mirrors! They were on one wall, the closet was mirrored, the bathroom door was mirrored, both sides. It would have been nice if I was size 2, but I am not. The other thing was the bathroom door didn't open all the way, so I had to wedge myself in. I had a hard time getting in the bathtub to take a shower. (I have a disability.) I asked the manager and had another manager show me a room that had a shower that you didn't have climb into. That was important and now I know what to ask before I make a reservation. All in all, if I had the money again, I would stay here again."
22,531,"Oct 9 2009 	Perfect location and beautiful decor though expensive!	I treated my husband to a night's stay at this hotel for a birthday present and booked it through the &quot;Secret Rooms&quot; on Laterooms.com. The hotel itself has the most perfect location being a five minute walk from Buckingham Palace and very close to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. It is easily accessible by tube (though tricky at weekend due to ongoing maintenance!) and car and occupies a plot opposite the beautiful Green Park.On arrival, we were greeted by the wonderfully friendly and caring staff who couldn't do enough for us. They made a huge fuss of our 6 month old baby which was especially good as many higher end hotels are not keen fans of babies! Our room was beautifully decorated with warm colours and quirky London features such as miniature soldiers in bearskins in a cabinet and a picture with many London landmarks. There was a Nespresso machine with a choice of coffee and all the soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar were free. Prior to arrival, we were sent a questionnaire asking us our favourite hobbies etc and when we arrived, they had put a Nintendo Wii with games in the room, as well as a DVD player and children's DVDs.My only criticism of the hotel is the food and beverages prices. It was 7.75 for a 50ml measure of gin and our two club sandwiches with chips and bottle of wine room service bill came to 60.00. Whilst I accept that London is expensive and 5* hotels are expensive, I cannot possible fathom how a sandwich can cost 15!!!Having said that, I would stay in the hotel again as the location was perfect and the staff were excellent. I just might take my own sandwiches next time!!!"
23,531,"Oct 8 2009 	Encore visit superb service elegant comfort the best staff!	A second visit for us to this hotel, we are a well traveled family of that frequents 4/5 star properties in the US. Upon arrival we were welcomed by the on staff mgr/kids' concierge who personally installed the Wii to my jet lagged kids' delight. The bell staff are world class and make each entrance and exit of your trip like you are leaving a friend's home. The accomodations are superb down from the comfortable bedding and the elegant restaurant, to the complementary stocked pantry with a stash of pleasant snacks and bottled water. There are a lot of high end options in London yet this distinguishes itself from the others in numerous ways that are important to the well-traveled. It is competitively priced."
24,531,Oct 6 2009 	SPA	Booked a Spa treatment at the hotel for myself and daughter. Wonderful location and very nice staff. Pleasant doorman - great all round.
25,531,"Oct 5 2009 	Lovely hotel individual and great service	This is a lovely hotel - the staff are full of personality and very helpful. The location is great, 2 minutes from Green Park tube and walking distance from Picadilly/REgents Street etc.we stayed in a room quite high up and it was small! In fact it was very small, and the double bed was also small. Got a good deal on Lastminute but - although well equipped, small room. BUT - lots of lovely freebies. REN toiletries, robes to use, slippers, everything non alcoholic in the mini bar was complimentary and well equipped room with great Ipod speakers, free wifi, well stocked fridge, state of the art lighting system and nice and quiet. Overall, I would return. I might try and get a bigger room but it was a good deal and I really liked the ambience. Bar is very nice and well stocked (if you like scotch whisky you're really in luck) but tiny! Menu looked good too. All in all cosy, stylish, friendly and well equipped."
26,531,"Oct 3 2009 	Truelly fantastic	Wonderful hotel. Great service. Now they can check even you in in the whisky bar. The card was already filled out, luggage disappeared to the room and able to get my emails because they don't charge you for wifi. This hotel is ahead of the game."
27,531,Sep 29 2009 	Wonderful Afternoon Tea	We had an absolutely wonderful afternoon tea at the Athenaeum - I had looked at the reviews online and saw that it had won an award this year.The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Would highly recommend!

Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments offer spacious luxury living with a family twistthink video game coffee tables, game boards, toy baskets and milk and cookies delivered to your room every night. Your kids will never want to go home! Occupying a row of Edwardian townhouses in a classic English neighborhood, the apartments offer plenty of room for the whole family to spread out as well as the convenience of a full kitchen, washer and dryer, dining area and more. This hotel offers parents top design and luxury while catering to kids of all ages offering a home away from home youve always wanted (if it werent for those pesky kids leaving all their toys everywhere) atmosphere!"
29,531,"Sep 24 2009 	Great service combined with a wonderful location	This gem of a hotel has one of the best people. From the bellhop to the receptionists, they were all very warm and welcoming to all their guests. I enjoyed the fact that the tall guy up front (it's too bad I didn't get his name but he is hard to miss...tall English man with white hair) always says &quot;Welcome home!&quot; with his deep voice and trademark smile whenever you get back to the hotel. He is my favorite guy there. The waiters in the restaurants were also kind enough to explain how the breakfast menu works (there were 2 types of breakfast available) and the different courses for lunch. The amount attention given to us was just right, they aim to please but are not over eager to do so. The big Marks and Spencers is just about .7 miles away (Oxford Street) while Harrods and Harvey Nichols would be approximately the same distance (.7 to .8 miles) but towards a different direction. The Original Sightseeing Tour buss has a stop across the street so this added to the convenience of this hotel's location. Numerous restaurants are within walking distance. The room and toilet were quite small but they were very clean. Other than the room size, there is really nothing to complain about. Another plus was that the internet was free."
30,531,Sep 7 2009 	Great hotel	Stayed for the weekend.Staff very friendly and helpful.The room was spacious and very comfortable and recently refurbished.The hotel location is great for getting around west london.Would definately stay again.
31,531,"Aug 18 2009 	great location comfortable stay	Check-in was welcoming but the orginial room I was assigned was not. It was at the back of the hotel, very dark, small with a disabled facilites bathroom. When I requested to change rooms, reception were great. They upgraded me to a better room on the side of the hotel which was much more spacious, comfortable and hospitable. Stayed there for 2 nights, the doorman was very friendly and helpful and I would recommend this hotel to those of you who are looking for a great location in the centre of london. PS- the complimentary soft drinks, snacks and proper coffee in the rooms was a refreshing change."
32,531,"Aug 18 2009 	Fabulously splendid luxury girly retreat	Having frequented the Athenaeum for a variety of occassions previously, I booked the Athenaeum expecting the warmth, generosity of staff and relaxed luxury that I have come to expect from this establishment. However I did know that the hotel has been slowly refurbishing over the past year and so hoped that the magical qualities that had  prescribed its quiet charm had not been disrupted. We were not disappointed. On entering the hotel for check in we were told that there would be a short ten minute wait for our room and were shown into the beautifully appointed hotel bar where we were served complimentary mango sorbet chocolate cones whilst we waited. It is hidden touches such as these that just serve to create the delightful ambience where you are consistantly surprised and provoke some very precious memories. After being shown up to our room by the receptionist we set our eyes on a fabulously quirky design that consisted of all the most dapper of British qualities- humour, eccentricity, glamour and complete style, an elegant setting for an elegant trip. Throughout our stay we could not have felt more welcomed by the staff who really do act as though they are just there to create every detail for your utter ease and also enjoyed some superb cocktails and wine in the beautiful bar. A higly recommended place to stay, thank you so much the Athenaeum!"
33,531,"Aug 17 2009 	Wonderful Service and Perfect Location	We stayed four nights in a 2BR/2BA apt (actually two one bedroom apartments opened up to connect). We had terrific service the entire time from all of the staff- -desk, door, bell, concierge, even when my temper flared over the DVD and airconditioning. This was clearly 5 star service. Any time we asked for ice, or anything, someone arrived very promptly. Ditto previous poster regarding location- -could not be better. I would also mention that the Shepherd's Square area of Mayfair is a three minute walk from the apartments and is a great place to grab a late breakfast or visit a pub. The rooms were nicely furnished and housekeeping was very good. Our apartment could have used a little fresh paint and carpet, and a microwave. Also, one side of our apartment had a strangely controlled air conditioning unit and I had to call for help with it. Later, I discovered a laminated card in the drawer of one of the tables that explained its use. I'm sure a previous occupant had put the card in a drawer. However, it was really handy to have the small washer/dryer unit in the kitchen, and the concierge had placed an XBOX in the unit for my son. We had plenty of space to spread out. The apartment felt like a home away from home. We had one breakfast in the hotel and it was fabulous, and quite expensive. The restaurant was very stylishly decorated and appeared to be very popular.I would definitely return and recommend it to anyone looking for an apartment, but also with the service of a fine hotel."
34,531,"Jul 21 2009 	Yet another enjoyable experience at the wonderful Athenaeum	I first had the pleasure of staying at the Athenaeum approx 4 years ago, and having stayed in numerous other establishments over the years I have found nowhere that comes close. From the moment you approach the main doors, either John or Jim are there to welcome you, in a manner that goes beyond simple politeness, the welcome feels as genuine as it possibly could be. Reception staff have at all times been polite, friendly and efficient. The rooms are always well presented and the recent refurbishment is testimony to the owners determination to keep this hotel at the top of its game. Unlike many hotels who let their rooms become worn and tired to the point that they almost scream &quot;refurb&quot; at you as you enter...I've yet to see a room that I would have considered in need of any works whatsoever, hence my suprise that works were being carried out throughout the establishment! My only gripe in the older rooms was the size of the bath, that now seems to be remedied and certainly feels more comfortable...not sure where the extra space has been stolen from though! The park view rooms feature floor to ceiling opening doors with views of....and from higher floors...over, Green Park and Piccadilly. Complementary soft drinks, mini bar snacks, tea, coffee and hot chocolate add to the experience, that whilst representing no &quot;great&quot; cost for any hotel, its just something that you don't normally see provided ...but do normally pay unreasonable charges for. Well done Athenaeum management for that little touch.The Whisky Bar has a warm and friendly ambience and is very welcoming after a late night. Its the only bar that I have seen the Arran Malt on sale, and as I refuse to open my own bottle of Founders Reserve for sentimental reasons, I get to sample it at the Athenaeum! Again, service is always polite and friendly.If I had to look for any faults, perhaps a cd player in the room, a tv with a sleep timer, less complex lighting (feels good once its sussed out) and the return of the Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel....but all very minor and really wouldn't stop me from recommending it to anyone....OH and there's always an adequate number of coat hangers and a working iron and often a copy of Time Out or a Whats On magazine in the rooms! Externally the addition of the living wall is something to behold and sets the Athenaeum apart as host to the first such wall in London!All great stuff and looking forward to the next visit.Glenn."
35,531,"Jul 14 2009	THE ATHENAEUM-Amazing London Apartment/hotel!	We have just returned from a wonderful family trip to London, Spain, France and Italy (I will write reviews for all of our &quot;finds&quot;! For the London portion of our trip, we stayed at The Athenaeum Hotel and Apartments. We are a family of five (three teens) along with my mother who met us in London for five days! LOCATION-Unbelievably perfect...located just down the street from The Ritz on Piccadilly! Cross the street from the hotel and you are in Green Park (we enjoyed a picnic dinner in the park on our last night!) Walk thru the park and you are standing right in front of Buckingham Palace! Cross the street (from the hotel) and walk less than a block and you are at Green Park Tube station! Look out one of your windows and see a picture perfect London street with a little church at the end! APPEARANCE-gorgeous, elegant Manhattan style apartment building (they also have a hotel at the front of the building). Beautiful flower boxes welcome you as you enter the oversized shiny black front door and foyer with an inlaid tile floor. The high ceilinged rooms that house the living room (w/a fireplace surrounded by an elegant mantel- (it was well into the 90's, so it was not used), bedroom, eating room, and bathrooms are traditionally decorated with gorgeous damask fabric curtains. The kitchen allowed us to shop at Mark and Spencer (great London grocery store about a block away) and prepare breakfasts and sometimes dinner on our own schedule. The washing machine came in handy as well! THE STAFF- they became dear family friends to our family! Serena, John, April, Emma, and Tom (and every other employee I may be forgetting) were the sweetest, most helpful people while we stayed in London. Our oldest celebrated his birthday while we were in London and Serena helped make it a special day for him! The Hard Rock Cafe is just down the street as well! Our kids are in love with London and look forward to returning...be it for pleasure, study or living!! All of us were a bit sad to leave our home away from home on our last day! I truly believe our children's love for London comes in part from their stay at the Athenaeum."
36,531,"Jul 9 2009 	Absolutely fantastic venue	I attended a business meeting here recently. From the very first enquiry, right through to when we left the Hotel, the service was second to none! The rooms we booked were exactly as described, if not better! I cannot rate The Athenaeum highly enough!All, and I mean ALL staff we encountered were the epitome of excellence."
37,531,"Jul 8 2009 	Great location; friendly 	We stayed for 3 nights in a 1 bedroom apartment. The service was wonderful - warm and helpful from the moment we walked into the lobby! Compared to the light-filled hotel rooms (which face Green Park) the apartments are a little dark as they face a narrow streetfront. However, they were very comfortable and spacious, and it was a lovely touch that there were books and toys for our young child in the apartment upon our arrival. The kitchenette was adequate for a few days' stay However, it could really do with a microwave, especially for families with young children who need to warm up milk several times a day and don't want to be standing over a stove. I learned later that the Athenaeum has a sister property of serviced apartments at 23 Greengarden House near Oxford Street which looks better equipped for longer stays, so I may well check that out next time. The location of the Athenaeum is pretty unbeatable though - walking distance to pretty much everywhere one would want to visit in central London, assuming the weather cooperates!"
38,531,"Jun 30 2009 	Great people in a nice location	We rented a 1-bedroom apartment within 24 hours notice. Quite spacious apartments in the heart of London in Mayfair - just a 5 minute walk from Green Park tube station. Diana and Serena in guest relations are simply superb.After having traveled for nearly 60 days in Europe over three trips, I have now a fairly decent sense of hotels and so even though I really like this hotel, I am rating it the way it is - my overall impression is favorable but specifics of the hotel left me wanting a bit. The wifi here also has some issues - serviced by a company called WiFiSpark - I sent them an email with issues (does not work on iphone and does not support facebook) and it took them only 7 days to write back to me.The price is high and perhaps the value is low. We decided to stay at the 196 Bishopsgate for the second half of our trip - I will post a review when the trip ends."
39,531,"Jun 27 2009 	Fantastic Hotel I loved every minute of my stay	The Athenaeum is one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. We were staying in a suite on the 7th floor, overlooking Green Park and it was simply divine. Our suite had everything ready and in perfect working order to make our stay comfortable and the staff were very efficient and helpful, going out of their way to make sure we were happy and well looked after. The bed was luxuriously comfortable, with soft, freshly washed linen and our suite also featured a walk in double shower in the bathroom, including a bath with a huge mirrored wall, which gave a sense of spaciousness. All the rooms in the suite were very large in comparrison to other London hotels and this made us feel very at home and comfortable during our stay.The room service is very quick and efficient and the food is delicious. After returning from a show rather late at night I was incredibly hungry so ordered up some food, it arrived to my room promptly and the dining staff were very helpful and professional. I would definitely stay at The Athenaeum again and am also considering booking my parents a weekend stay for their anniversary. A delightful hotel that is both exceedingly beautiful and up market, but also comfortable and homely, a real gem!!."
40,531,"Jun 20 2009 	Welcome home!	Welcome home. Thats the Athenaeums motto when you walk in the door. And, boy, do they life up to that statement. This really does become your HOME while in London. I struck up conversations with most of the doormen, who were all top-notch. They would see me walking from a far and wave. There was also EXCELLENT service everywhere else as well. The front desk man who checked me in and escorted me to my room would see me occasionally during my stay and approach me, call me by name, and ask me if everything was OK. Do you need anything? And the politeness and courtesy never seemed forced or pressured. It seemed like they really, genuinely cared about my needs and my experience at their hotel. The room was large and very comfy. And the soft drinks, water, and snacks in the mini bar were all complementarysomething I have NEVER, EVER seen in London before. Would I say here again? In a heartbeat. Welcome home is right!"
41,531,"Jun 15 2009 	Fantastic stay can't wait to go back.	We wanted a reasonably priced stay because we were going to dinner at Claridges and booked direct with the hotel because they were offering the same price as Laterooms.com. I mentioned it was my husband's 40th birthday and didn't think anymore of it. They greeted us warmly and then mentioned that they had upgraded us free of charge which was a pleasant surprise. Checking in was super quick and the lady then gave us a quick guided tour of the hotel's facilities then showed us to our lovely bedroom. Soft drinks and snacks were free and there was also a coffee machine (and tea/coffee making facilities) with fresh milk in the fridge. So many little thoughful extras that will make us want to go back! The hotel has undergone a major refurbishment and it's gorgeous. The attention to detail is brilliant, my husband went home wanting to change everything in our house. We have stayed in many hotels in London and throughout the country and this is the first time we have bothered to review one. The service was excellent and basically we could not fault our stay."
42,531,"Jun 12 2009 	Wonderful Experience	My husband had business in London and naturally I came along. It's the 3rd time we have stayed here and it was the best! The rooms are large and well appointed. The service is amazing and the hotel is sparkling clean. Everyone is cordial and beyond helpful. I want to give a shout out to Jim and John at the door, John behind the front desk, Darren and Duncan were great as concierges and the siblings from Brazil in the dining room for breakfast each moring made my meal extremely enjoyable! What can I say/ I can't wait to come back. I adore London and staying at the Atheneum is one of the reasons."
43,531,"Jun 5 2009 	Beautiful friendly and individual facilities and service - highly recommend	I booked the Athenaeum as a Last Minute top secret hotel (I wanted to try something different), so I literelly didn't know what to expect. I was so, so pleasantly surprised. The location is central and convenient for pretty much anything in central London. But the facilities and staff themselves are what make the place so fantastic. My room was so well-decorated that I'm actually considering stealing some of their ideas. When I checked in, they informed me that all the soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar were complimentary (and they really didn't charge me for them!), and their whisky selection and the bar is really amazing (the choice and service all-round is great). I didn't get to use their spa/sauna/steam room facilities, but extrapolating judgement from other areas I'd expect them to be great. The best part was, I booked the hotel for my husband's birthday, and looked totally awesome for doing so. I definitely plan to go back again."
44,531,"Jun 3 2009 	Awesome in every way!	We were lucky enough to enjoy 3 nights at the Athenaeum Apartments and enjoyed every aspect of this boutique hotel &amp; apartments, the location is premium, opp. Green Park, a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Piccadilly &amp; Regent streets, Soho and everything London has to offer.Our apartment was one of the older ones,with 2 bedrooms, but still great, as it was full of character, well equipped &amp; fridge stocked with freebies, as well as a good array of free snacks refilled every day. Our friends had a 3 bed room apartment, this would be good value if you had 3 couples sharing &amp; split the cost, each apartment had a roomy lounge as well."
45,531,"May 28 2009 	Would definitely return but not to the same room.	This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location. Unfortunately, we only stayed one evening which our daughter had booked through an internet site, so I've no idea of the cost. We were celebrating a joint birthday and anniversary and as such our stay was viewed as a treat. Unfortunately, and as mentioned, our initial impression was overshadowed by the scaffolding to the front and rear of the hotel. But no sooner had we emerged from the taxi, when an attentative doorman opened the door for us - a most welcome gesture and typical of a top hotel. The booking in was efficient and fast, although the site that my daughter had booked it through was mentioned, which we couldn't understand the reason for, unless it was just to clarify the confirmation? Unlike others, we weren't offered an upgrade but this might have been because the rooms were booked at a discounted rate due to the renovations that were taking place.A lovely gentleman whipped our suitcases away and deposited them in our rooms, and they'd kindly allocated a room next door for our daughter.. Unfortunately, the scaffolding work (which I've since noticed seems to have been removed from the front) came up to our bedroom windows, which were situated at the rear, but there was no problem with any noise - just a barely-existent view of a courtyard below. However, we were there to see a show and have a small celebration, so didn't intend doing more than just sleep and bathe etc.As our stay was so short, we didn't have time to make use of the hotels excellent facilities, nor did we have breakfast there. The rooms we were allocated were slightly on the tired side for the star rating, and they weren't rooms that you'd have wanted to stay in for too long, but again, that was probably due to the renovations. The rooms were of a generous size by London standards, and as expected, clean and comfortable, The bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries, and immaculate. The communal areas were immaculate also, but time was so limited we didn't even have time to wander around this excellent hotel.Our short stay was enhanced by the excellent and friendly staff who couldn't be faulted, and we'd definitely stay again, but only if we paid more for an upgraded room. Would recommend this hotel to friends and family once the renovations are completed, as I'm sure that no-one would be disappointed by this well-located and up-market establishment."
46,531,"May 27 2009 	The best place I've ever stayed!	Like many reviewers I booked this as a top secret hotel on last minute.com we stayed the weekend of my boyfriends birthday. We didn't get any birthday cards or uogrades, but even without either of these it was still an amazing hotel! I've never stayed in a hotel where the receptionist leads you to your room, so that felt a nice touch!The room was huge and well maintained. There are only two things I could complain about (if nit picking) one was that the central controls for the room were too easy to turn off all the lights. The other was the lemony fragrance pumped through the air con day and night which i could almost taste in the morning. Aside from this the stay was amazing and I'd definitely go back (if I could get the same price again, however it seems to be a lot more now than when I stayed so it doesn't look likely to happen soon.)"
47,531,"May 24 2009 	Good location but more like a 4 star	The location near Green Park tube is fantastic - three tube lines go through here, as well as plenty of nearby buses. Size of room not bad for London, quite comfortable - beds were nice. There was no view from my room , it was a quiet room but it looked out on a brick wall of the neighbouring building. Bathroom was small but has nice soap &amp; shower gel etc. The hotel was being renovated which is probably why I got a good rate on lastminute.com. Overall not bad, but probably not 5 star standard - felt more like a 4 star."
48,531,"May 18 2009 	top hotel	me and my wife booked it for our birthday what can i say top staff great room clean stylish, location is perfect we loved it and would be there again very soon i recomend this place to all"
49,531,"May 7 2009 	Great hotel freindly staff	My fiance booked this hotel for my 30th Birthday. It was not cheap but I think it was worth every penny.When we arrived we were quickly checked in and shown to our room by the freindly receptionist. As requested we had a smoking room which was not expected. As it was my 30th birthday the hotel had arranged a complementary upgrade which included a bottle of wine and a gift. The room was big and comfortable. The only downside to the accomadation was that the bath was very small although the shower was powerfull. The room came equipt with a large flat screen TV a Bose i-pod dock and a coffee machine. Also included were bath robes and slippers which was a nice touch. I didn't try out the spa facilities, but they looked good.Overall this was a fantastic luxury place to stay and I really felt pampered. We didn't eat breakfast here as it was 24 per person, instead we went to Harry's bar just down the road for a great value very tasty breakfast which I would highly recconmend. I would stay here again as is in a great location very comfortable and a real treat."
50,531,"Apr 30 2009 	Awful service !!!	I had the most awful experience I've ever had at any hotel I've stayed at during my stay at the Athenaeum Hotel in March. I found many of the concierge to be unfriendly and the service to be of a consistently low-standard, especially reservationist Myriam who was pretty unpleasant and unhappy when I was asking questions and an indian guy showing no respect for other people. How Awful!?!Moreover, I did my drycleaning there and had to return a pair of pants three times, and another shirt twice, before stains were removed that I had pointed out each time. Room are very tiny.This was a disappointing stay and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
51,531,"Apr 24 2009 	Very very nice indeed!	Not really sure why some people are not happy with this place as the rooms and public areas are the cleanest of any hotel I have ever stayed at in London and I've stayed in many! Yes the breakfast is not cheap at 27.50 (most rates include it anyway) and the minibar is way overpriced (there's a minimarket on the adjacent street just a minutes walk away), but everyhting else was absolutely top notch and the staff are just so, so friendly. Overall a great clean bill of health."
52,531,Apr 21 2009 	good location smart hotel attentive staff	Arrived and made welcome quick check in and room good. breakfast expensive as were bar drinks.
53,531,"Apr 21 2009 	Expected a lot more for my money poky tatty room - disappointed	I chose this hotel for a relaxing indulgent weekend away by myself, and treated myself to what I thought would be five star luxury, based on the website. The location was great, but my room was really a big let down. It was so small and cramped in there, the furniture was tatty, the bath was not full size. I've stayed in many better hotel rooms (pretty much any in the US have beaten it for size and quality of decor/fittings). It felt like a budget room, but it was very far from being a budget price. Aside from that, the room service was very good and prompt; breakfast was good, though I had to wait a long while as it was too busy to get a table on the Sunday morning, which seemed a bit poor. Front of house seemed a bit cramped (in comparison to other places I've stayed) - not very much of a wow factor. I was unable to get the treatments I required at the health spa as they were overbooked, but after making a fuss, was offered the option to have a massage and pedicure in my room (getting the foldaway table in my room was quite a struggle, and once it was erected the therapist couldn't move around it very well, so it was all a bit comical and not quite the relaxing experience I'd hoped for). I paid top whack for the single room I had (which had a small double bed). I'm off to London again soon and have chosen a different hotel - very little about the Athenaeum would entice me back."
54,531,"Apr 3 2009 	Not 5 star standard but good food	Husband and I stayed here for one night last March- having a much needed night off from our 3 month old baby. We live in London and wanted to stay in a nice hotel centrally and just have a little break from the rigours of having a new baby. We booked this because it was 5 stars and we got a good deal on last minute dot com.We were disappointed by the quality- we expected more for 5 stars. Our room was tiny and not particularly luxurious- it was high up and had a partial view of the park though. It was next to the lift shaft and there was constant noise from that so we asked to be moved which they did very promptly. We were moved to a lower floor and I imagine a more expensive room as the nextr room was very big indeed but again, same standard of decor etc.The bathroom was standard fare- marble counter tops etc, but the toiletries were awful, synthetic not at all luxurious, not 5 star.We ate in the restaurant which has had a makeover and is a lovely, warm space- approached through a really cosy bar area. It is perfect for a romantic meal- all shades of pink and gold and the tables are not too close together. The food was excellent and good value.I would recommend the Athenaeum if you can get a deal on the internet but otherwise there are definitely better 5 star options in central london- the Dorchester being one or the Churchill on portman Square which is a fantastic place with luxury rooms and a great breakfast."
55,531,"Apr 1 2009 	Good location great staff	Really enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel. The standard rooms are as small as one would expect for a city central hotel room, but the staff were so welcoming and helpful that I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Makes a world of difference when you get a sense of genuine hospitality."
56,531,"Mar 17 2009 	Great hotel and great location!	I stayed here for a night whilst catching up with friends in London. Booked through a well known late availability site and was very impressed with the hotel! I usually stay at the Cavendish on Jermyn St but decided to try the Athenaeum because my parents had stayed here and said it was nice. On arrival I was greeted by a very friendly and polite doorman and then an equally friendly and polite chap on reception (I think his name was Jonathan). He could not have been more helpful and also told me that I had been given an upgraded room (room 803 if anyone's interested!). The room was fantastic - I had a view across Green Park - and was spacious and spotlessly clean. Nicely furnished and even had a very swanky coffee machine, CD player and a minibar with complimentary chocolate, nuts, crisps and soft drinks which was a nice touch. I'm guessing this would be an Executive Room and they just upgraded me because they had the availability to do so - it was nice that they did. The bathroom was very nice with a powerful shower and plenty of fluffy towels. The location is perfect - just a short walk from Green Park tube and close to Buckingham Palace, Fortnum &amp; Mason and a wealth of shops on Piccadilly and Regent St. Also just a 10-15 minute walk from Leicester Square. There are also lots of great restaurants nearby including the very nice Shepherd Market area just a few steps away. I would emphasise that I was lucky enough given an upgraded room whilst when my parents were staying they had a standard room - however they had absolutely no complaints with it at all. I don't think they had a park view but other than that they were very happy with it. I found all the staff to be really friendly and helpful and there definitely was no &quot;big hotel&quot; indifference. They really seem to care about making sure guests have a nice stay. For the quality of accomodation and price paid I felt that the Athenaeum was extremely good value and I would definitely recommend it and stay there again."
57,531,"Mar 15 2009 	Incredible staff wonderful Hotel	My husband &amp; I just had a lovely 40th Wedding Anniversary Weekend at The Athenaeum Hotel, the staff were the so friendly &amp; helpful. Special thanks to Diane who organized for our room to be upgraded. We will be returning very soon, thank you so much for making it so special."
58,531,"Mar 11 2009 	Hypnos Beds Fantastic Breakfasts and Super Friendly staff	This is our fifth visit to the Athenaeum in the last three years. The hotel is currently shrouded in scafflding while exterior work is being done. Finished soon. Usually a bad sign. Not here. We were shown to our room by a bubbly front desk girl who clearly loved her job. The room was recently renovated and spotless. They had maintaned the lovely marble bathrooms, but put in new large flat screen tv's.After two nights on the luxurious mattress my wife looked to see what kind it wa and voila, a Hypnos bed. This is a bedmaker to the Queen and is particularly good if like me you have allergies to dust mites. At home I wake up every morning feeling stuffed up, here no such problem. Great timing for us as we were considering buying just such a bed, but wanted to be sure it was worth the high price. Now thanks to Athenaeum we can go ahead and purchase in complete confidence. What a fantastic side benefit from returning to this hotel. Breakfasts are served in a modern smart restaurant and is excellent and varied. All staff from front desk, concierge, bellman, and restaurant staff really do seem to love their jobs. We have seen most of them on repeat visits, and I think that too is a good sign.I just hope my glowing review does not do too much to make this hotel much more popular (selfish I know)."
59,531,"Mar 9 2009 	Not worth the money friendly service	Booked this through lastminute as many ppl have recently as a birthday trip for me and bf.We actually walked past the hotel a few times as we couldn't find it through all the refurbishment works going on outside.We were in the apartments down the way and so had a lovely view of an office block and had workers watching us.The room was a twin, and when the receptionist showed us to the room she commented that oh dear, this is a twin - we'll have it made as a double - and the beds were just pushed together. It was not comfortable.The thermostat was set at 32c when we got there -so we had to put the aircon on, which was so noisy all night!There was some filthy insect in the sink (i think it was a silverfish) in the morning.The longlife milk in the frisge was out of date so no tea in the morning.Appauling considering it is a 5 star hotel."
60,531,"Mar 8 2009 	Uniquely designed rooms a pleasure.	The rooms and public areas of the hotel are fairly plush with well designed and luxurious features. We only stayed one night before flying overseas but we took the opportunity to go out in the west end. It is a fairly easy walk into Piccadilly Circus and Soho, passing St James' Park and Buckingham Palace (opposite the hotel), but there is a bus stop right outside that will take you into the heart of things in less than five minutes should you feel inclined.The only down side was that we would have been willing to raid the minibar as we were, ahem, thirsty and definitely starving but the prices were off the wall. Why do hotels have to charge five quid for a kitkat?"
61,531,Mar 6 2009 	It just gets better	This is the second time we have stayed here and it just gets better. Because of the building work we were upgraded to apartment 13 which was stunning. All the staff are so welcoming and freindly. The whole place has such a lovely feel to it unlike a lot of the other 5 star hotels in London. We will definately be staying here again.
62,531,"Jan 29 2009 	Brillian birthday	Had a brilliant stay here to celebrate my Wife's 30th birthday.Because of the building work being done to the front of the building the lovely woman on reception upgraded us to an apartment! Needless to say it was out of this world. Grand, charming, spacious and clean.We couldn't get over how attentive the staff we. They would bend over backwards for us and we felt well and truly looked after.I'm sure once the renevation work is complete the Executive rooms at the front would have been more than adequate.The spa was also top draw. Not exactly massive but the steam room was very powerful and the jaquzzi is well worth a visit.Will definately be coming back!!"
63,531,"Dec 27 2008 	Friendly hotel excellent staff!	My boyfriend and I have just returned home after spending a week at the Athenaeum Hotel in London. Our stay there was excellent and the staff all amazing! We were treated like special guests and every member of the staff were paying real attention to us and whatever we needed. We had booked through our agent in Greece a standard double room but we were upgraded to a &quot;Green Park view&quot; one as soon as we checked in. The room was newly refurbished with nice furniture and fresh colours. Everything was brand new and in excellent condition. Our view was a bit obstructed by a scaffold (renovation going on) but this won't last for long I believe. The restaurant and bar were great too. Everyone was polite and eager to offer their services. Even the beauty salon was great too!Selim at the reception is the sweetest and friendliest guy we' ve ever met at a 5* hotel - and we travel a lot, usually staying at hotels like Hilton or Sheraton. The location at Piccadilly is extremely convenient. Not more than 15 minutes walk to Oxford st., Knightsbridge, right next to Park Lane and Hyde Park.I'm very glad we selected this hotel and we're definitely going back. It feels as if we made new friends in London!"
64,531,"Dec 26 2008 	Not worth the price	My work Christmas party was taking place close to the hotel and as Lastminute.com had a wonderful deal for this hotel I thought I would take advantage of it.We were not informed about building work taking place in the hotel so were disappointed that the view of Green Park was replaced by plastic sheeting. I also did not expect to come out of the bathroom wearing just a towel to find 3 work men stood right outside my window.In the morning when we really needed to sleep off the party excesses drilling started at around 9.30 so we were unable to rest.In addition I don't actually think this hotel is worth the discounted rate that I paid for it let alone the full price. The bedroom was on the small side, the tv had a mind of it's own, the bath was so small I sat in in with my legs bent plus there wasn't a great deal of hot water.There are far better hotels in London for a fraction of the price."
65,531,"Dec 15 2008 	Worst 5* Hotel We've Ever Had The Displeasure Of Staying In!	This was supposed to be a great weekend getaway for my wife and myself, and well, considering that we spent good money on this hotel, to say that we were disappointed to say the least is an understatement!The best thing about the Athenaeum hotel is the door man, Jim, this man is a real gentleman, and is a shining example of what a door man should be. If it wasn't for him, I doubt that we would have spent the night. He treated my wife and myself, like we were made of gold, it was amazing!On to the hotel room though,when we checked in, we were informed that we had been upgraded from a normal room to a newly refurbished executive room, which we thought was great news.However once we got to the room we found long black hairs in the bath, and in the bed, considering both my wife and myself are blond, we knew they weren't ours, this was already a bit disturbing. Also, I found stains on my pillowcase, this is not the type of cleanliness that I expected from a 5 star hotel in the centre of London. The cupboard door wouldn't close properly either, so this was just plain annoying, especially considering that this was a recently refurbished executive room. One of the other issues that we had with the room was that the little porcelain cover on top of the cold tap labelled &quot;Cold&quot; was chipped and kept falling into the sink, and the underside of the sink was filthy as well.There were also renovations going on at the hotel and this was never mentioned when we booked at all, and well as for the timeless &quot;Green Park views&quot; that were advertised, well these are ruined by all the renovation work that is going on at the moment, so when you look out of your window, all you can see is scaffolding and red netting, not very timeless at all. I also phoned downstairs on the Sunday morning to get a bag retrieved from my car and brought to my room, I was told that this would be with me in 15 minutes time. Well, 15 minutes came and went, and I even phoned and said that we were going to have some breakfast, and then I would pick the bag up from reception. After breakfast, I went to the reception desk, only to be told that the receptionist went to the wrong persons car, adn couldn't find the bag, and then couldn't remember who we were or which room we were in.It seems that others have had great experiences at this hotel, but ours was atrocious, and we will never be going back to this hotel again. I honestly wonder how this hotel received above 3 stars! To be honest, I've always had great luck with Last Minute, but on this occasion I feel honestly let down, and feel like we wasted close to 200 on this occasion. I feel that Last Minute should at least update their listing to reflect that there are renovations going on at present."
66,531,Nov 17 2008 	Amazing!	I stayed at this hotel for my boyfriend's 30th birthday and found the hotel staff to be fantastic and the hotel itself wonderful. I had contacted the hotel prior to our visit to pay for a room upgrade and champagne for his birthday. When we arrived the hotel had upgradeed us to an amazing suite and even had a birthday card there waiting for him. The apartment was fantastic and the staff were ever so friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the experience was fantastic.
67,531,"Nov 6 2008 	Great place to stay in London	We stayed in one of the Apartments attached to the Hotel with our 2 small children, plus had a single in the Hotel for my mother-in-law. Fantastic place to stay in London - we'll never stay anywhere else in the future. Loved having a kitchen to fix breakfasts and coffees - several times we went to a local store and brought home prepared foods to heat up in the kitchen. It was all the benefits of having an apartment, but you also get the fantastic doorman to hail a taxi or help with luggage. Awesome stay in London - I recommend it highly."
68,531,"Oct 31 2008 	Amazing brilliant staff beautiful place	I booked this as a 'top secret' hotel through Last Minute. Within half an hour of making the booking one of the team from the hotel had called to see if there was anything extra I'd like, if it was for an occassion etc. It was a wedding anniversary so I told them this but declined the extras (50 for a bottle of champagne was more than I could manage).When we got there the hotel exterior was being worked on, but there was no noise. When we checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded to an apartment and were shown to the most beautiful place, with a lounge, kitchenette, diner and huge bedroom beautifully decorated and furnished. The staff member who showed us in was genuinely keen to make sure we were happy and it seemed to make her happy that I was so pleased - a rare thing in hotels I find. There was a card and wine, really nice little touches that meant everything.All the staff were helpful, polite and not condescending (something I find very frequently in London hotels) and keen to ensure that we were enjoying ourself and had what we needed etc. They even reminded us about the clocks changing!And the cocktails were fabulous... I would love to go back, and maybe try the restaurant.I think this is my new favourite hotel!"
69,531,"Oct 27 2008 	Fantastic	I have just returned from a weekend break in London for my husbands 30th birthday. I had booked the hotel as one of the 'last minute.com' mystery 5* hotels as I wanted to be near the west end. Once the hotel was confirmed I sent them an email upgrading from the standard double room to an executive room for an extra cost of 30 (making nightly tariff 150). On arrival we were informed that they had upgraded us to a one bedroom apartment free of charge. These are situated to the back of the hotel and have there own private entrances. We stayed in apartment 17 (house 3) and was impressed by the size, cleanliness, and quality of it. Ideal if we had been staying for longer than the one night, but as it happened the facilities were not required for a brief visit (although much appreciated and enjoyed)! The hotel had placed a birthday card for my husband in the room, which was a nice personal touch.We ate in the hotels restaurant (Damask) and the food was lovely, staff were fantastic, and once again effort was made by the staff to celebrate my husbands birthday by writing happy birthday in chocolate around the dessert plate (thankfully, no candles or singing!). The price in the restaurant is very reasonable costing 26 pp for 3 course meal and glass of champagne. Only criticism would be limited availability for room service after 11pm (mostly sandwiches or few hot food choices), but if you are lucky enough to stay in an apartment you could stock up for any late night snacks! Overall, the staff were very professional and friendly, and the hotel and communal areas were impeccable. Directly opposite the palace and a short walk from west end. Perfect location and I would recommend it to anyone. Don't be put off by the scaffolding at the front of the hotel, during the weekend we didn't see one workman or hear any maintenance."
70,531,"Oct 26 2008 	Perfections!	I booked the Athenaeum for my 3rd year anniversary. We arrived early to use the spa facilities and were told our room was ready even though it wasn't check in time. The people behind reception were very helpful and one man kindly showed us to our room. When we got to our room I was just blown away. They had upgraded us to an apartment because I had mentioned it was our anniversary. Later on they amazed us further by bringing complimentary wine, fruit and nuts to our room along with an anniversary card. How thoughtful. We had afternoon tea in the garden room that day and the service was wonderful. Everyone was so attentive and it was great value for money. We will certainly be going back as it was a truly special weekend."
71,531,"Oct 23 2008 	Fabulous Honeymoon stay	My husband and I just spent two very romantic nights at the Athenaeum. The staff went above and beyond in trying to help make our last two nights special. Upon check in, the girls behind the desk were warm, friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious, clean and tastefully decorated. After watching the most fabaulous musical we have every seen (Billy Elliott) we went back to our room to find candles, chocolates, chilled champagne and rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bed. I mean, WOW. It was a wonderful surprise and very much appreciated by us!!We have stayed here most every time we've visited London and we will continue to be loyal guests. Why look further? The service is spectacular!Thank you Athenaeum!!"
72,531,"Oct 21 2008 	Excellent Room Service	The hotel was a pleasant surprise, even taking account of the previous comments. Welcome good. Room good (despite being without a view and not being upgraded like many previous reviewers). Radio has a good selection of channels. Handy location - short walk to Green Park underground, shepherd's market, Hyde Park. The size and position of the bath have something to be desired - I presume things like this are being rectified in the works underway in the hotel. Can't comment on the restaurant as we did not eat in (although the hotel didn't push the restaurant for an evening meal). Also we took advantage of room service to have an excellent breakfast delivered to our room. It is worth taking the advice of an earlier reviewer and booking through a travel website. Luckily I read that after investigating the cost of B&amp;B direct from the hotel, which would have been significantly more expensive compared to the same offer through a website. This was a little surprising to find out as experience tends to show the opposite. Needless to say we booked through the web and saved some 60 on the deal."
73,531,"Oct 20 2008 	Very Enjoyable Stay	We stay in London quite regularly and normally stay at one of the Hiltons but, having recently lost the privileges we had from having a Hilton Honours gold card, we no longer see the Hilton chain as being such an attractive proposition so we have been trying out a number of the other 5 star hotels this year such as The Langham, the Raddisons, The Howard and The Ritz.etc.This stay (Oct 08) was a last minute decision and we booked using points obtained through our credit card and the booking was made through EBookers and included a standard room and continental breakfast.We arrived outside in a taxi (a little disturbed to see the entire exterior covered in scaffolding and sheeting which we were unaware of) but the taxi door was opened and our bags whisked away. We arrived about an hour before official check in time but this was not a problem. Reception staff were amongst the most efficient and friendliest that we have come across in London. We were advised that we had an upgrade to an executive room and the room was almost ready and they called through to house keeping to give our room priority. Meanwhile, after completing the usual paperwork, we were asked if she could help us with any lunch or dinner arrangements and we explained that we had already booked lunch at their restaurant for 2pm so she went straight to the Maitre D to re-confirm and also let her have our room number. She then escorted us to show us where the lounge, bar and restaurant and spa areas were before escorting us right to our room.The room was of a very nice size, in good order and with lots of character  very traditional in style and dcor and great curtains (no light seeping through in the morning). There was scaffolding outside the window but no walkways so privacy was not an issue. Our room overlooked the side street with a side view onto Green Park. There was a table and two chairs (some nice nuts and seeds and complementary bottled water on the table), a mini bar, complementary tea and coffee (with carton milk in the fridge), nice toiletries, dressing gowns, DVD player, good quality TV and quite a small but beautifully presented marble bathroom with heated mirrors (although this did mean it got very hot in there if you left the lights on).If anything, my only criticism would be that there were too many mirrors (all along one wall adjacent to the bed were mirrored doors and two walls of the bathroom)  just a personal thing, but I prefer not to see myself from all those angles!!We had lunch in their restaurant which was booked through Top Table (lunch 3 course inc coffee and truffles and a glass of champagne for 21 each). We loved the restaurant itself  quirky in dcor and quite buzzy in there when we first arrived. The service was good too. We opted for the buffet starter which was good (although probably better if you go earlier in the lunch sitting rather than very late as we did) and this consisted of a selection of cold starters including seafood and meats, salads etc. We then both chose the duck and game main course but they only had one available so they offered the same but cooked with just venison. It may have been due to the lateness of eating but I found the duck and venison a little over-cooked  no sign of pink at all and the sauce it was served in was a bit gloopy  that said, we both ate it all and still enjoyed it  it just could have been a little better. For dessert we both opted for crme caramel which was good. Coffee and truffles were also lovely. All in all  this came to just over 100 + service so we thought it was excellent value for money considering more than half of that was the bottle of Taittinger we ordered.We ordered room service breakfast in the morning and this was delivered promptly and had lovely fresh pastries and excellent hot chocolate (although we did not eat too much as had lunch booked for later) and there was no tray charge for the room service breakfast.All in all we really enjoyed our stay here. The location is not as good for us as other hotels we have stayed in as it was really too far to walk to Covent Garden etc but the surrounding area is very nice. The service we received throughout our stay was truly 5 star, the rooms were lovely and comfortable (although the bed was a little hard for us), the restaurant is excellent value for money and a big issue for us personally is that they did not add compulsory service charges to everything  no tray charges for room service or anything  gratuities were clearly at your own discretion and complementary bottled water  I always begrudge paying extra for this in a five star hotel. I am sure we will return."
74,531,"Oct 1 2008 	Wonderful!	We booked the &quot;Christmas in London&quot; tour from Maupintour and we stayed at this hotel. It was first class all the way - from the bellman to the desk staff. We stayed in the apartments and they were beautifully decorated with antiques as well as contemporary (as in, plasma televisions in both the living room and bedroom). The only complaint we had was the coffee pot and the washer/dryer. We couldn't quite figure them out...but then I'm sure the staff would've been more than happy to assist, if we had made use of them.The hotel is within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Picadilly Circus and a short bus ride to Oxford Street. Location is perfect. The restaurant staff was beyond expectations - they addressed us by name each time we saw them. They have had top notch customer service training.The food in the restaurant was delicious; we particularly loved the fresh fruit offered at breakfast.We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it, if price is not a huge issue."
75,531,Sep 29 2008 	We felt like royality	We have just returned from 1 night stay in the 5* Athenaeum and it was perfect bliss. On arrival we were upgraded to an apartment. From arriving the service was brilliant from every member of staff. Our bags and coats were taken to our apartment and our car was parked and returned for us(parking cost 30pn). It was a total surprise for my 40th!! and my husband had booked a side by side (his n hers) back massage and facial. The girls were extremely professional and experienced and we felt totally relaxed afterwards. The spa facilities are compact but adequate and everything you need. Unhappy we have left and returned to normality. We would just like to say a big thankyou to you all and we hope to see you soon xx
76,531,"Sep 23 2008 	Location location location!!!	I had a wonderful 2 nights here just after Christmas '07 for a very special occasion (proposed to my now wife)! The staff were very professional. Door staff were particularly friendly. The very helpful guy at concierge even managed to get us a last minute table at an apparently very exclusive restaurant after calling pretty much everywhere and he didn't show a hint of disappointment when I suddenly cancelled his efforts at the very last moment as I instead, rather impulsively, opted to pop the big question in the middle of Green Park that night... very romantic place by the way, with Buckingham Palace, The Ritz and even Big Ben all lit-up and surrounding the peaceful, old-style-lampost-ridden green expanse!The room (park view, overlooking said Green Park, or to be honest, the main road in front of the hotel with reasonable Green Park view beyond... well my room was only on the 3rd floor) was on the small side, but I guess that's par for the course in London!I remember having to request simple things like shaver and toothbrush which I couldn't believe were not supplied as standard in such a pricey establishment, but the house staff were extremely prompt in meeting my needs, once requested.Enjoyed an amazing room service dinner. Highly recommended!The restaurant itself was a bit on the &quot;cozy&quot; side (quite small and intimate), but the food and service were very good.Overall, a very pleasant and well-run hotel, but it wasn't the exceptional, 5 star luxury that I had imagined (maybe my expectations were unrealistic for a London hotel and I was unfairly measuring my hopes against other hotels I've stayed at in other countries such as Japan for example)!I guess no matter where you choose in London, the majority of your hard-earned cash will go on the actual LOCATION of the venue and not the extra fringe benefits associated with other establishments of the same level in other cities. And with that said, I'd have to give this place full marks as you really couldn't wish for a better location in London... easy walking distance (for a healthy thirty-something anyway) to all the main sites such as Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, Buckingham Palace, all the way to Trafalgar Square, Big Ben and the London Eye (we never used any transport other than our feet the whole time there)!Probably won't stay there again, but that's no reflection on the hotel. I just want to try one of the other top-end hotels in the same area the next time I'm in town (which might not be for another few years anyway)! This hotel=great. The location=perfect!"
77,531,"Sep 19 2008 	Firm Favourite!	Hi,I'm new to tripadvisor but thought I had to write a review of the Athenaeum. My boyfriend and I stay here on average once a year, sometimes more. It's definitely our hotel of choice whenever we're in London.It's location is perfect, so close to Buckingham Palace and The Ritz, and it's right on the Piccadilly line so getting to other touristy spots like Covent Garden and Leicester Square are really easy.The rooms are always beautiful. The first time we went we were upgraded to an apartment, (because we asked for twin beds to be put together) which was out of this world. More flat screen tv's than we knew what to do with and living areas that were bigger than what we had at home! My brother and his girlfriend were also upgraded to an apartment, just because there was a glitch in processing their payment. Rest assured if you are made to feel even a little put out the Athenaeum will go out of their way to make it up to you.The last time we stayed (Feb 2008) we were upgraded to a park view suite, which I actually preferred to the apartments due to it's amazing view of the Park, with the London Eye slowly moving in the background.The food and wine is as good, but as pricey, as you'd expect but it's so close to the centre of London you never really have to stay in. The hotel may look expensive at first, but if you shop around you can usually find really good online deals."
78,531,Sep 17 2008 	Absolutely Perfect	We booked this through lastminute.com as a Top Secret Hotel so were not sure what we would get. To say that we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement. It was fabulous. The Athenaeum has a boutique feel to it and the room was perfect. It is apparently being updated but we neither saw nor heard any sign of this and apart from the odd stain on the carpet I would not have noticed that it was in need of updating. We arrived early at 11.30 am and expected to just leave our bags until we could check in but they changed our room so that we could check in straight away which was wonderful. The only down side is that we were only there one night so didn't have the chance to fully appreciate it. The location is wonderful and despite being on Piccadilly we could hear no traffic noise from our room at the back of the hotel. All of the staff we met were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there again.
79,531,"Aug 31 2008 	Perfect	Stayed here twice in 3 weeks for business whilst visting trade shows at Olympia and showrooms in central London.I booked both times through Travelsupermarket.com and got good deals on both occasions (including breakfast which is a huge saving.)First time I stated was at the start of August. When my colleague and I arrived they have mistakenly booked us a double room and told me that they were fully booked, I was beginning to curse my good deal, however the manager told us to have a complimentary drink in the bar whilst they sorted us out. Few glasses of wine later they had sorted out the room and provided a twin and a complimentary bottle of Tattinger in our room which was a very nice gesture  especially a I hadnt booked through them and offered to upgrade us the next night to an apartment.Room - clean, roomy and good standard of dcorBathroom - very pleasant with a great shower,Breakfast - I wouldn't pay the hotel prices  but excellent as it was included, bar a small supplement of 5 per person to upgrade to the full. Very good selection.Service: 10/10 very pleased with the staff, all very friendly, especially the duty manager and very tall doorman!I re booked this when I had to come back to London 2 weeks later. Very happy on both occasions"
80,531,"Aug 27 2008 	What a Wonderful Hotel!	The Boyfriend and I headed for the bright city lights of London once again to celebrate his entry into middle age (I keep telling him 40 is the old 30 but will he listen???). Anyway, dear reader I digress.I booked The Athenaeum Hotel via Last Minute as one of their Secret Hotels and paid the princely sum of 246 of your Earth Pounds for two nights room only.I rang the hotel during the week to say it was The Boyfriends Birthday if they were able to do anything speacial, not having any expectations at all.On arrival, we were made so welcome by the delightful Alexis. The car was whisked away by John the doorman to be secreted away until we next required it!We had been given an upgrade and then to our delight we found we had been given a suite overlooking the park with a bottle of wine awaiting our arrival! Alexis showed us the room and we really felt very special.The room was lovely, a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room, all in immaculate order and clean and comfortable. We were amazed to hear that they are in the process of renovation, as it certainly didnt feel tired or look worn.I would definately recommend this hotel for its location. Buckingham Palace is across the park, and Picadilly just a short walk along the road.In summary, if I had the choice of The Sanderson (see review under The Peke) or The Athenaeum, for location and value for money, this one wins hands down.Thanks to all that looked after us.The Peke and The Boyfriend (who thought it was 'rather marvellous')."
81,531,"Aug 24 2008	Delightful stay!	We have a wonderfuyl stay at the Athenaeum!....We were greeted warmly and given a room upgrade upon arrival: a lovely room, light and spacious, with a view of Green Park. We found the service outstanding and the breakfast was, in my view, the best breakfast I ever had in comparable hotels!... We had read reviews commenting on the need for the hotel to be refurbished, and the manager told us they were starting to work on the renovations. But our room was absolutely perfect in every detail. We simply loved the Athenaeum and plan to go back as soon as possible!"
82,531,"Aug 23 2008 	Well ! What a pleasant surprise-	Last week we managed to obtain a late deal at this hotel.Having stayed in many London hotels over countless years, always 4 or 5 star, we found this non-chain establishment to be a little gem. The Doorman was always helpful, carrying bags,getting taxies,opening the doors and making sure you did not slip(in the rain). So often today the doormen seem to disappear when needed. The gentleman on check-in was very helpful &amp; efficient. Unfortunately our room was still being cleaned,so we had to wait about 15 mins during which time we were offered the use of the spa and refreshments. Our room was not huge, but comparable with other London hotels. It was spotlessly clean with a very comfortable bed and good quality bed linen. It had all the normal facilities you would expect from a first class hotel, incuding hangers with hooks(those clip in things are my pet hate) plus a useful London information guide to keep. The breakfast/dining room was very comfortable,with a choice of a buffet and cooked breakfast,as well as a good selection of items to order. At first glance the buffet looks quite small, but this is an advantage as everything is freshly topped up. There was a good choice of meats, cheese,cereal,yoghurt,fresh fruit - it even had fresh honeycomb. The cooked breakfast could not be faulted and refills of tea &amp; coffee were always offerered by the attentive &amp; polite staff.We did not dine a the hotel but we had an excellent lunch snack in the lounge.At this hotel all we can say about &quot;Afternoon Tea&quot; is just have it and enjoy !!Altough we did not use the concierge service it seemed excellent : you actually sit down at a desk unlike other hotels where you stand at a counter. Throughout our stay the Executive Manager always stopped to chat &amp; ask us if everything was OK and if we were enjoying our visit. Indeed all the staff were equally attentive &amp; helpful.To sum up, this hotel is what many hotels aspire to but because of limited &amp; untrained staff, nearly always fail. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
83,531,"Aug 12 2008 	Lovely Boutique Hotel in Great Location	My family (2 adults and 2 kids) and I have just returned from staying at this beautiful boutique hotel. On arrival, we were immediately greeted by Jim (Doorman) who asked for all our names and remembered them during our stay, I would have to say that it was the best welcome we've ever received and our kids loved it. He was also very helpful and gave us some good advice. I loved the decor and thought the lounge was extremely beautiful. The bedrooms are a good size although I feel that they are in need of redecorating. The location is excellent. We had no problem with road noise and we would stay there again. We found the staff very pleasant but special mention goes to Jim!"
84,531,"Aug 8 2008 	Allright	I can't really say anything too bad about this hotel. The location is superb and so is the staff. However, we found it quite difficult to sleep there due to the noise. We had a room on the seventh floor overlooking the main room and the noise of the cars, sirens and honks at night time was unbearable. I would expect a 5 star hotel to have proper windows to isolate the noise but unfortunately this was not the case. The pilows were also quite bad (paper thin) so I had to call reception to get new ones. The size of the room and bathroom was quite small for a 5 star hotel but good enough for London. The overall impression would not be very good if the hotel were not in London, but in this case it was, so i'd recomend it."
85,531,Aug 4 2008 	Wonderful Hotel and Staff	Got a room as part of a theatre package and was stunned at both the quality of the hotel and staff.One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.
86,531,"Jul 15 2008	nightmare...!!!	it was the first time we stayed at the athenaeum and we will never come back again, we will rather advise everyone not to visit your hotel at all!!! when i called the hotel directly i was &quot;welcome&quot; by switchboard who didnt even say any name. when i had asked speaker about her name, she said &quot;i said it jet, Meg speaking&quot; she sounded as she was forced to do so. at last she had transfered me to the resevation department where i had very nice conversation with Kinda who made the booking very efficiently informing about all facilities provided. i thought it was over, but when we got to the hotel, we had been waiting for checkin in for 5 mins,before indian guy who was doing something asked if we would like to check, in fact there was noone else, that was like a nighrmare, very poor customer service, we both work for abn amro and we will inform our department"
87,531,"Jul 8 2008	Superb location	One of the best locations in London, the park across the road, a stroll to Piccadilly and St James. Great restaurants nearby (try the fashionable Wolseley), Fortnum &amp; Mason, bookshops and art galleries. We had an apartment on the side road of the hotel, which was extremely comfortable. Would be very happy to stay there again."
88,531,"Jul 5 2008 	Pleasant surprise!	My patrner and I got a good deal on this hotel, we weren't expecting the best, and from the outside initially still had reservations. All was dismissed as soon as we walked in and experienced a very cute boutique hotel. The staff and the interior were fabulous and we truely recommend."
89,531,"Jun 30 2008 	Great breakfast staff very helpful and friendly.	I have stayed here on a number of occasions over the past couple of years and have enjoyed every visit. The location is excellent, with all the main shopping areas within walking distance and lots of restaurants/cafes on the doorstep. I have stayed in all their different grades of room and the only difference between them, in my opinion, is the size, as the facilities were excellent in all (my only complaint being a slightly short bed in the suite). The decor of the rooms, although a bit dated in places, is well maintained with individual touches everywhere. The breakfast is particularly good (try the creme brulee - odd for breakfast but it is truly delicious). The health spa, although small, is very clean and well run, with an excellent choice of treatments. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a business or leisure stay."
90,531,"Jun 26 2008 	WIll NOT return to the Athenaeum Hotel	When I booked this hotel I thought it would be just like any other 5 star hotel (especially for the price), but I had a rude awakening. Check in went without a problem. When I got to my room, it was dirty, smelled dank and was just not what I had expected. My friend was 2 rooms away and his room had stains on the carpet, bedspread and curtains. We tried to get him a new room, but the staff told us they were completely booked and offered no solution. I stayed for 2 weeks with a group of friends (we ended up with a total bill of just under $100,000 US!). Those who stayed in the apartments absolutely loved their rooms. They were well furnished, very clean, had private entrances, kitchenettes and washing machines in the apartment. Any call to room service was answered immediately. The rest of us who stayed within the hotel building experienced awful room service. Any time we tried to get information from the concierge, the two men at the desk would just joke amongst each other and give us half answers (we didn't know until the last few days of our trip that we were so close to the royal palace, literally a 3 minute walk). The front desk was also of very little help during our stay. I also mailed a very small box home to the US (it weighed 2 pounds) and was charged $100 US by the hotel! They told me that they had to pay for special currier service to get the package to the 'international shipping center.' I had already sent boxes home from various European cities at this point and knew that this was not the case.One good point is that the hotel is located close to great shops and restaurants. The hotel restaurant was also very agreeable. We were in London again just 3 weeks later and changed all of our reservations from the Athenaeum to the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park (which was absolutely fabulous!)."
91,531,"Jun 24 2008 	Surprisingly good	We stayed for 2 nights in this hotel, chosen mainly for its extremely good location. However it proved to be surprisingly good. The rooms were very clean with lovely linen, but the best bit was the standard of the staff. Every single person was helpful and went out of their way to help. Well done you lot. You managed to turn what might have been a stay of convenience into a nice mini-break. I think we will do it again."
92,531,"Jun 17 2008 	Very Special Vacation	We recently stayed in the Athenaeum Hotel Apartments. We had friends in London and wanted a place where everyone could come by and visit. We found the apartments online with a sitting area, a small well equipted kitchen, and a lovely balcony. We needed 2 rooms and were able to get one that connected and opened in between, which gave us 2 living rooms along with 2 kitchens. We could not believe how gorgeous and inviting the rooms were. We really hated to leave the room at all! They had also stocked the fridge with breakfast items and such at our request. We had been traveling the week before and were able to do some laundry in the machines provided in our rooms (BIG PLUS). I had contacted the hotel ahead to ask about special arrangements as we were celebrating a college graduation, 50th birthday, and wedding anniversary. They told me not to worry and that they would take care of it. Wow were we suprised at how they remembered each and every detail and arranged a special treat for each occasion at their expense ( Flowers, Champagne,Chocolates and Strawberries,Cakes and Cheese Trays). We have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and have never had such royal treatment! Any time we called down for anything they were knocking at the door before we could hang up the phone. I'm sure there are many fine hotels in London, but when we return in the future there will be only one place for us and that's the ATHENAEUM HOTEL. The Doormen even remembered our name after only one day. Thank you for making our vacation PERFECT!!! P.S. The afternoon tea is also something not to miss!"
93,531,"Jun 16 2008 	Not Good!	I cannot tell you how excited I was to stay at the Athenaeum having been there for afternoon tea the year before, but it was not good!My husband and I paid for his parents and ourselves to stay over after going to see Spamalot, which was fab! We arrived at noon and our rooms were not ready, not a problem as we knew that check in was not until 2pm. As we were booking in the receptionist answered the phone whilst attending to me, I found this very rude as she didn't even say excuse me.When we go into our rooms they had very kindly given my Father in law a bottle of wine as it was his birthday, which was a nice touch. That's about the only positive.The rooms need decorating now. The paint was peeling off, the wallpaper all marked and the rooms looked very shabby. Our room was better than my in laws but that's not really saying much. I put a cup of tea down on the side and the faux leather (plastic) metled and left lovely ring marks.......classy!Afternoon tea and cocktails, although pricey, were good.When we got back from the Theatre at about 11pm we went to my in laws room for a drink. The people next door were having some kind of a rave....not good, and not what I'd expect from a 5* hotel, Aiya Napa, yes! I phoned down and they did send someone up to ask them to turn it down. They did......about 30 mins later the fire alarm went off (we were on the 9th floor). So down we all went. We over heard that it had been set off by the same people next door. We then had to walk back up to the 9th floor and then went to bed.Air con very noisy but we slept unlike my in laws who were awoken at 3-30 / 4-00 / 4-30 by the club dance music next to them. They did phone and someone did go up to ask them to stop......If they are causing this many problems why allow them to stay in the hotel? They didn't even ask if my in-laws wanted to move rooms (the hotel was not full).We checked out early as they couldn't get back to sleep. Breakfast didn't tempt us at 27 each!They did ask us if we enjoyed our stay and we told them what we had gone through. She did say that if we come back that it wouldn't happen again...possibly but at that kind of cost for the room, I'll go and find another 5* Hotel."
94,531,"Jun 10 2008 	Awful experience at the Athenaeum	I had the most awful experience I've ever had at any hotel I've stayed at during my stay at the Athenaeum Hotel in March/April this year - the night before I left, I found a rat in my room. When I called the front desk, they didn't even sound genuinely apologetic and I was moved to another room for my last night. Even before this incident, though, I had already decided I would never stay at the hotel again because in the few weeks that I was staying there, I found many of the concierge to be unfriendly and the service to be of a consistently low-standard, especially for the room rates charged. I did my drycleaning there and had to return a pair of pants three times, and another shirt twice, before stains were removed that I had pointed out each time. Further, the rooms are tiny. The best part about the hotel is the gym, it's small, but great new equipment. The location is also fantastic especially if you can get a room with a view over Green Park, but for the price you'll be paying, I'd definitely recommend staying at the Intercontintental or the Radisson Mayfair.This was a disappointing stay and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
95,531,"May 28 2008 	Great hotel in central london	Stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel in London for two nights in mid-May. Found a fantastic deal on the room (single room) on Skoosh.com Paid 192 dollars for two nights including continental breakfast. Room was lovely, a double bed, clean and bright bath. Staff was amazing. From the first greeting by &quot;big Jim&quot; the derby hatted doorman, to reception, to everyone on the wait staff they could not have been nicer. Was traveling alone and they made me feel very comfortable. Had high tea and Sunday dinner and the food was excellent. continental breakfast included in the room rate was large and lovely- every kind of pastry, fruit, fresh yogurt, and cereals. The location of this hotel is excellent, on Piccadilly directly across from Green Park. Finally, the spa in the basement level is small but great. a steam room, a sauna, and a lovely jacuzzi, perfect for a soak before bed after a day of walking. Hope to return often."
96,531,"Apr 22 2008 	Rooms need updating	I have had several enjoyable stays at this hotel in the past, but sadly this time was not so good.We stayed in a Parkview room, which was clearly in need of refurbishment. The chairs were stained, as was the headboard and the room in general was quite grubby.We were also unimpressed by the cleaner knocking at the door at 7.50 to clean the room (we were only staying one night!).The Lobby, Restaurant and Garden Room are all very nice and have been refurbished. We had a lovely evening meal and particularly enjoyed returning from the Theatre to have our dessert served to us in the garden room.We would stay again, but only after the refurb!"
97,531,"Apr 13 2008 	Great experience - recommended	Chose this hotel through last minute's secret selection and was really pleased as it was for a birthday treat.On arrival we were upgraded to a penthouse room on the 10th floor with stunning views over green park and the London panorama. The room was warm, welcoming and comfortable with room to relax and rest. Whilst it is not as pristene or contemporary as some of it's competitors this only adds to its quirkiness and charm.All the staff were helpful and charming from the doorman, to the reception staff and in house dining team. The whisky bar is to be recommended and although we did not partake the afternoon tea looked fab.All in all a great bijoux boutique hotel with a little soul.We would certainly return for another stay."
98,531,"Mar 31 2008 	Great location OK needs some updating	My husband and I took our 2 kids (13, and 15) to London and Paris for spring break and after a ton of internet research settled on this hotel in London. While it's location was great it was sort of just OK as far as looks go. Could use some updating (chairs in room were worn thin on the arms-nicked tables in the lobby, etc) That said it wasn't a bad experience just not exactly 5 star. Room was small-which I would expect from UK but it was really small with a tiny bathroom. They had contacted us before we got there to say that we would need to upgrade ($$) to a different room configuration because of the ages of our kids or split up and each stay in a room with them. We ditched the upgrade idea, but did (upon seeing the tiny size of our rooms) look into upgrading to an apt. when we got there. Way too much money so we just made do. Kids stayed in their room and were fine.Shower was good, beds were comfortable. I was awoken one night to the sound of some guys business call next door so maybe not the quietest. Breakfast was outrageously priced but I have to blame the value of the US dollar for that one. Starbucks and M&amp;S foods down the street served us well for breakfast.Common areas (bar and breakfast room ) again need updating. Staff was pleasant but not altogether eager to please. Asked to see the room service menu while we were in the bar having a drink (to see if that's what the kids wanted to do) and it really threw the front desk girl for a loop as they didn't have any downstairs and she couldn't quite figure out a solution (other than me trotting up to the room to get it--which is what I was trying to avoid!) Also asked us it we wanted a free newspapaer each morning--said yes and never got one for the whole stay (3 days)However they did offer to keep the hot tub open longer after we went for a dip late in the day.Great location, decent value given the prices in London, just don't expect luxury."
99,531,"Mar 31 2008 	great room - poor special dietary requirements	My husband booked this for my birthday I really liked the hotel, our executive room was spacious , the reception staff and door man were very helpful. The only fault I have is that although the resturant menu states if you have a special dietary requirment advise them and they can help - they couldn't!! - when I explained my condition of Coeliac disease and what could they provide for breakfast the response from the evening staff ( which was positive) to the breakfast stafff totally changed and they were unable to help at all with my gluten + wheat free diet and therefore I paid 22 for coffee, o juice, yoghurt and some fresh fruit - and left feeling hungry!"
100,531,"Mar 28 2008 	Incredible Value!	We recently stayed at the Athenaeum and couldn't have been happier. I chose this hotel based upon the reviews I read on this website and booked it thru lastminute.com using the &quot;secret hotels&quot; feature. I had a pretty good idea what hotel I was getting. I couldn't believe what a deal it was, particularly given the exchange rate. It is in a great location across from Green Park. From the time we checked in until the time we left, the service was excellent. The rooms were nice, comfortable, and quiet. The beds were comfortably appointed with Frette linens. The bathrooms were all marble and spotless. We did not eat there or use the spa so I can't comment on those. We will definitely stay there again!"
101,531,"Mar 27 2008 	Lovely Hotel	We stayed for three nights and had a pleasant time. The hotel dining room is a little overpriced, but the rooms were very clean and nicely appointed. It is conveniently located to take long walks in the beautiful parks and to pick up the tour bus! The door man is quite a delight!"
102,531,"Mar 25 2008 	Disappointing!	My husband and I recently stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel for two nights for an Easter break. My overall impression of the hotel is that it is really not of a five star standard. The lobby is very small and we were surprised to note that there is no permanent wheelchair access from the street to the lobby and instead a ramp is put in place where necessary. A simple remodelling of the steps would take care of this.The room itself was a good enough size for central London and we requested a view of Green Park which was lovely. The decor however was very dated. We appreciate that some tourists enjoy an &quot;olde worlde&quot; room however the furniture instead of looking antique, actually looked shabby and the curtains and throw on the bed were very worn.The bathroom did not have a separate shower and instead the shower was above the bath. In our opinion that is not what one would expect of a five star establishment. On our last morning in the room the television stopped working. We booked our room through a website and our receipt stated that the rate paid was for &quot;Bed and Breakfast&quot;. We therefore ate a cooked breakfast in the dining room both mornings. On checking out we were presented with a bill. When we queried this bill we were told it was for our breakfast. We pointed out that we paid for bed and breakfast and we were told that it is continental breakfast only that is included. The girl at reception produced a computer printout from the hotel stating that it was continental breakfast and we produced our receipt (which we thankfully had brought with us) and pointed out to her that nowhere did it state that only continental breakfast was included and also pointed out that no one either at check in or at breakfast had told us that only continental breakfast was included in our room rate. After much haggling the Manager at reception told the girl to remove the charge for the breakfast from our bill. Clearly this is something that the hotel should clear up with the agents selling their rooms. In summary we would not stay at this hotel again and nor would we recommend it to others. We have stayed in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch previously, which was less expensive and far superior."
103,531,"Mar 21 2008 	Great Hotel in Great Location	Great Hotel room 916 on inside of building was very quiet, no traffic noise. Breakfast was beautifully done and perfectly cooked although pricey at 27--yes, it was worth it! Dinner was very good and reasonably priced 21 for 2 courses-great value in a small intimate restaurant. Booked Hotel through www.cheaperthanhotels.co.uk , this site seemed to have good value hotels that were a good price--unlike most that claim to do so.Good service and welcoming in a small hotel--will be refurbished soon but rooms still to a very good standard."
104,531,"Feb 29 2008 	Poor Service - Phone Charges	Stayed four days for a business trip - ended on a low note with their surprising phone charges.Before placing calls to the U.S. from the hotel, I called the hotel operator and told them I was using a 1-800 card and what would be the charge? They replied back 1.75 pounds per call connection with no mention of a charge per minute (in actuality it was 2 pounds per connection since they had recently done some kind of in-house upgrade). Later that night I check my in-room TV and the bill was not available. The recording made no mention of the charge per minute. When I checked out, I recieved a shocking bill of over 500 pounds for less than 100 minutes of calls. The on-site manager even argued that it had been a problem in the past (yet nothing had been done to correct these problems). I did not have all day to fight the charges since I was catching a flight out, so I was able to get 40% of the bill taken off still reflecting 3 pounds per minute. Many hotels only pay 1-2 pence per minute that would give them 150x profit at 2 pence per minute for the &quot;operating overhead.&quot; I gave them notice that I was not satisfied and they would be taking it up later. After multiple letters, the hotel refuses to change their stance. All I can say is &quot;buyer beware.&quot; Based on my calculation (27 pounds for a five minute call to New York), the Athenaeum would be the top of the list of shame on charges from London hotel for outgoing calls.

105,531,Feb 15 2008 	Loved	My husband and 2 small children stayed here and loved it!! It is an excellent way to enjoy London with Apartment living with hotel amenities. The service was outstanding and I would recommend this hotel for families. My husband and I plus kids have travelled to London on several occassions and have found this hotel to be the best.
106,531,"Feb 12 2008 	If you need an incentive to start jogging ......	A wonderful stay in this hotel. Beautiful park views and a rare glimpse of some warm sunshine made our trip outstanding. All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the doormen who have to be amongst the best in london. Joggers, you're in for a treat! Towels and water are considerately placed by the hotel exit to make your run a bit more special! Almost made me want to start exercising.Good bedrooms although i never worked out how the cd players worked. Beautiful decor too. I have a phobia of lifts so always find myself wandering around the hotel stairs at odd hours- often a miserable experience as regular readers of my reviews will know. This hotel gets a 5* from me - even their fire exits are beautiful and well kept! Can't wait to return."
107,531,"Jan 28 2008 	Great location	Good Location close to lovely restaurants in Mayfair. Booked standard room through Lastminute.com and were upgraded to a lovely room overlooking Green Park. The Doorman was delightful and the ladies on reception could learn from his friendly and warm disposition. Didn't use the restaurant as it looked very bright but seemed very popular. The whiskey bar was nice but pricey; we didn't bother with breakfast as there were lots of coffee places close by. Bus stop directly outside and always lots of taxis in that location. Was a very pleasant hotel, didn't blow me away but for the same sort of cost would stay again. Bed was very comfortable with great pillows which is so important."
108,531,"Jan 25 2008 	Perfect By London Standards	This is a real nice little hotel (by London standards). Obviously room was on the smallish size, but that's par for the course so I didn't mark them down on that.Reception and check in was flawless. Room was pricey, but I only booked it on the night before (so that's my problem), so expect to get it at a reasonable rate (I paid 300 for 1 night)Room was clean, everything worked. It was really comfortable. No complaints on the bathroom either, great shower. Bed was very comfy. Staff were great, I managed to get a late checkout, with no problem at all.Location is nice, but very posh."
109,531,"Jan 24 2008	Average - not a 5 star experience	I booked a weekend break for myself &amp; my husband on lastminute.com. I had originally chosen this as a possible hotel to book directly through their own website. However, having read the description on a top secret deal on last minute, it was blatantly obvious that this was the Athenaeum. There was a considerable difference in price and this was the only reason I booked with last minute.com and not with the hotel direct. I phoned the hotel a few days prior to arrival to confirm that we were in fact booked in. I enquired as to whether our room was facing Green Park. I was told that such rooms were available but at a charge of 50 per night. I declined and took my chances! Our room was overlooking a side street (Down St) not much of a view. I have to say that I generally don't comment on these sites but felt that having read previous reviews, upgrades seem to be dished out in a somewhat haphazard manner. Seems to be the luck of the draw on the day or who shouts the loudest. Our room was a standard double, ok for what we paid I guess, but it had a long way to go to being 5 star. Our double bed was 2 single mattresses pushed together, disappointing. The room was pleasant and clean, bathroom also clean. Toiletries are Neutrogena, not 5 star products. Rooms are cleaned every day which is great. We accepted the offer of a complimetary newspaper which we didn't receive on the first day. I would normally be someone who would voice an opinion when a product or service wasn't up to standard, however, as I booked with last minute at a price lower that the hotel charge, I felt I wouldn't be within my rights as such. Location wise, the hotel is so central which I was delighted with. I didn't eat in the hotel so couldn't comment. We did have a drink in the hotel bar one evening, pricey but pleasant. Staff very courteous in this area but at check in I found lady quite curt. I wouldn't stay again in a standard room. I feel I maybe would have had a vastly different experience had I paid over the odds and booked with the hotel."
110,531,"Jan 20 2008 	Excellent value central London Friendly hotel	Stayed for one night this weekend and I was very impressed by the friendly staff, great room and excellent location. I would recommend this hotel for anyone looking for 4/5 * in central London and not wanting to pay silly money. We booked on lastminute.com and got a standard double for 145, we were assigned an executive double on arrival which was slightly bigger . The bed was very comfortable with very nice linens and the bathroom was small but classy. The spa is small but clean and nice and the bar cosy. We did not eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food. Very handy for Green Park tube (with its M&amp;S food store if you don't want to pay mini bar prices).I will definitely stay again if available at this price."
111,531,"Jan 14 2008 	Great value loved it!	Stayed here for two nights with my girlfriend in January and it was PERFECT! The staff were fantastic: friendly and helpful. We booked on lastminute.com as part of the Top Secret Hotels deal (with a bit of detective work you can figure out which one is the Athenaeum by Googling parts of the description). It was 145 per night for their normal class of room - spacious room, big comfortable bed, nice seating area with view of the park, large bathroom with tub and a great shower. Everything was right, from the quality toiletries to the super soft robes and the big Bose television. They have a great 24 hour bar/lounge, perfect for midnight snacking after a night out on the town. Location was fantastic, only 10 minutes walk from Leicester Square, or 5 minutes to Green Park tube. If you can get a good deal online for this hotel then pelase stay here, you'll love it! This was absolutely a five star experience.If you are going to see a concert at the O2 Arena (Millenium Dome) it may look like this hotel is far away, but really its only 25 minutes on the Jubilee Line between the O2 and Green Park, so do consider this hotel!"
112,531,"Dec 31 2007	Post Christmas treat ath the Athenaeum	I was very excited to find a deal at the Athenaeum hotel which I've tried to get into for a couple of years. It's location is spot on being just opposite Hyde Park.1. Check-in Rather surprisingly for a private hotel check- in was done in the usual queuing up way and we were served by a pleasant  young lady who unfortunately answered the phone at the  same time which I usually find rather annyoying but I was distracted by a huge jar of jelly babies which took my mind off it!2. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with outstanding views of the park and also as it was my husband's birthday a free bottle of wine from the General Manager. All the staff were extremely gracious.3. The Decor is pleasant and light and airy and two comfortable  chairs by the window was a thoughtful additon as we were ablel to relax instantly drinking our wine and watching the  sun go down.4. The concierge service was reliable and helpful, and we only  have a couple of niggles about the hotel. We were offered a  complimentary newspaper which was not delivered to our room - however we were given one to take home with us when this oversight had been noticed. There was no milk for tea or coffee in the rooms either and when we went to retreive our luggage after a weary morning around the King Tuk exhibition there was a mixup and a long delay before it was found which meant we were in a huge rush to get across London for our  train. Overall we enjoyed the hotel and would stay there again if the price was right - but I wouldn't pay rack rate for it. We usually stay aat the Langham in London, and if you can get an executive room there then I still prefer it, but it made a nice change."
113,531,"Nov 18 2007 	A real Find !	We stayed for 1 night this past weekend. We managed to get a fantastic rate and they kindly upgraded us to an Apartment. It was nicely decorated in traditional English style. It was large and clean. There was a plasma TV in the living room and a TV in the bedroom. The staff were super friendly and kind. The place is really well done up. Seems to have had a refurb recently. It is ideally located as you may have read. Next time we hope to have a room with a view and stay in the hotel bit. This is trully a 5 star hotel with a terrific staff. Both my wife and I really enjoyed our stay. If you can get a good rate, I would highly recommend the hotel. We booked through Lastminute."
114,531,"Nov 17 2007	Athenaeum is Awesome!	My wife and I spent a week at the Athanaeum, and we couldn't have enjoyed it more. We were greeted with a smile by Bill, the quintessential British doorman, who welcomed us as though we were returning regulars, though it was our first stay ... our room was splendid, featuring a spectacular view of Green Park's fall foliage ... the concierge got us tickets for the sold-out &quot;Buddy Holly, The Musical&quot; in the West End ... the Athenaeum is centrally-located, only a short walk to Piccadilly Circus, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace ... the hotel restaurant, Damask, rates four stars ... they offer a sumptuous breakfast buffet, and a great menu for dinner ... hotel staff is friendly and gracious, and works hard to ensure a perfect stay. We can't wait to return to London for another week at the Athenaeum!"
115,531,"Nov 15 2007 	Awesome hotel with the best staff.	My best friend and I recently stayed @ this hotel for 10 days and had the best experience ever. The staff especially Alfred and Dan who are so helpful and friendly. The room service is available at any hour of the day and as we found out late nite 3 am. This is not party central but they r not so uptight that your stay becomes hum drum and boring,all the great things you want in a four or five star space without the attitude. A 3 min walk across the park and your at the gates of Buckingham Palace, Hermes,burberry stella etc are 5 min away .We have stayed at a couple trendy boutique hotels and this is one of the best so far ; we will definately b staying here again and hopefully getting an apt next visit. Btw room 704 has an amazing view overlooking the park."
116,531,"Oct 30 2007 	Wow what a gem!	For the second time in my life I booked a hotel on Priceline by bidding (bid for 5 * hotel - central London), and I am so happy that I did, because we got the best hotel I have ever stayed in in London! When we arrived rather late on a Friday evening we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff and when the room we were given did not meet our wishes (it was a smoking room with double bed) we were instead given a very nice and roomy apartment - for the entire stay. Simply wonderful! We had dinner at the hotel restaurant as we arrived late - and to our pleasant surprise it was an excellent meal and very fairly priced - two courses were just 20 (the same as the breakfast buffet).We wanted a 5 star hotel in the middle of London and that is exactly what we got. My mother and I were on a girls trip to London and wanted to be near all the great shopping that London has to offer, and were very pleased with the location of the hotel. It is situated within walking distance from Oxford street, Bond Street (new and old), Regent street and Knightsbridge with Harvey Nichols and Harrods and Sloan street. Of course we got a great deal on Priceline, but I would definitively be willing to pay the full price the next time I go to London!"
117,531,"Oct 28 2007 	Comfortable apartment with hotel amenieties	We booked a one bedroom apartment, with the classic interior. The price is quite high compared to other apartments but we received the equivelant of a 5 star hotel service.The bedroom is comfortable, looking onto a quiet street, we could open the windows, a plus.The bathroom was quite small, but fine.The lounge was comfortable with a dining alchove and a small kitchenette. Soft drinks were complimentary and we were made to feel very welcome.Being part of the hotel we were able to use the hotel facilities such as dining rooms and lounges. They have a very large lounge which was great for meetings and the service was very good.The location is excellent in central London, we enjoy walking and nowhere was too far.We would probably stay there again."
118,531,"Oct 22 2007 	Nice place	Friendly staff, great location right on the park, and clean, comfortable rooms. Bathrooms efficient, great showers, but a bit small. Decor a bit too traditional for my tatste though."
119,531,"Oct 22 2007 	Fantastic experience	I had not been in London for a while, but remembered the city from its overpriced dingy hotels and ridiculous pricelevel. I travel quite a bit so I am not easily impressed (or chocked for that matter) by a new hotel experience. But can I just say: the Athenaeum did just that. What an amazing stay. I was there just for one (weekend-) night. London was at its best, sunny and warm for October, perfect for going out you would say. Well, I just did not want to leave the room, I spend afternoon, evening, night and most of the morning until check out in the room. Anyone who complains about the design of the hotel after its obvious refurbishment should have a second look. The lobby is just spectacular in design and detail. I was met by extremely efficient and super friendly check in staff. This person walked me to the room which was one the apartments that are part of the hotel. Mine was in the second or third building on the 4th flloor (8 apartments in each house I assume). These houses have been restored with the most incredible eye for detail. Spectacular finishing, and modern and edgy design is just everywhere. I loved it!The apartment was just breathtaking. Decorated in what I would describe a very very New York type of atmosphere. Dark, glamorous and just incredibly comfortable. Very high beautiful ceilings. I love hotels that have thought of every detail. Well this is one. Anything you would/could think of is anticipated here. This apartment had a livingroom, open pantry, hallway, bedroom and nice basic bathroom. All the amenities you want and more than that. With M&amp;S deli foodmarket around the corner (I am talking gourmet food here), it was just heaven to drink champagne and eat lobster and just hang out in the apartment. The Athenaeum gave new meaning to the word romance for me! I had the most romantic stay in a hotel in ages. Who needs London nightlife, theatre, culture ...if you have this, well I don't.Roomservice breakfast was fantastic and on the dot on time and don't you love there are no extra charges. No Service charge, no delivery charge nothing. I am always so anoyed by the extra's. If I spent $ 800 or more on a room I really don't care about paying $ 20 for a burger but don't break up the price in all charges, taxes and fees and show me the details when I am hungry and about to enjoy the food/drinks you just brought to my room. Guests dont care!! At 24 pounds per person for breakfast I thought this was absolute value for money. With this fantastic apartment I did not see any other part of the hotel so I cant comment on that. It's location is beautiful and convenient. I will be back to this hotel."
120,531,"Oct 15 2007 	excellent hotel	We booked this as part of a theatre break with last minute. We were upgraded to a suite , (as promised by last minute -subjest to availability).The suite was very sumptious - red wall paper in the bedroom, 'antique' furnitire and a very large bathroom with floors and walls covered in marble.The room overlooked Green Park which I was glad about having read some of the previous reviews . . .Breakfast was not included in the deal and at 20 a head was was very expensive, however, the breakfast was excellent with a good selection of fruit and other things one would not normally associate with breakfast . . . (creme brulee for example!) and a full English.The TV looked a bit dated and I don't think there were any wi fi facilities but I may be wrong about that.The hotel is ideally located for theatre land, just stroll up Picadilly to Picadilly Circus and you are in thetre land."
121,531,"Sep 24 2007 	Falls well short of 5star standard	I booked a standard double at the The Athenaeum, London through Lastminute.com &quot;Top Secret&quot; deal. This is my 10th booking with Lastminute top secret deals and this first time i have been disappointed, and boy did this hotel disappoint. This 5star Hotel fell well short of the mark; Id rate it as a run down 3star at best. I didnt experience any of the quoted &quot;excellent service&quot;, &quot;luxury surroundings&quot;, etc. The rooms are run down and poorly equipped. Service is unhelpful and frosty.On arrival i was greeted and allocated room 312. This was a standard double; the room did not have &quot;timeless views of Green Park&quot; but rather depressing views of a side street and convenience store. The room was extremely small including a very small bed which was old, lumpy and hard, the hotel web site quotes them as being hypnois beds! The furniture far from being &quot;quintessentially English, but distinctly modern in its richness&quot; was just old and worn; it couldnt even have passed as being &quot;rustic&quot;. The bathroom although marble and mirrored was tiny as well, the receptionist who was showing me around had to wait outside as there was no room for both of us to fit in. I have never stayed in a 5star hotel where the bathroom was equipped with a half size bath with shower over it and a shower curtain! The white towles supplied throughout the stay were old and thread worn. The soft furnishings and carpets are also in need of upgrading. I informed reception that Room 312 was unsatisfactory and requested they move me to a different room. They offered to show me Room 503, an executive room, this &quot;upgrade&quot; would come at an additional charge of 45+vat &amp; tax per night. On negotiation with the Duty Manager he agreed to waive the fee on this occasion, but did spend 15min arguing with me first about my &quot;unreasonable&quot; expectations of a 5star Hotel for the price paid. He insisted Lastminute.com must be advertising the wrong description. I was under the impression star ratings are awarded to a Hotel as a whole not to certain 5star rooms within a lower grade establishment? I had no choice but to move to Room 503. This room although larger than the first it was still the same poor standard as the previous. The bath and shower were exactly the same size. The bed size was increased by pushing two single mattresses together and covering with a sheet only a single duvet was on the bed, pulled tightly to cover both mattresses, needless to say we had some fighting for the covers throughout the two nights. There were no Tea or Coffee making facilities in the room, but is does have a tiny extremely overpriced mini-bar, which was not re-stocked throughout our stay. Budget 3.50 for a can of cola. No complementary drinks etc are provided. On the evening of the first night they provided a turn down service, but not on the second evening. The Reception staff &amp; Concierge are unfriendly and did not make our stay anymore pleasant. There was no concierge working on the Saturday night on our return from dinner. On each occasion we asked for a taxi we were informed that there were none available and to &quot;flag&quot; one down on the main road. We choose to cancel our reservations for dinner and beauty treatments and take our business elsewhere so therefore am unable to provide a review of these services. My advice would be to book with The Mayfair or the Millennium Mayfair for quality and service, I have stayed with these hotels on several occasions in the past. This hotel is NOT reflective of its 5star status."
122,531,"Sep 23 2007 	Expected so much got so little	Booked as part of a theatre package from lastminute. The hotel fell far short of being 5star - our room was not ready for us some two hours after the check in time. They also demanded 100 off me before checking in as a deposit (even though i had paid for room already), this is something not advertised at the time of booking. When in the room the private bar was half empty as it had not been restocked and most of the food in the private bar was between 3-5weeks out of date. I tried to complain at the time but the lady who came into the room could not speak a word of english. Got the wrong newspaper, breakfast really was not worth the cost. Definately not a five star!!!!! Could write so much more that was wrong with this hotel but cannot be bothered."
123,531,"Sep 21 2007 	5 star all the way	We booked a theatre break through last minute. The hotel was wonderful. We were initally put in a very small room overlooking the air conditioning vents and I was a little disappointed. We settled into the room but could not work the TV! A quick call to reception and we had someone with us quickly. We were then moved to a different room that had the views I was looking forward to. Room 901!! We were overlooking Green Park and could see the London Eye to our left. Lovely views at night and much bigger than our first room. Overall the staff couldn't do enough for you, the surroundings were luxrious and location was fantastic! Definately recommended for a romantic getaway!"
124,531,"Aug 17 2007	Nice hotel great rates	This hotel is well located, on Piccadilly, and a few minutes walk from either Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace (through Green Park) or Hyde Park corner. It is surrounded by other four and five star hotels, and has plenty of other eating and drinking establishments near by.The hotel itself is a nice, well furnished, well decorated building in the style that you would expect from such an establishment. The staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly throughout, and pleasant to deal with. I overheard some of the staff giving tourist advice to other guests, that was delivered both accurately and with good humour.Our room was relatively large and well equipped, and the bed was remarkably comfortable.One of the best things about the hotel was the price. It seemed to be the cheapest premium hotel in the area, which made what was already a pleasant stay even better.I would certainly recommend this establishment."
125,531,"Aug 4 2007 	Beautiful hotel Great Service!	From the time we arrived by taxi, greeted by the doorman with a smile, and had our bags taken for us, we were treated like royalty. We stayed here for a Romantic weekend through Last minute's secret hotels and got a very good rate. Once we checked in, the receptionist accompanied us to our room and showed us all the amenities available. A very nice touch. The room was plenty big enough with everything you could need. Lots of mirrors make it look spacious, the bed was very comfortable, the shower was very powerful, and we had great views from the top floor of london and green park.The gym and spa downstairs is very nicely done, with dressing gowns and towels provided. We did not have breakfast here, but went around to shepherds market where there was a good choice of cafes. The bar is very cosy and intimate, which we loved, the service very attentive and friendly. We had afternoon tea in the garden room, which is beautifully done out with comfy sofas, and the selection of sandwiches and cakes were delicious. It is certainly one of the friendliest hotels I have stayed at, everyone is smiling and want to ensure you have everything you need. When my wife requested foam pillows instead of the feather ones provided at midnight, they were delivered in 5 minutes. Nothing here is too much trouble, and I would certainly recommend it for a romantic getaway. We had a fabulous meal at Galvin At Windows at the top of the Hilton, just a few minutes walk around the corner, which I would highly recommend also"
126,531,"Jul 27 2007 	Apartment Living in London	My husband, 18-year-old son and I stayed here for a week in early July in one of the Athenaeum's apartments, and highly recommend the experience. We had a &quot;Classic&quot; apartment (meaning traditional formal decor) featuring one bedroom, a large living room with dining el, and a petite but serviceable kitchen complete with oven, microwave, washer/dryer and a great espresso machine. It was great to have a washer/dryer during a long stay, but it's the combination type of machine that can only handle very small loads and takes several hours to dry the clothes.The apartment was in a townhouse on a quiet residential street around the corner from the hotel's main entrance. At the end of the street is a terrific tapas restaurant, &quot;El Pirate&quot; (try it!), and across the street is a small convenience store for most food-shopping needs. It was a very comfortable way to stay with a family. The only drawback was that the sole bathroom is through the bedroom, so that impacted everyone's privacy. The hotel has a very nice cocktail lounge area and library off the lobby where good drinks are served; the staff is very pleasant and helpful; and the location, across from Green Park, is lovely. It's about a four-block walk to the nearest tube station, and the neighborhood has lots of great pubs and restaurants. There were a few slips in the service, and the fuses in parts of the apartment blew out a couple of times during our stay, but nothing was seriously wrong. On the whole, this is a great way to stay in London."
127,531,Jul 25 2007 	over all good but some improvements needed	We stayed in a &quot;classic suite&quot; which we had booked through last minute under their top secret hotels. We had already worked out which hotel it was before we booked and had stayed there several years ago before the refurb.Because it was a suite it was extremely spacious and even had a seperate dressing room and huge bathroom. We paid 250 pds for a night. A few things marred the stay though- we arrived early so were happy to go out for a few hours and have some lunch while our room was made ready for us. Unfortunately we still had problems when we arrived back well after the checking in time. We had to wait in reception while it was confirmed whether our room was ready or not still.It was a nice suite overall but the coffee table had something sticky on it and the edges were very dusty still. The carpet was also stained in the seating area. Not really what you expect when you are paying 250 a night. My husband did inform reception as we were also expecting a park view but as the hotel was full they sent up a bottle of champagne which was a nice touch. The room was clean otherwise but some of the furniture seemed a little tired. The lighting was rather confusing too.Location is excellent and the door man is very friendly and helpful.We were due a complimentary paper but never received it. We only had one bathrobe.Overall we enjoyed our stay but will probably try somewhere else next time.
128,531,"Jul 24 2007 	Clean rooms; good staff; hard beds	We stayed here for two nights. The service was super: my only problem was that the bed was *very* hard and that we had a few problems with the light switches, which never worked quite the way one would have expected.Everything was very clean, and overall I feel that it is good value for money.I would like to add that we stayed there in winter, and the heating was more than adequate."
129,531,"Jul 19 2007	It's OK...but...	If you like really hard beds, this is the place for you. I complained and the manager went out and got us a nice foam pad, which was really nice of them. But no-one that I know wants the slab bed anymore!!! And despite the much advertised remodel, this place needs another remodel. We stayed in the 'classic' style apartment, with pretty dinged up furniture, the same old tiny bathrooms and very little storage space. All the electrical outlets are on the floorboards...you should have seen my wife trying to dry her hair. Electricity outlets don't always work and you need a PH.D to turn the lights and other switches on and off. I will say that the staff is great, and this place does have a great location. The owners of the hotel ought to give the staff a better product to work with."
130,531,"Jun 27 2007 	Nice Hotel Good location	The hotel is well located at the one end of piccadilly road. Within easy walking distance of piccadilly circus, oxford st./regent street shopping, theatre district, across the park from Buckingham palace and a short taxi ride to knightbridge &amp; Harrods. The hotel is relatively small but very nice and on the main road. we booked on Londontown.com., just my wife and myself. It was expensive but it is all relative and given the location and the hotel standard, I was happy. We had a standard double room. The room was not particularly big (probably true of most of the hotels in London anyway) but was still reasonable sized, good beds and the bathroom was very nice with bath and strong shower..and most importantly very clean and well kept. otel and the visit. Really enjoyed the hThe staff are very couteous and helpful and friendly. We did not eat in the hotel. Try the local restaurants around the corner in 'Shepards Market'..some very nice restaurants and breakfast available. I would also recommend the Wolsley restaurant down the road beside the Ritz hotel for breakfast and lunch..over priced but worth a visit."
131,531,"Jun 19 2007 	Very nice!	Stayed at the Athenaeum for only one night because of business meetings. When arriving late everything went smooth, got my shirts ironed in 20 minutes. Everything was a smooth and nothing seemed to be a problem.The service was excellent, rooms were clean and nice despite the fact I was given a room with a view over the back yard.I think it was a good atmosphere in the lobby and the whisky room as well as at breakfast, however the breakfast buffe could have been better.Peter Gustafsson"
132,531,"May 28 2007 	smart chic hotel	Booked as a top secret hotel through Last minute.com.Well located smart recpetion, with a boutique feel. Friendly welcome and the rooms are very nice with are the mod cons and personel touches like chilled milk for your tea in the room.Great for a couple of nights in London. Would stay here again"
133,531,May 27 2007 	lovely view from atiny room	feels like an old hotel thats been renovated to look trendy. when staying in london i much prefer the soho hotel.
134,531,"May 1 2007 	Very nice	Stayed for one night in April. Very helpful and pleasant receptionist who showed us to our room as showed us where everything was. Had a standard room, we were offered an upgrade when we got there but decided to stick with what we had. It didn't have much of a view but we weren't there for that. Room wasn't massive but it was nicely decorated as was the bathroom which had a very powerful shower.The spa was small but just what we needed, really powerful jets in the spa pool.The door staff friendly and helpful.We didn't eat there as we were going to a do, also the breakfast was too expensive for us.Its about a five minute walk from Green Park tube station.Overall we were very pleased with this hotel as we had spent ages looking at hotels to stay in London that didn't have bad reviews and break the bank, we got a good deal with lastminute.com."
135,531,"Apr 25 2007 	Brilliant service	My husband and i stayed at the Athenaeum for 1 night. We had booked a standard room, and on arrival asked if there was a possibility of having a room with a view of Green Park. We were told this would cost extra, so we decided to keep the room we'd originally booked. However, on showing us to our room the receptionist told us she had upgraded us to a suite on the tenth floor. The room was lovely, spacious, with a large double (comfortable) bed, a large spa bath and most importantly, a great view overlooking Green Park. You can see the London eye clearly too. We did not eat at the hotel so i cannot comment on the standard of food, however we did use the spa/steam room. Small, but relaxing all the same. Our only complaint was that the sauna wasn't working. There is a small gym with up to date equipment also.In general, we found the hotel to be clean, in good decorative order and in an excellent location. All of the staff were very friendly and we had a wonderful time. We would definitely go back."
136,531,"Apr 24 2007 	spacious apartments	My family and I stayed in the apartments of the hotel, and we were very impressed. The room has a nice kitchenette with stove top, dishwasher and washing machine/dryer. The sofa pulls out to a double bed, and the living room is quite large. There is also a 4 person dinette which was nice for room service breakfast. They can also connect apartments if you have a larger family or need extra space. Rates can be high, but they do offer some good deals and the extra room is well worth it especially with children after a 10 hour flight!  Food and service were also quite good. Food was rather expensive, but the pound vs dollar didn't help. The front desk staff, door staff, and restaurant staff were all very friendly and helpful. Some people have complained about the lounge, but it really is just a place to relax and have a drink. Atmosphere and style are at the surrounding pubs, bars and nightclubs."
137,531,Apr 17 2007 	Excellent Stay	I would Highly reccommend the Athrnaeum hotel if you would like a nice relaxing stay.The hotel is extremley clean &amp; well presented.The staff were so friendly &amp; helpfull through out our stay. It is not a cheep hotel but you are treated well for the money you pay.Are room was large and well equiped with everything you could need.a 15 minute walk to Oxford street &amp; a 5 min walk from Green Park station the hotel is ideally located for a romantic weekend or a shopping trip.
138,531,Apr 2 2007 	Great!	Stayed one night this weekend. Great hotel which has been recently refurbished. The staff are extremely efficient and friendly. Our room was good and very clean although it did not have a great view - we were hoping for a view of Green Park and on reflection I should have requested this when booking.One disconcerting thing though - there was a mouse trap in the room! Luckily we didn't find this until the morning otherwise I am sure I would have had a sleepless night. No evidence of a resident mouse were found either though - thank goodness!!!
139,531,"Mar 29 2007 	Wonderful experience	Just returned from London and the second time that we stayed at The Athenaeum and, once again, we were very pleased.Location is wonderful, rooms are comfortable and all of the staff is more than willing to help with any request or need. We accidently left some papers in the lounge one evening and they were delivered to our room before we noticed that they were missing."
140,531,"Mar 21 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	Booked a standard room for one night through Lastminute.com for 109 (without breakfast). Upon check-in we were offered an upgraded room at an additional cost but chose not to as our standard room was very pleasant and the facilities sufficient for our short stay. Having previously lived in London for years, we didn't care that we did not have a view. The room was modern in decor, the bathroom clean and facilities good although the space was rather small. We enjoyed drinks in the bar during the afternoon and late evening. Pricey as expected. All staff we encountered were very pleasant and professional. Our only gripes would be a lengthy check-in (perhaps because of booking through Lastminute.com), our double bed made from two singles was uncomfortable in the middle and the unpleasant strong lemon smell on our fourth floor. The location is fantastic. This hotel warrants a good 4 star. It is certainly not a 5 star. We would definitely return."
141,531,"Feb 26 2007	Disappointed	Booked for one night whilst visiting London to see Sound of Music. Was originally going as a couple, but my wife was ill so we changed the booking from one room to two so my Daughter could go with me instead. Changing the booking was great, I had booked on line with Airmiles for our room, I rang the Hotel direct for the second room and they were excellent in helping us out and gave a great rate.Arrival was excellent, particularly the porter staff, they took the car away, sorted the bags etc, but the the reception and bar area are so small! We went for a quick drink and were asked to sit down in a very smokey smoking area and left for ages until our drinks were brought. A nice Oriental girl was doing her best but other Staff were disinterested.We went to the rooms which were fine but struggling to be five star, we have stayed at the Landmark in London on several occasions and that is what a five star should be!Went out to our Show, came back in at 11 and the bar may as well have been shut, very little ambience or character and this on a Saturday evening.Sunday breakfast very disappointing - had to wait a long time for a table (again in the smokey bar area) and then when eventually taken to table had to wait ages for food. Generally service for the whole meal was poor unfortunately and definitely not five star, the staff whilst friendly were struggling to cope. To sum up, we shouldn't have booked this Hotel, knowing the Landmark and how excellent it is, but we got a deal through airmiles and let costs rule us by mistake! We won't make this error again."
142,531,"Feb 8 2007	Very good stay but 1 star too many	We booked this hotel as a Top Secret deal on lastminute.com and got a standard double room only for 4 nights for 590. This was 50% less than expedia's price so we felt we were getting a bargain.Reception/lobby area is relatively small and it has a boutique hotel feel about it when you first walk in. We checked in early and our room wasnt ready, however the receptionist personally escorted us to a different room and explained all it's facilities. Unknown to us she had upgraded us to an executive double (ED) instead of our standard double (SD). The bed in the ED is a huge king size and was soo, soo comfortable. I note some American reviewers felt the rooms in this hotel (and London hotels in general) are too small (much of that probably depends upon what they are used to in the US) but I felt the ED room was very spacious with a sitting area at the window; TV &amp; DVD; broadband internet; good air con and a large built in wardrobe. The upgrade was much appreciated as we discovered the SD rooms face inwards in the hotel (i.e. your window will likely look out upon a brick wall and service pipes) whereas the ED rooms have views looking out over Green park or Down Street. ED rooms are also MUCH bigger. The extra cost for these rooms is worth it. The bathroom was reasonably sized with all necessary facilities. The bath itself was very small (you cannot stretch out in it) but the shower was extremely powerful with plenty of hot water. The concierge service is first class. We dealt with Duncan who was able to answer any question and provide all sorts of advice to us regarding our trip.LOCATIONThe hotel is ideally located on Picadilly next door to the Park Lane Hotel. The Green park and Hyde Park corner subways are only a 5 minute walk in opposite directions i.e. the hotel is between the 2 of them. Knightsbridge; Park Lane and Hyde Park are all only a 10+ minute walk. Harvey Nicholls 15-20 minutes. Upon leaving the hotel and crossing the road you are in beautiful Green Park and after a leisurely 10 minute stroll you arrive at Buckingham Palace on the opposite end of the park. The top half of the Palace can be seen from the park view bedrooms. Leaving the hotel and walking up Picadilly will bring you to bottom of Bond Street in about 8-10 minutes. You can hit Regent Street in about 15 mins and Picadilly Circus in about 20 minutes.Our stay was room only but breakfast is available for 24 per person. We felt this too pricey and were able to eat a hearty breakfast each morning in one of the many eateries near the hotel. Henrys do a full English breakfast for 6. The whiskey bar is a nice way to unwind after you arrive back from a night out. Cocktails are about 10 and bottled bear 4-5  prices which are to be expected in a 5 star hotel. Service again is impeccable. This hotel does lack some of the services you expect to find in a typical 5 star hotel e.g. a swimming pool and a bigger gym; grander lobby area; several bars etc. As a boutique hotel it is a 4 star. I find it hard to classify as a 5 star but the service is certainly 5 star material."
143,531,"Jan 29 2007 	A mixed experience	For our 3 night stay we were given a standard room on the 6th floor. This was clean but very small, in need of refurbishment and the en suite bathroom was microscopic. At full price (in excess of 200 per night) I would have felt ripped off - not what should be expected of a 5 star hotel.Late in the evening on our first night, the (very worn) bedside panel that controlled ALL the lights went on the blink. After three attempts by the duty manager to fix the problem, all the lights blew and we were sat there by torchlight, in our robes. It was now well past midnight and after I declined the offer of a similar room on the same corridor we were upgraded to one of the apartments for the remainder of our stay.The apartment was spacious (separate living room, large bedroom) and meticulously clean, if somewhat dated and frayed in its chinzy decore. There were real light switches, a large flat screen TV, DVD and broadband etc. The kitchenette was well equipped, but much too small for any serious cooking.The staff were courteous and very helpful throughout, but they did fail to explain idiosyncracies of their lighting system.Overall we liked the location and certainly enjoyed our stay, once we had been upgraded, but if asked to pay the full 5 star price - i.e. 450 per night for the apartment, plus English breakfast at 22 etc, there is much better to be had, even in grossly overpriced London.Our 4 star rating is based on the actual experience of our stay, including the upgrade."
144,531,"Jan 9 2007 	Quiet bedroom traditional decor	Stayed here one night just before Christmas in a one bed apartment. The staff in the restaurant were great and the food was good. Our teenager ate it, to my surprise as they normally prefer junk food, and highly recommends the elderflower sorbet and the new potatoes. A full breakfast is expensive but you have a choice of part of the menu at lower cost - and a full breakfast will keep you going all day. Breakfast can also be served in your room but we opted for the restaurant. Ask for herbal tea if you wish although it's not listed on the menu. Our child loved their pot of chocolate. The apartment was furnished with traditional style furniture including desk and dining table. Tiny kitchenette but included a washing machine, we didn't try it out. Couldn't get the 42 inch TV to work but the second TV was fine for us, we didn't bother asking someone to deal with it.By Central London standards the bedroom was very quiet. We didn't have a view but I'd trade that for a good nights sleep anytime. The bed was very comfortable and you can choose a pillow. Shower either wasn't thermostatic or the thermostat had gone. Toiletries great, towels very clean and a good size. I'm not keen on a full size mirror over the bath but also reflecting the toilet. But if that's what turns you on....When we checked out the bill was wrong (too high of course) and the pre theatre dinner shows as afternoon tea, which is confusing. It was sorted out after we left but check the bill carefully. This hotel has a great location, the beds are large, comfortable and very clean. The food is good and the restaurant staff excellent. I'd definitely eat here again, not quite so sure about staying as the hassle with the bill did spoil a good experience."
145,531,"Jan 3 2007 	lovely private hotel	We were very impressed with our Executive Room we stayed. It was very nicely decorated in blue. The only down side was the toiletries - Neutrogena (yes, Boots sell them). They should change it to more upmarket products."
146,531,"Jan 1 2007 	Could bit a little better	Was taken here by my girlfriend. The location is great, opposite Green Park. I found the room a little small, but it had every thing you could need. It had a few nice touches like a choice of pillows. The bed was very comfortable. I don't think the hotel is really a 5 star hotel. The staff weren't really up to scratch: our bill was wrong and it took a waitress three attempts to get my bar order right (all I wanted was a large bottle of water!).The spa was small, but I thought is was good none the less.As with most 5 star hotels these days, they tell us they really want us to enjoy our stay, but insult us by charging 2+ for a KIt Kat and 4.50 for a bottle of water!"
147,531,Dec 12 2006 	Great rooms	Great rooms - excellent afternoon tea - very convenient location.A place I have returned to on several occasions.Recommend
148,531,"Dec 7 2006 	Consistently Great	I've stayed at the Athenaeum in London four times in the past year plus. First and foremost it offers a perfect location on Picadilly across from Green Park and steps to Hyde Park. You can walk everywhere or hop the tube. Second, the staff (some have been there as long as 30 years) should be politicians because they always remember me (or a do a great job pretending), third the rooms -- while on the medium-small to small side -- are exquisitely clean with some of the silkiest sheets I've encountered in a hotel (along with the perfect weight duvet). Love the marble baths and fixtures. Also like that this is a smaller hotel with an intimate feel as well as the fact I can always find a competitive price online."
149,531,"Nov 14 2006 	Pure Luxury Enlglish style!	The Athenaeum hotel is a gorgeous hotel situated in Mayfair, about five minutes walk from Green Park station and ten minutes from Hyde Park Corner. It differs from some other renowned London hotels in that it has a friendly, informal atmosphere and a welcoming feel, despite its grand appearance and luxurious dcor. The second you walk through the imposing front entrance, the door held open for you by a smiling doorman, you feel instantly relaxed and pampered.A friendly concierge greets you and helped us through to the check in. He showed us to the Windsor Lounge, where afternoon tea and light refreshments are served (evening meals are served in Bullochs, their restaurant, which I have tried and also heartily recommend for a special occasion). The Windsor lounge is furnished with big, comfy armchairs, squishy sofas and tables. Its decorated in warm, earthy tones and is a lovely place to relax and unwind. The egg mayonaise sandwiches are a delight, but my favorite is the chicken tempura with a curried dipping sauce. I hope that never vanishes from the serving menu!"
150,531,"Oct 11 2006	excellent boutique hotel	I recently stayed at the Athenaeum hotel and was very pleased. The location is ideally located a few blocks down from the Green Park subway station that you can take from Heathrow and a short walk to Buckingham Palace.  The room itself was superb. There was a very comfortable bed with pillow valet (you can choose what type of pillow you would like such as tempurpedic, buckwheat), heated towel racks and excellent water pressure in the shower.  Also greatly appreciated was the jacuzzi tub downstairs and steam room. There is also a small gym that has treadmill, elliptical trainer and row machine. There wasn't any street noise, but you could sometimes hear hallway noise, but it wasn't a problem since it seemed like most of the clientele was older and there wasn't a lot of in and out traffic during the middle of the night.  I will definitely be staying there again!"
151,531,"Oct 10 2006 	1 star too many	I stayed at the athenaeum for 1 saturday night. I booked to relax in my room, watch a few DVDs and be near a restaurant i was dining in that evening. Reception staff were happy and friendly, I turned on my usual charm and asked for an upgrade as i am a travel agent, without even the slightest hesitation i was upgraded to a large executive room overlooking the park. I was shown a standard double by the guy who took me to my room as i mentioned that if this hotel was nice enough i'd reccomend it to my clients. There is this habit in 5 star hotels where the staff take you to your room and show you how everything works and where everything is ( insulting your intelligence comes to mind ) and then they hang around waiting for a tip, but not this guy, off he went when he was done and that was nice. Do not stay in the standard rooms, there is no little sitting area and they are pretty small with horrid views.The executive room i had was only 'okay' . The room had everything i needed, DVD and Cd player was great and the pillows are the most comfortable i have ever come across. The bathroom was dull and average, could do with refurbishing. There were things scattered around the room that had price tags on them - an umbrella for 50 in one corner of the room and a hotel teddy bear by the bed for 25 and so on. ( strange , i've never come across this before at a 5 star hotel )This hotel is trying hard to be a 5 star hotel but falls a star short. firstly the bar here is actually the lobby and tiny. the restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner has the weirdest decor but serves a great breakfast. ( at 24 per person, i wouldn't think they would dare to get it wrong ).the location is on a busy piccadilly but 10-15 minutes to all the action.I would actually reccomend this hotel but not to anyone expecting a 5 star experience. I'd place this hotel at the better end of the 4 star range."
152,531,"Sep 28 2006 	A great choice!	We recently stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon and after a year of hectic planning, were so grateful to stay somewhere we felt not only accommodated, but well taken care of. From the congratulatory welcome gift upon our arrival to the concierge with a wonderful sense of humor and desire to help make our stay in London memorable, we felt as though anything we needed was already anticipated. The hotels location in close proximity to Buckingham Palace, Green Park and the Underground made for an easy orientation to exploring London. Upon return, we even received a hand-written thank you letter from the hotel manager. Definitely recommend!"
153,531,"Sep 3 2006 	Good location but expensive	We stayed in two apartments affiliated with the hotel in the building next door. Apartments have all hotel services included with the bonus of kitchenettes and living rooms. We found the hotel location to be good, with many restaurants and interesting shops in walking distance and a bus stop right near the hotel (at the Hard Rock Cafe) which was a convenient way to travel to the South Kensington museums. Most theaters were in walking distance, albeit a long walk, which turned out to be a godsend when finding evening taxis proved impossible one night. The hotel and apartments had good AC, which was wonderful during London's broiling heat wave. We ate several times at the hotel, both room service and dining room, and were pleased with food quality and service. Housekeeping was good, and would even wash any dishes we left in our kitchenette. We also liked the bathroom showers --- they worked well. Negatives? Well, the fussy British decor in the apartments was not to my taste. Apartments differ in style and we drew two with Victorian floral drapes and such. Not my cup of tea. But for someone else, that look might be perfect. The elevator in the apartment building was small, able to hold only a handful of passengers. We often chose the stairs, even though we were quite a few flights up. Overall, the hotel seemed awfully expensive, even at the special pound for dollar rate we paid. Also, and this is a minor point, the bathrooms are too small to have towel heaters in them. Several family members had minor burn accidents on the heaters --- nothing serious, just annoying. Finally, we were disappointed with the very small size of the kitchenettes. Way too small to do any cooking of consequence. Even breakfast was hard to produce in such cramped quarters. The appliances could be tricky for Americans to figure out too, but to me that's part of the fun of travel....All in all, I would stay here again, especially if I could get a good discounted room rate."
154,531,"Aug 16 2006 	its ok	well, nothing really wrong with the hotel but was bit dissapointed as it was listed as 5 star. the side view of the hotel is very rundown and looks a bit 70's office block! still the room was in good condition but quiet small. it was pleasant but didnt offer the five star polish which was dissapointing. it was our first wedding anniversary and we stayed at the peninsula hotel in new york for our wedding and so i wanted to recreate that glamour for our annivesary and it didnt really come off for us. i think i agree about the lack of true 5 star hotels in london. the prices are simular though! dont order breaksfast it was awful. presentation was lovely but american pancakes looked and tasted more like burnt hash browns. i got the strong impression it was cooked in lard! 44 for breakfast. for two. 8 for a sandwich!!!!! even i have moments of madness and order these things but the quality of food is just not present. bath robes where terrible quality.so in conclusion, friendly staff, good location, clean but lousy food and dont expected it to be five star quality"
155,531,Aug 8 2006 	Great Hotel!	Perfect location at a very reasonable price if you book in advance with Expedia. Make sure you get a room looking over Green Park! Great bar! Highly Recommended!
156,531,"Jun 15 2006 	Good for the business traveller	I stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel for one night due to business in London. It offered an average tariff for the area (230) The hotel was clean, well lit and fragrant smelling. The lift is tiny and since there are 10 floors you may wait a while. I had a standard room on the 6th floor which was very comfortable. I liked that it didn't have the usual awkward narrow entrance into the room. The decor was reasonably neutral and the window quite large. Despite being on the main road, it was totally quiet - good sound proofing I guess. The hotel offers a &quot;breakfast to go&quot; service which I found very useful. All the staff where warm and friendly. I would definitely choose the Athenaeum again, although I felt underdressed in my office attire next to the glamourous tourists I met in the tiny lift. The bed and the bathroom in the standard room are too small for 2, but for me by myself and being only 5ft 5in, it was perfectly fine."
157,531,"May 18 2006	Good experience at the Athenaeum Hotel	The hotel was located in a very central location and well within walking distance of an underground station. The rooms were quite a bit smaller than I expected, though still functional and comfortable. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was extremely helpful and attentive. Be warned that the hotel is currently undergoing renovations and some ammenaties may not be available. The lift can be slow and many times we found it quicker to take the stairs up to our room on the 4th floor. The one main drawback: both the water pressure and temperature fluctuated during each shower I took at the hotel. All in all, I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again."
158,531,"May 4 2006	Have to agree with the last opinion on this hotel: it is NOT a five star	It is an adding-on review on the last review on this hotel. I am writing this, especially for those, who have no idea of this hotel (since it is not well known, but claims to be a five star one) and are sort of made to stay at this hotel with expectation for a five star hotel. If so, I would not recommend this hotel. We did not intend to stay at this hotel at all, but as it was during the easter holiday, and all other hotels we were looking were booked out. Our travel agent recommended this from a catalogue (adding he had never heard of this hotel) as being the only available one at that time. We traveled with our little baby, so class and comfort were very important. We paid about 220 Euro per room(around 170 BP), stayed five nights there, so at the end it was not that pricy, especially after having known this hotel. If the quality of the hotel in terms of the service, staff etc was up to the claimed level, the money was certainly well spent, but it was not. As described below, it was not that clean, old and shabby. And the staff were - compared with my experiences at Ritz &amp; Marriott's - far away from the five star. One example from many: our neighbours were quite loud throughout the night (they were fighting all the time) and we found that very disturning, but were so polite, so just hoped that they would calm down. Well, even the last night of our London trip, where we had to get up 5 a.m.next morning, they were fighting so loud that we could not sleep. So I called the reception and brielfy explained the situation. Guess what happened: the young lady did not know what to do and asked me instead &quot;so what can I do for you?&quot;. There were some elements of five star hotels, e.g. morning newspaper service, but either you are a five star or not. In my opinion, it is not a five star. Perhaps 3+. If you find a real pricy room and do not mind about the class much, then go for it (the location is quite good), but, for me personally, I do not think we would stay there again, even at a much lower price."
159,531,"Mar 29 2006	Not a Five Star but Good	This hotel is not a 5 star, as last minute or any other providers claim. 4 star +. I paid 103 for 1 night which was pricey because it was just me. I had a ball in London that night.This high rating comes mainly from the service. The staff, especially in the hair salon &amp; the doormen (Jim and an Australian man) are wonderful. However, the Irish concierge is rude. Wonderful too is the location opposite Green Park and behind Park lane. You can also walk to along Picadilly, to Mayfair market or go shopping in the Oxfor Circuis area.The reason it is not anywhere near 5 star is that its just too shabby and small. It needs an upgrade. Honestly ask yourself, when you are stuck in the small elevators; devouring a stale, over-priced high tea; sampling a lunch in the half-empty restaurant; using a spa without a pool and with the sauna not working, and an unattractive, relatively run-down and 1950s decorated building: is this really on a par with Claridges or the Ritz ? However, its probably cheaper so I'd say, if the price is right, go for it!Contact me at chriseng30@fsmail.net for further questions."
160,531,"Mar 22 2006	Great Hotel	We stayed 2 nights at the Athenaeum Hotel on a recent trip to Europe. The room was very nice, very spacious and had a comfortable bed. The staff were helpful and ready to please. Great location, easy access to the 'tourist' type activities. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
161,531,Mar 20 2006	Wonderful Hotel	We booked on lastminute and got a very good rate. We knew in advance that the first floor was being refurbished but it did not really affect us (there was work going on at the weekend but very little noise in any case). The room was beautifully decorated and had a stunning view over Green Park.We didn't have breakfast but went to the Spa in the morning. Very nice way to start the day. Looking forward to having an excuse to returning to this hotel.
162,531,"Jan 27 2006	Made our weekend special	This was one of the most friendly and accomodating hotels I have ever stayed in. Although we were disappointed that the sauna etc was shut down, we were upgraded to an executive room, sent a bottle of champagne for my partners birthday and given breakfast the next morning. All of the staff were efficient and friendly and ensured that our weekend away was a very special one. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
163,531,"Jan 19 2006	Lovely!	Stayed four nights in November, and I must say it was a very welcome change to the shabby Bayswater hotels I usually end up staying at in London. Booked through lastminute.com, at a great rate. Got free upgrade to executive room because of boyfriend's Birhtday. Lovely spacious room, bed ditto. Adored the heated towels in the bathroom. Spa was gorgeous, though small, but no one seemed to use it, so got it all to ourselves! Great location, central but still quiet at night. Only minus is I never saw anything to the promised Champagne upon check in..."
164,531,"Jan 17 2006	Great value	Booked through LastMinute and got a great deal. The room was lovely, very modern with lots of gadgets e.g. remote controlled curtains. Bed was extremely comfortable. Service was excellent. Don't be put off by the external view of the hotel.Only downside was that there is a refurb of the ground floor going on which means the jacuzi/sauna etc are closed (spa treatments still available) - no noise from the work though (at weekend at least) but it is expected to last 3 months."
165,531,"Dec 30 2005	Super Christmas break at the Athenaeum	Had a wonderful stay at the Athenaeum. As with other reviews we booked through lastminute and paid approx 80 each, for both room at Athenaeum and top price theatre tickets at the Palladium. This turned out to be superb value. The hotel is in a great location on Piccadilly and has smart decor. Our room was maybe on the smaller side, but was immaculate, with a huge comfy bed, plasma tv/dvd and marble bathroom. The room service breakfast is extortionate(see below!) but we ate out so cannot comment on its quality. The small whisky bar is also expensive (35 for 4 large gin and tonics)but has a homely atmosphere and somehow feels like it's worth paying the extra(friendly, knowledgeable barman and really lovely glasses etc). I would definitely go back to the Athenaeum and happily recommend it."
166,531,"Oct 10 2005	Fantastic deal!!	I booked this hotel as part of a surprise birthday night out for my boyfriend. I got a fantastic deal on lasminute...only 99 which is fantastic for a 5* hotel in Picadilly!I travelled up to london the night before his birthday with an over night bag (he wasn't aware that I had booked us in a hotel!) and the hotels reception were fantastic and agreed to put our luggage in a safe room over night.We were really pleased with our room , it is exactly like the pictures shown on this internet site. Very large, comfy bed, marble bathroom with fluffy robes and slippers...fantastic.As the person said in the review before, breakfast is a little pricy -I think for both of us the breakfast which we had ordered to our room was about 45. It came on a huge trolley and had a selection of fruits, yoghurts, cooked breakfast etc but was really worth it.We had a lovely stay, the price was great and we would come back!"
167,531,"Oct 6 2005	Good deal from lastminite.com	Got a good deal from t'Internet - 130. Hotel location on Picadilly is great - right next door the the Sheraton. Check in was swift and friendly and room we were given was great.I think we got an upgrade to the &quot;normal&quot; discount rooms though, as we checked in quite early. We were on the 5th Floor to the side of the hotel. Good size room with excellent bathroom. All mod cons - including Digital TV, In room broadband Internet etc.MY Wife had breakfast in the hotel - quite pricey at 21 - I opted for a Coffee and Muffin from the nearby Starbucks and sat in Green Park watching the birds and squirrels play on a beautiful warm Autumn morning.All in all a good hotel for the money if booked on lastminite.com. Would probably suit the more &quot;mature&quot; traveller rather than a younger person coming to London.Would I stay again? - Yes."
168,531,"Oct 3 2005 	Location great! Hotel above average....	We stayed two nights at the Athenaeum at the end of September. The lobby is unimpressive. The desk staff was cordial, but not really friendly. The complimentary champagne at check-in was a lovely touch! The concierge was wonderful - very funny and helpful! The doorman was great. I misplaced a shawl while checking in, and the manager tried very hard to try to help me locate it, which I very much appreciated. The room was small, but comfortable. The bed was nice. The lights were hard to figure out, as they worked on a remote. The bath was small, but nice. We got an excellent price for the room ($300/night US). I feel that the value was good at that price; the room was adequate and the location was prime. However, at the more usual rate of $500/night US, I believe you can do better!"
169,531,"Oct 2 2005	Perfect place for elderly and wealthy people	My parents sent me to London for five days as a graduation gift. I went there with my boyfriend, I was 20 years old then and he was 22. We probably should have picked a more modern hotel like the St. Martin's Lane or the Sanderson out of the five star category, because the Atenaeum is rather for older people or just for the upper class. Sure, everything was fine, but we felt wrong in this place cause it was too perfect and posh. First we had to deposit a credit card which we didn't have, so we had to give them lots of cash which we actually took with us for shopping, not for leaving it at the hotel all the time. I think a real 5-star-hotel should treat every guest equally, that's what makes it 5-star!The staff looked at us as if we were strangers because we obviously weren't as wealthy as the other people there.Also, the breakfast was so tiny and consisted of only some fruit, anything else we wanted costed a fortune.Next time in London, we will definitely go to an other hotel!"
170,531,"Sep 1 2005	Good location	I recently stayed at the Atheneum for a holiday weekend with my husband. I got a fantastic rate on lastminute for their double room. When we checked in they offered us an upgrade to a larger room, which was 40 per night. The &quot;cheap&quot; was very small although nicely furnished. The upgraded room was much nicer and larger. I was surprised that they offered it at 40 which I think is quite expensive. The bed was very big and comfortable and had two excellent night sleep. The staff were all very friendly, the common rooms were clean and the maid staff nice. Everything was efficient. The hotel is in a great location with Shepard Market very close by.I would recommend it again."
171,531,"Aug 30 2005 	Good but not top	I have stayed a few times at the Athenaeum London over the past three years. Even though I would say it is a nice hotel, it is not fantastic. The location across from Green Park near Hyde Park Corner is good. Try to get a Park View Room, even though you might have a little street noise, it is not too disturbing. The gym, though small, is open 24 hours. However the wet zones are only form 8 to 8 which is a shame. The rooms are not very large but cosy, beds are comfortable, though a bit on the small side for tall people.Breakfast is pleasant with lots of freshly baked breads and fresh fruits.Reception is ok but could be a little friendlier, in particular when it is not very busy. Also the hotel constantly asks you to fill in reviews about the quality of the place, however I never notice that much changes. The place is on my emplyer's corporate list, therefore I return often. However I question the Small Luxury Hotel award slightly having been to other SLH places."
172,531,"Jul 20 2005	Delighted	I made reservations at the Athaneum based on a combination of good reviews on Tripadvisor and a &quot;fair&quot; weekend rate. It is difficult to find a hotel for 4 (my wife and two children, 7 and 9) in London.I did not expect the hotel to be as good as we found it. Check in was personable - though as a previous reviewer wrote - the front desk staff are all &quot;foreign&quot;. The doorman is fantastic - with the impressive skill of greeting me by name every time I came in and out. The one bedroom suite was beautiful. It was a few doors up the quiet side street. Traditionally furnished with comfortable chairs, desks and sofa. The children loved the large flat panel wall mounted TV in the bedroom. The living room had a large modern B&amp;O TV and there was a seperate stereo system with its own remote.5 minutes after checking in the children were brought a basket of games and sticker books.We did not use the kitchen but it apeared to be well supplied.A full English breakfast and impressive breakfast buffet in the pleasant restaurant, was included in the weekend rate.As a bonus - about 20 minutes after arriving, we walked across Green Park and as we got to the Mall, saw a small motorcade followed by the Queen.Checkout was painless with no added surprises."
173,531,Jul 11 2005 	Not bad. Not Great.	Stayed at this hotel for a week in June. Friendly staff. Nice location. My room was ok. Bath was small. Bed was comfortable. Elevators are small. This is not a bad choice if the price is right.
174,531,"Jun 25 2005	Standards are slipping	I have stayed at the Athenaeum many times over the past ten years. I have been a big fan of the hotel. This stay, however, I noticed some significant changes. The front desk staff is now largely foreign, and that leads to some language problems in communicating. They are nice enough, but not as responsive as one would expect. The housekeeping staff, which used to be flawless, is not quite up to snuff either. Some cherry pits which were sitting on a plate in our room were not picked up at turndown, and were left until the next morning. The rooms are well-kept, but in the apartments, the kitchen and the bathroom are beginning to show their age - appliances had some problems and the bathroom is looking a little worn. The kitchen and bath have not changed in ten years. Some elements of the Athenaeum are as good as ever - the doormen and bell staff have been there forever, and they are wonderful, especially James. The concierge staff is good. We had problems with the billing for our room, as they attempted to charge a rate fifty percent more than had been quoted on their website. This problem was cleared up, but made for an unpleasant end to our stay. We have loved the Athenaeum, but they need to get on top of some problems which could lead to the loss of their reputation. For these prices, things need to be close to perfect."
175,531,"May 3 2005	Not quite 5 star	Spent one night in the Athenaeum, got a good deal from Thomas Cook (260 per double). Staff was very friendly and on arrival we were upgraded to an Executive room. The room was spacious, not much of a view (9th floor) but unfortunately it was not very clean: dust all over the place and hair in the bath. Certainly not acceptable for a 5* hotel. Breakfast was OK but again nothing special.Used to stay in the Royal Park Hotel (4*) and I must say that there is not much of a difference between the Royal Park and the Athenaeum."
176,531,"May 3 2005	Excellent Service at the Athenaeum!	I booked the Athenaeum through Last Minute.com for 109. This was booked without knowing the name of the hotel, just general location and rating (5 *). We were pleasantly surprised to find it just 5 - 10 minutes walk away from Green Park Underground (although not 'across the road' as described in their website!). After contacting the hotel regarding an upgrade, we took up their offer of 30 for an executive twin. We arrived early at 10am and our rooms weren't ready (to be expected at that time). John the Concierge practially wrestled the bags off our shoulders - not used to such service! The concierge took our bags for storage and we freshened up in the powder room, just on the first floor. It is gorgeous!! Take a look ladies, step back in time to a really traditional ladies powder room.We arrived back at the hotel late afternoon and was taken to our room on the 7th floor by receptionist, who offered to show us round the hotel and explain the facilities. Unfortunatley we were running late so had to decline. It was a lovely traditional style room with two single beds that were side by side. A bay window looked out onto a side street, and if you looked down the street to the left you could see Green Park. View wasn't an interest of ours, so we were quite happy. There were two chairs and a small table between them. The TV was equiped with CD/DVD player, which was excellent and the optional extra of using the interet at a charge. The room was spotless with gorgeous white duvets, pillows and sheets. The room itself was an ok size - I must say I think the standard room would therefore be very small. Bathroom was nice with two towelling robes and Neutragena toiletries. Fantastic shower as well! The beds were truly a delight to sleep in! The most comfortable beds ever! We didn't use the other facilities in the hotel, so can't coment. Green Park tube is on the Piccaddily, Victoria and Jubilee lines, so it is a good base to move around. We took a stroll through Green Park and ended up facing Buckingham Palace! It was only 10 mins away and we hadn't realised it was so close. I don't know that I would pay the rack rate of 300+ a night for a room, but at a discount, you are really getting more than your money's worth. Beautiful hotel with really pleasant staff and in a great location for sight-seeing."
177,531,"Apr 23 2005 	pampered	Not cheap, but worth every penny. This is a hotel that really does try to 'go the extra mile'. We had a very enjoyable week-end, in a lovely room overlooking Green Park, made even more pleasurable by the overall welcome (a glass of champagne poured as we checked in ), to the friendliness and professionalism of all of the hotel staff we encountered. The hotel itself is very well situated for shopping ( near to Bond Street and Jermyn Street, and not too far from Knightsbridge) and also only a relatively short distance from the theatrical ares and other tourist locations such as Buckingham Palace/River Thames. Breakfast was not cheap but the quality was excellent and if you want to eat elsewhere there a plenty of good locations nearby. Try it!!"
178,531,"Apr 11 2005	A1 Hotel	Stayed here over the easter weekend for 2 nights through a great deal on Last Minute. Upon arrival we was upgraded to a 1 bedroomed apartment in the adjacent street, wow! amazing apartment. The staff at the hotel were great from start to finish, very friendly.Great location across the road from Green Park, 5 mins walk to Buckingham Palace, 5 mins walk to Green Park tube station, and 10 mins walk to Piccadily Circus. A bit pricey in the hotel itself for food and drink, but not as excessive as other hotels of this standard. Breakfast 21 but excellent, room service breakfast 21 as well. Pop into the whiskey bar, 200 different whiskeys to choice from.Would certainly reccomend this to anyone."
179,531,"Apr 6 2005	Still a Class Leader	I stayed at this Hotel on 2nd April overnight. I had a great deal from lastminute where it is currently listed (April 05) as a secret hotel, &quot;5* near park lane&quot;.This is and always has been a stunning hotel, I have been staying here off and on over 7 years. I am not someone who is into loyalty for the sake of it but I keep returning because I cannot find anywhere else to beat it.For 199 inc taxes I got a superb Junior suite with a vast marble bathroom. The room was decorated like a jewel case and was spotless. The rich but tasteful decoration sets all of their rooms off individually and increases the sense of comfort.As ever, even though I checked in early (11am), they had a room for me, just compare that with what happens when you turn up early at a chain hotel. In the past I have turned up at 8am and they still checked me in. All the staff were as ever polite and downright friendly. Food ordered was delicious and promptly delivered. With the current deals you can stay here for the same as a Hilton, even though the class difference is total. It is every way the equal of the Dorchester, and cheaper, and friendlier. It knocks the Ritz into a cocked hat and is cheaper and friendlier, I could go on, but like I said I keep staying here because it is the best I can find."
180,531,Apr 1 2005	Comfortable hotel in top class location	Booked a 2 night stay using lastminute for a weekend break.Good Points:Location - Superb position overlooking Green park/Buckingham palace...step outside of the lobby onto the street and you feel as if you should be wearing your top hat and tails. Central to everything and close to the tube station.Room - A nice relaxing feel with very comfortable bed.Staff - Generally helpful and prompt.Bad Points:Noise - Woken at 4 am Sunday morning by the loud clattering of a truck loading/unloading deliveries outside hotel window in a side street.
181,531,"Mar 26 2005 	Not a 5 star 4 star at best	Just spent an evening here after much fuss. I was referred by a top executive of a Fortune 100 firm and told to book their negotiated corporate rate. The reservations staff rebuffed my oral request and demanded a written one. I complied only to be told that such request must be on XYZ's corporate letterhead or from an email ending (---). My company also has negotiated rates and no hotel we use places such burdens on our guests. After another email to reservations they referred my correspodence to XYZ company's regional travel manager to verify my identity and request. Finally, they reserved me a room. This experience was insulting and I was treated like a second class swindler.Check in was polite and gracious allowing me to have a room before noon. The room was small, carpets dirty and worn, and the street noise was both obvious and annoying. The bed was well made but too short for a 6 foot tall person. The bathroom was small and showed signs of wear. The soundproofing between rooms and the hall was non-existent. A housekeeper opened my door without knocking, twice. Later a welcome letter and piece of fruit was delivered, sadly they were addressed to somebody else.I utilized the concierge once for a dining reference, he chatted away on the phone without acknowledging my presence for 6-8 minutes. The conversation he had was personal and subject matter crude at times. His chirppy voice filled the small lobby and his wannabe snob/&quot;look at me I am so special&quot; attitude was pothetic and irritating. He fancied himself a rich patron not a service provider.The only positive I found in this hotel was its location across from Green Park and the service extended by the front desk. Everything else, at these prices and a 5 star rating, is lacking."
182,531,"Mar 21 2005	This place has gone downhill	I have stayed at the hotel several times over the last 12 months and normally I find the Athenaeum a very pleasant experience, hence my decision to use the hotel for a personal trip rather than the usual business trips. On this occasion I was very disappointed, by some small issues and one particular issue which left me feeling really rather annoyed.Generally the service levels seem to have dropped siginificantly, this time the staff were rude and unhelpful. Not sure if there are different people who work at the weekends, but it was a different experience for sure. I wouldn't recommend this hotel anymore."
183,531,"Mar 14 2005 	First class	Just returned from the Athenaeum and I can't speak highly enough of it. From the moment we entered, the quality was evident. From the concierge who remembers your name to the luxury of the rooms, this is a very good experience for London. Even though the hotel is situated on Piccadilly, the rooms were quiet. Another bonus is that it is only five minutes walk to Le Caprice, an excellent restaurant in Arlington Street (situated at the side of the Ritz) which offers atmosphere, great food yet doesn't break the bank!This is, without doubt, one of the best hotels in London and is worth the expense - or better still, look for a good deal on lastminute.comHighly recommended. When we are next in London this is where we will be heading!!"
184,531,"Feb 23 2005	Prepare yourself...not a rave review !	We stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel on a weekend deal with lastminute for 106 p.p. in February 2005. We were really looking forward to experiencing the 5 Star luxury talked about in most of the reviews...I would have to say the hotel was fine for a weekend break but not deserving of such adulation. We obviously got one of the rooms used for cheap deals, described by a previous reviewer, as it was small and had a view over a back alley. The bed was a real feather bed and was so comfortable but it was short and our feet did hang off the bottom. The location is upmarket but dead at weekends, we couldnt get a beer after 10.30pm and there were no shops nearby for a friend to buy cigarettes.  Checking out on Sunday morning, the receptionist produced a bill for two breakfasts which was something around 35, I think, I was so shocked I didnt really look at the actual figure, I was just trying to work out how a hotel of this standard can allow this to happen. We certainly didnt have the breakfasts so someone had given our room number and got free food. I felt I had to defend our integrity and showed my signature was nothing like the squiggle given by the person receiving the food. It was horrible feeling like because we were on a special rate, we would be dishonest! The couple with us stayed in the identical room above us and had their bag rummaged through and left open but thankfully they had used the safe. The hotel did the job for the rate we paid but that is it! Kensington or Knightsbridge is more suited for a shoppers weekend."
185,531,"Feb 18 2005	pricey but worth it	This is a quiet, sophisticated hotel with a staff that is attentive without being intrusive. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the food excellent. I was there in July and the breakfast buffet included a wide choice of fresh, seasonal fruit--uncommon in big-city hotels in my experience. Deals that include breakfast are best, because the menu price is steep. While this is not an inexpensive hotel, there is real value for the price."
186,531,"Feb 8 2005	Fantastic proper 5 * accomodation	from the moment you enter this hotel you are greeted with a warm welcome.Its not stuffy like other 5 * hotels in London and you are not looked upon like scum if you have jeans on! Would definatly stay again easily the best hotel I have stayed in, in London. 3 minutes walk from Tube station and approx 10 minutes walk from piccadily and 10 minutes from Knightsbridge.Concierge are fantastic and cannot do enough to help.Should be higher up in rank of hotels."
187,531,"Jan 20 2005 	First Class	This is easily the best hotel I've stayed at (Jan 2005) in London. It's small, quiet (despite being on Piccadilly), welcoming, well-appointed and extremely comfortable. Very well worth staying here if you can (currently selling on lastminute for around 120 per night)."
188,531,"Jan 11 2005	Fantastic Christmas in London	Everything was better than my family and I expected. We had a magical Christmas (Dec. 2004) at the Athenaeum. In fact, I wanted to go back to London just to stay at the hotel. This was the first time we had our Christmas away from home but we felt so much at home at the Athenaeum. We had a one bedroom apartment which was perfect for our family of four because it has a completely separate bedroom with a king size bed and a very lovely bathroom. The living room is spacious, elegantly decorated, has a queen size sofa bed and with windows look out to a partial park view, not to mention the giant plasma display that my boys loved so much. In fact, my husband and I were able to go for English Tea twice thanks to the DVDs from the front desk. The petite and adorable kitchen has everything to make you feel like home, including a washer/dryer unit to take care of your daily laundry. I used the washer everyday (note: it is better to dry your clothes on a hanger than in the dryer.) We love having our English breakfast (included in the room rate) and our dinner at the restaurant. The food was exceptional and the service was absolutely outstanding. Donald from the concierge is friendly, helpful and humorous. I just wish there are more people like him at other five-star hotels. The compact gym is perfect for exercise and the rest of the spa facilities is very nicely done. We did make full use of it during our eight-day stay at the hotel. Lastly, I got a lot of help from the reservation staff to plan my vacation via email before we arrived London."
189,531,"Jan 1 2005	a treasure of a hotel	This is a gem of a hotel. It is a small, boutique hotel that has a prime location - across from Green Park, a short walk to Buckingham Palace and Shepherd's Market. It is located in the area of Mayfair which boasts some of the finest shops, art galleries and antique stores. The service was impeccable from the concierge to the waiters in the restaurants. Our family stayed in the apartments, situated next door to the hotel on a quiet and charming street. The apartment was beautifully appointed with fine English decorations, furnishings and draperies; the television in our living room was large with flat screen and offered many options such as internet access and movie viewing. We saw other apartments that had different decore; one next door had a bachelor theme with modern furniture. Tea is an understated tradition served in the living room area with wonderful delicacies that my nine year old daughter Rachel was delighted with! Breakfast was superb with a range of fresh fruits, baked goods and delicious eggs and omelettes. The whiskey bar was intimate and a great refuge for my husband. I also used the exercise facilities, which while small in size, was adequate. The Athenaeum is highly recommended hotel that is small enough to give its clientele superior service and I will most definitely return!"
190,531,Dec 2 2004	Almost perfect	WoW! Why isn't this place higher on the list? I stayed here for one night this week doing some business in London. It was almost perfect. I wanted a place that wasn't full of flowers &amp; chintz. The Athenaeum is as sophisticated and stylish as any hotel in the world - the perfect antidote to an overdose of Laura Ashley. Service was excellent.
191,531,"Nov 17 2004	Five star class	We have stayed at the Athenaeum four times and are heading back soon at the end of November - it is a lovely hotel! We feel at home the moment we walk in the door. The staff are wonderful and everyone remembers us - from the doorman to the maitre d. The facilities are top notch - just how a top class London hotel should be, but without the stuffiness. A great location too - you can walk everywhere. Can't wait to be back on the 26th!"
192,531,"Nov 1 2004	Lovely London Hotel	We stayed at the Athenaeum for a week while in London recently. It was wonderful. The room was clean upon arrival. There were nice touches, such as a towel warmer in the bathroom, good water pressure and consistent temperature in the shower, lights that come on as you enter the room, turn-down service, newspaper delivery and a cute fitness room and jacuzzi with sauna and steam rooms. Donald, the concierge, was most helpful with sightseeing plans and routes. Room service and housekeeping were fast and efficient. We enjoyed a delicious meal in Bulloch's Restaurant and cocktails in the Windsor Lounge. The location was excellent as it was close to the Tube and in a nice neighborhood for walking while not being too noisy or overcrowded. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while in London."
193,531,"Oct 28 2004	A Gem!	I have stayed here twice, they treat you like family. Have not seen any reviews of their apartments next door to the hotel, what luxury and comfort, what space! You won't want to leave. I rented a one bedroom and they kindly upgraded me to a two bedroom because at the last minute, family from Ireland decided to come and stay with me. The manager was just wonderful. Doesn't hurt to have a great Irish concierge who has been at the hotel for years. As someone else mentioned, the front staff are the best in the world. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is top notch also. This is a family owned and operated hotel and it feels like it too!"
194,531,"Sep 20 2004	The Only Place You Should Stay	Simply wonderful. From the moment of arrival to the moment we left, everything was just how a five star hotel should be.We got a fantastic rate of just 99 through Superbreaks AND this made no difference when we arrived at the hotel.We caught the first train to London and arrived at the hotel 9.30 on a Saturday morning but we were shown to our room immediately.To be honest, because we had booked at a discounted rate, we expected this to be reflected in the standard of our room. How wrong could we have been!!The room had views of Green Park, was a good size and most importantly was clean - a rarity in London these days - visit Le Meridien Piccadilly or the Hampshire if you doubt my words.As with all hotels its the little details that matter - a nightly turn down service and a card left on your bed with the weather forecast for the following day!!!If you are looking for a hotel in Central London that dedicates itself to customer service then look no further and book your stay at the Athenaeum and if you're lucky you'll find yourself sharing breakfast with a movie star. We did!!From now on, whenever we stay in London, it will be at the Athenaeum."
195,531,Sep 5 2004	HOW A HOTEL SHOULD BE	Those of you who travel to London regularly know how often you come across unfriendly and amateur staff. The Athenaeum is the complete opposite of this. The rooms are great as is the location. The only thing stopping me staying there on every visit is the lack of availability action within my wallet!
196,531,"Aug 17 2004	Fabulous weekend spoilt by an over zealous front office	Fabulous location, good room, all be it at the back of the hotel with no view and this despite the fact that the hotel was very quiet during our stay. The meal in the restaurant was excellent and the al a carte menu represented reasonably good value. Shame the truffles didn't arrive with the coffee when it was taken in the bar. The bar by the way was excellent and the member of staff absolutely superb.However, a thoroughly enjoyable weekend has been spoilt by an ill judged decision on the part of the hotel to make a charge for mini bar items to my visa card after my departure, something I only discovered when my credit card account arrived, and this despite my having advised upon departure that we hadn't used the mini bar. A letter and three telephone calls were required before my account was credited for the mischarged items and even then an apology for the inconvenience hasn't been forthcoming. I have stayed in many hotels, over many years, in many countries, but never have I had experience of a hotel that charges your credit/debit/charge card after departure without your prior consent. This is just not acceptable and I would certainly expect much better of a hotel with five red stars which prides itself on the quality of its personal service."
197,531,"Aug 15 2004	Great hotel but watch out for the short beds!	Great hotel, good location, fantastic staff.... but, probably because we booked a special offer, we had a very small room. The bed was very short, my husband had to sleep with his feet over the edge ... and he's only 6 foot tall!!"
198,531,"Jul 26 2004	Such a comfortable Place	We have just returned from a wonderful visit at the Athenaeum hotel. From the outside the hotel looks quite drab, but don't let this put you off. The staff and the interior more than make up for a building you would probably walk past without a second glance. The door men are so helpful, down to the point of offering bottled water and face towels to the hotel guests who have been out jogging. Reception are shining examples of how reception staff should be, efficient and friendly. Initially I was disappointed by the room. It was small and only contains a 3/4 sized bath. But the view (of Green Park), the comfortable bed and the airconditioning more than made up for the rooms size. My only complaint? A loud guest in the next room conducting a telephone conversation at 2am and having an animated discussion with other guests in her room. The reason I could probably hear EVERYTHING was that our room had an integral door to her room to enable families to have 2 rooms ajoining etc., I think it would be best to check that your room doesn't have this facility unless you need it. With respect the fact that our neighbour was loud wasn't the hotels fault.We had a fabulous evening meal in the hotel restaurant, it was perfect in every way. All in all a comfortable stay, with friendly staff, who couldn't do enough to help. We will no doubt be back (we will check that the room isn't an ajoining room next time though!)"
199,531,"Jul 22 2004	Wonderful place to stay	I stayed twice at this hotel this year and I really can recommend it. The rooms are wonderful for English standards. They are more spacy than at other hotels. The location is perfect. You can almost do everything by foot if you dont want to take the subway as it can be overcrowded. The staff at the front desk is very helpful, especially Patricia. The breakfast comes in a small buffet style for the continental option or you order a cooked breakfast as well. They have &quot;The Times&quot; delivered to your room every morning as well as the &quot;Daily Express&quot; layed out in the lounge. The lounge is also very cosy and typical English. The concierge is very good and an institution. I definitely would stay there again!!!"
200,531,"Jun 29 2004	The best in town	From the moment we stepped out of the taxi the Hotel felt special, the staff were excellent, the rooms perfect and the breakfast would set you up for the day.I stay in London on a regular basis and will be making this my home..."
201,531,"May 17 2004	Wonderful Staff	I stayed at the Athenaeum from Dec. 27 to 29, 2003. The staff made me feel welcome immediately, which I very much appreciated when I arrived in my jet-lagged state. My room was on the small side, but had all the comforts I expected and a few little luxuries as well. A terrific experience!"
202,531,"Mar 31 2004	Professional comfortable	Good location on Piccadilly; very comfortable; professional and welcoming staff.The bedroom was an example of how 'designer' can sometimes mean 'horrible' ? it was comfortable, fairly recently refurbished, but just not very attractive. On the day I stayed, there was no running water for several hours ? not the hotel's fault, but it didn't help.It's a really nice hotel, and doesn't have that 'chain' feel of so many London hotels. But given the acclaim it's received (five red AA stars, for example), I think I'd expected it to be more special than it actually was."

1,535,"Aug 11 2008 	Good hotel	Good hotel, clean and recently renewed. Close to metro."
2,535,"Aug 6 2008 	Awful Hotel in every way	I am absolutely disgusted with the hotel it was awful in every way, when I entered in my room it was not only tiny &amp; dirty but was too hot and room location was just next to the elevator. You can imagine the noise level of my room. wall is thin and hotel building looks so old, everytime our room vibrate, We felt unsafe, uncomfortable and had the worst night sleep ever.and about the staff they do nothing but only just watch the televison all the time. Avni is the worst hotel I have ever had the misfortune of staying in"
3,535,"Jul 15 2008 	Nice clean and affordable	I've stayed here a few times and in different rooms. The rooms are clean, nice in decor and a good size. Breakfast isn't bad, just a continental so you get cereal, toast, croisants, fruit, yogurt, juices, tea and coffee and some jams and cheese etc... With the location and cost and what you get for your money this is a great hotel to stay at and I will continue to stay there when I am in London."
4,535,Jul 2 2008	Not worth staying	This place is not worth staying in. Service is not existant. Place is reasonably clean but for the cost you can certainly get better. Breakfast is not bad but minimal.
5,535,Jun 20 2008 	Possibly the worst hotel ever	The web site showed it as a clean contemporary hotel. The reality was far from it. First room that we were sent to had not been made up so allocated another room which had a kitchen of sorts and the smallest bed space imaginable. Smelt of microwave meals and was not clean. Walls patched up with filler in places and toilet dirty. Damp wall in kitchenette. It felt like a DSS hostel rather than a 3 star hotel.No air whatsoever in rooms and windows difficult to open. Wife is asthmatic so in end decided we could not stay there and went round corner looking for alternatives. Found the Montana on Gloucester Road that was same price but clean and a proper 3 star hotel.
6,535,"May 28 2008 	Gotta Hate Avni	My husband and I stayed at this hotel recently for 7 nights. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. The previous comments made were spot on.The only thing good about this hotel is its location in South Kensington, which was very close to everything including restaurants, grocery stores and the Underground. However, there are many hotels in this area so you have a lot to choose from.When we checked in, we were told to come back since the rooms were not ready yet. We asked the front desk staff (looks like it's a poorly run family business) if we could get a map of London. We were told that they didn't have any. I would think that most of their guests are tourists and I would think that they'd be able to at least give you a city map. My husband and I had to go down the street to the Marriot to get a map of London and the concierge at the Marriot was a lot more helpful in terms of suggesting sites of interest in the area.We stayed on the 1st floor and as mentioned in other reviews, the walls are very thin and you can hear footsteps of the room above and people's conversation in adjacent rooms. There's a closet room in the hallway which is left open so feel free to grab a fresh and non-smelly towel. The makeshift window covering wasn't working properly. The beds were too small and pillows too flat. I had to leave a note to ask the cleaning person to change our sheets and to supply us with soap and shampoo.The pressure in the shower is good but don't drop the soap because if you bend down you won't be able to get back up and we're average sized people too. The towels stink like bleach so you better bring your own if you're planning on staying at this hotel.The breakfast was ok. The coffee was basically instant coffee put into a coffee pots. The front desk staff were basically non responsive. You ask them a question and they pretend they don't understand you."
7,535,"May 27 2008 	OK for 1 or 2 nights	Has a well deserved bad reputation, as i suppose many other 3star hotels in London.Little difficult to write anything totally original although I do think that some of the reviews are a little forgiving- remember these people are running a business and some things are very easy to correct i.e. very basic maintenance.Pro's are - Location, near tube Gloucester Road and in a nice area, lots of good pubs and restaurants within a few mins walk.Room size ok [ compact] and relatively clean.Bed comfortable.Breakfast ok - plenty of cereals, toast, Fruit, etcCon's - Shower in room fairly pathetic water flow - although Hot.No double glazing and rotting window framesMassive problem with damp in corner of room -which I would Guess runs down the whole side of the Hotel.Some light fittings just hanging out of holes in the ceiling [I think some basic maintenance would sort out ] Temperature is either too cold because of the window frames or too hot if you switch on the radiator which is hit or miss too work -it has a mind of its own and switches on and off on some unknown cycle.Thin walls so can hear all sorts - may effect some but I sleep like the 'proverbial dead' so didn't effect me!I would stay again but max 2 nights and I wouldnt take my 'better half''."
8,535,"May 23 2008 	So-So	Smallest room I have ever seen in my life! No room for the suitcases. No security on our ground floor window, not that we were robbed but it disturbs your peace of mind. The blinds were broken. We had great warm weather while we were there which was great in general but in the hotel room there was no air conditioning and the front desk did not have any fans. We had to go and buy one...so they should have one now! I will say that the room was kept clean and well stocked. The continental breakfast was great! They had: 3-4 varieties of cereal, toast, preserves, fruit, cheese, yogourt, croissants or buns, juice, milk, tea and coffee. The room did have a safe which was nice to put our passports in. TV only had 4 channels. The bathroom was very small with a pedastal sink, stand-up shower and toilet. There was no place to keep your toiletries. No internet facilities. Though there was a cheap enough place just up the road. I would stay here again if I was going solo, but not with another person - it is just too small."
9,535,"May 4 2008	Pleasant enough!	I stayed here with my mother for about a week when we visited London last April. We arrived at about 10 in the morning from the airport, check in wasn't until two but they tried their best to get us a room as soon as possible... I didn't have a good impression of them then, but it was my first time in London and I was tired and cranky so that's probably why. The room was clean, small but that is probably to be expected in that area of London. Everything seemed up to date, I got a good sleep, had some breakfast (served downstairs, continental) and went off to explore London. The closest tube station to the hotel is Gloucester (literally down the street), and shopping on Oxford street, museums, everything, were only a few minutes away so it was a great location. We would return, and a New Zealander in the lobby let us use his laptop, which was nice and I felt comfortable with the people who worked there as well. Most of the recent reviews so far seem bad, so maybe it has changed. I'm not too sure. I'm sure that if you are polite and not too uptight with the staff members than they will give you the same treatment. As for the temperature and the lighting and noise, it definitely was not as bad as other people have said, not in my room anyway. We did change rooms though once, because it wasn't smoke free and my mum is sensitive to that stuff, but it didn't seem to be a problem... they even offered us a bigger room later on in the week."
10,535,"Apr 15 2008 	Not worth the money	I booked this hotel thinking it would be a nice, affordable place in a great area. I knew the rooms would be small but I didn't mind.I actually stayed here over a two week period, broken up by a brief trip outside of London.During the first part of the stay, I was put into a first floor room. The room was roasting hot (even though this was at the end of September and the weather was starting to cool). The ceiling light above the bed was partly to blame, I think, as it was extremely bright. Unfortunately I had to leave the light on as it was the only one in the room other than a dim Ikea table lamp. The television's cable did not work AT ALL, and they did little to fix it except to wiggle the cable and reset the reception settings for the hotel. It would have been nice to have seen the morning news to find out the weather forecast and Tube delays! The shower would leak onto the floor.For the second part of my stay, I was placed into a room on the 3rd floor. This room was cool, thankfully. Probably because the light above the bed didn't work. The TV worked fine in here. The shower door would not close properly so either you left it partially open or you managed to jam it so that you had to practically break the door to get out. Horrible layout of bathroom - the shower door kept hitting the toilet. The hot water would sometimes run out if you waited too late in the evening to take a shower. The power went out a couple of times during the evening, without any explanation from the staff. Couldn't get the radiator to work one day when it became very chilly outside; the staff member who came up to fix it didn't really know what he was doing. Requested someone to open the room safe more than once as it wasn't open when we entered the room, but no one ever showed up when we called.Staff vary from somewhat helpful to &quot;I don't care what your problem is.&quot; You can check out and keep your luggage there, but it will be left in an open area of the lobby and unless you lock it to the bannister or a table, there is no guarantee that it will not walk away as someone won't always be there all the time to watch it.The positives - fantastic, fantastic location near two tube stations and many restaurants, as well as grocery stores, but I wish I had gone to one of the other hotels nearby like base2stay. Neighbourhood is quiet as it's a few blocks away from the noisier main streets. Beds were comfortable, if a bit narrow. Rooms were clean, however there seems to be only one maid for the whole hotel and if the poor woman was busy changing all the rooms for new guests then your room was last on her list. Discovered that she washed our room's dishes in the bathroom sink, without any dishwashing soap. Breakfasts were basic (toast, fruit, juices, tea, coffee, yogurt, horrible croissants), and was a nice way to have a quick bite and save a bit of money before starting the day. Saw people using the wireless internet on their own laptops, but you have to sit in the lobby to do so.Basically, this place is one step up from a hostel but not a very far step."
11,535,"Apr 9 2008 	This hotel is not recommended	room 401: terribleThis hotel doesn't deserve more than 1 or 1.5 * - a very small room, while a medium-sized room is mentioned (on the room door was hanging a floor map where our room is mentioned as a single room)- a very hot room (32C) even tough the central-heating was turned off (impossible to open the window to ventilate the room)  Heating is going though walls with no way to control it - no curtain at the window (nice to wake up at 7am every day due to the heating and the day light while you are on holiday)- the TV cable was cut so impossible to watch TV and the guy at the reception desk just said it wont be possible to fix it before we leave- really small bathroom (impossible to stand next to each other due to the tiny size of the bathroom- small bed (1.80m)- no cap in the sink- no view out of the window (opaque window) - no light bulb at one side of the bed Some positive things though: rooms are clean, breakfast is good and situation is great."
12,535,"Mar 11 2008 	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in	I stayed at the Avni hotel in February 2008 as I thought it was a cheap and convenient way to stay in London and visit friends in the area - however I quickly realised I was mistaken:1) the room was small, freezing cold and the heating did not work2) when I moved the bed 10 cm to one side to be close to a lamp (only one lamp in the room which was very dark) there was so much dirt under the table (would be to impolite to describe what it was).3) I could not lock the door to my room (on ground floor so very uncomforting)4) the front desk staff and the manager (Sunil) were extremely rude and unhelpful when I asked about the possibility of getting another room (which I did not get).5) I checked out one day in advance and despite giving notice they still charged me.All in all a very unpleasant experience which I would not recommend to anyone. Their cancellation charging practices are also unethical and I wish to see them out of business soon."
13,535,"Feb 16 2008 	Do not stay here!	Athough it might seem like an economical choice, I would highly suggest staying somewhere else- Here is a detailed list of the issues:- Front desk was highly disorganiized, they were rude, and missed wake-up calls. Each person seemed to have a different answer, and were not professional or welcoming- AT ALL!!- The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING that the people staying next to you and above you are doing- Bathroom was dingy, extremely cramped, and toilet was nearly non-functional.- VERY, VERY SMALL- The safe was &quot;running low on battery&quot; so we could not store our valuables in it.- I cannot stress enough how awful it was to TRY to sleep there, I hear every step the person above us took, every creek of the bed, and heard every word from the tv across the hall.I have NOOO idea how this hotel got a review higher than a 1, and even though our hotel was miserable it couldnt ruin my trip- book another hotel- I recommend the Kensignton Gardens Hotel- which we moved to after a few night as the Avni."
14,535,"Jan 27 2008 	There's a reason its so cheap....	We stayed here for one night and that was more than enough. Our first room (101) curtain was missing, the TV was wired illegally. The front desk, was rude and disorgansed. Our second room (304) was a little better but had no key so we had to be let in and out by staff. The heating was far to hot. The bed side lamp was broken, so if you reached for it you cut yourself. We fixed this for them by thowing it out. There was previous occupants hair everywhere and the flooring was not fitted properly. The bed was itchy and uncomfortable. Breakfast room/bar was damp, with peeling paint and very poor service."
15,535,"Dec 4 2007 	4 day's weekend on london	Went to London on a weekend and loved the city.We've stayed at Avni's Hotel and find the hotel very good. Well, it's not the Hilton or the Ritz but if you're gonna stay as much time as possible visiting London and all her monuments, you don't need that kind of hotels to stay.The rooms are small but they have all you need. The breakfast is normal, but not Continental one's, with fresh fruit , srcumble eggs ou waffles; well, just enough to stay ok until lunch.The service is also ok. On a 5 minutes walk you have the underground or bus stations. Picadilly circus or Hyde park Corner are 3 statios away.Very nice to stay in london but not within the confusion of the big city.(PB. Lisbon, Portugal)"
16,535,"Oct 22 2007	Dont stay here	Stayed at the Avni Hotel for 3 nights. The best thing about the Hotel is the location just a few minutes from the Tube station. The hotel however was terrible. There was no hot water for 2 nights out of 3 , the lights in the room did not work when we arrived. The room was a box and a dirty one at that, makeup marks all over the walls the paint was peeling off there was no wardrobe just a little shelf with about 5 coat hangers . The description said you had tea and coffee making facilities which we did but there was no Milk and asked every day and never did get any. The staff were not overly helpful and did not want to know when we complained. The breakfast is served in the basement which is damp and smelly again paint peeling off the walls. My advise is to pay a little bit extra for somem comfort. I will not be staying at the Avni hotel again in afraid."
17,535,"Oct 1 2007 	Definitely would NOT recommend to anyone!	Just got back from London and the only disappointment was the hotel - not like the description at all. The room was very small, the sink as well as the shower kept flooding so that you would have to turn off the water between and let it drain. Out of the 7 days, we were without hot water for 3. Every fixture in the bathroom was not level, so you could not store anything in there. Staff are not very accomodating. Rooms do not have a clock/alarm so you would have to rely on the staff for wake up calls. Every time you left the hotel, you would have to hand in your room key, therefore having to wait for a staff member on your return to give you the key back.Only good point, it is close to the underground."
18,535,"Aug 14 2007	Excellent location avoid hotel especially room 201!	I have just arrived back after a 3 night stay at the Avni. Not a good choice, just glad i was out all day and evening. I was visiting my son and girlfriend who had just moved to S. Kensington, but as they only had one bedroom I decided to book into this hotel as it was only a couple of minutes walk away. I was given the key for room 201 but on entering the heat hit you a bit like stepping off a plane in a hot country!. I asked if i could be moved but they said they had no more rooms as they were fully booked. I asked for a fan but they did not have one (not very helpful staff). After a sleepless night I was up and out of my room and the hotel by 8.a.m. each morning, looking rather sweaty just like i had just stepped out of a sauna! Not how you want to look after a shower and putting your make-up on!. The window only opened a little bit at the top so no air could get in. Even the ceramic tiles on the bathroom floor were warm to walk on and the cold water tap ran hot for ages - definately a problem somewhere. On checking in i wasn't given any information regarding breakfast or where to eat it ,so it was just as well i didn't want any . The only + was that it only cost 50 a night, so on a freezing winter's night the room would have been o.k. All in all i would rather have spent 150 in a decent hotel for one night and slept on my son's sofa for 2!!"
19,535,"Aug 12 2007	Nice location terrible hotel	Lock box and curtain were broken in the room and repeated reminders from us and promises from staff brought no resolution. They did, however, read the printed instructions including all of the spelling and grammar errors. They didn't seem to appreciate that I UNDERSTOOD and followed the instructions and that the issue was that the instructions DID NOT WORK.I fixed the curtain myself and did without the lock box. No reduction in price.Staff could not agree on breakfast hours and seemed puzzled when I suggested that they simply post a sign. They did post a sign announcing a 25 pound penalty for loss of a key card. I decided to leave my key card at reception but the card seldom worked to open my room when I returned and retrieved it. The desk person explained me that the card was probably demagnetized by my credit cards of the gates in the tube. Neat trick from the shelf behind the desk. One time THEY lost the key at reception but did not appreciate my request that they pay ME a 25 pound penalty. When I travel, I learn a basic vocabulary in the local language. The Avni staff must recognize that the local language in London is English - my native tongue.This was by far the highest cost and lowest quality and service of any of the hotels where I stayed during almost a month in Europe.I WILL stay in the Earls Court area again, however. Some great restaurants, shops and pubs. Convenient by tube and bus to everything we wanted to see. Just avoid this hotel and other like it. Avni is clearly about making money and NOT about customer service."
20,535,Aug 6 2007 	Avoid this hotel like the plague!	We have just arrived back from one nights stay at the Avni and were throroughly dissapointed with our experience. On entering our room we were immediatly struck by how hot it was (a bit like opening a piping hot oven door). The only air supply to the room was a window that opened to 1&quot; at the max. The hotel had provided us with a fan but this failed to do any more then blow hot air arond the room. Needless to say we did not get much sleep that night. Our experience was so bad that we decided not to hang around for breakfast the next day - this was to be served in the basement of the building. Heaven knows how sweaty it was going to me down there!The only positive thing about the Avni is its location which was brilliant. There are plenty of bars and restaurants in the vicinity which is good because you'll want to spend as little time as possible in your room.
21,535,"Jul 14 2007	Over rated hotel	The description sounded too good to be true, and it was. It was clear the hotel has been remodeled and aspires to be a trendy, boutique spot, it has some issues. My single room was clean, but a little hot box. The one window opened merely as a transom at the top and air flow was blocked by the non-operational Roman shade. I kept the lights off the entire time to keep the temperature down.The ensuite bath (shower) was clean, but the shower didn't drain and i was ankle deep in water. The sink basin faucet was not well attached, and a rubber gasket was clearly out of place on the shower control. The hotel advertised satelitte flat-screen TV, but you could only get 3 channels. The website also features a bar/lounge but it was no where in site.Hallways are very narrow, even for London.This Kensington area is loaded with similar style hotels of all sizes and prices. Not convenient to any tourist locations except V&amp;A Museum. Is close to Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer if you want to grab fresh food.I only stayed here because the price (59 pounds) was the best i could do on same day's notice."
22,535,"Jul 10 2007 	Good hotel at reasonable price!	I recently stayed at the Avni@Courtfield Gardens while on buisness in London. I was really not sure what to expect but was impressed when I arrived at the hotel.My room was on the top floor which was fine for me but the lift only goes to the floor below so had to carry my luggage up one flight of stairs. The stairs were narrow and quite steep so would prove a problem for an elderly or less mobile person.My room was great, really big room with ample sized shower room. My room was well furnished and comfortable, the only thing I could fault was the lack of air conditioning. It was very warm the night I stayed and even with the windows open it was difficult to sleep. Air con would have made all the difference!Breakfast was great, plenty to choose from and staff ensured that everything was replenished regularly.Pleasant and helpful reception staff."
23,535,"Jul 4 2007 	dreadful stay awar	this was one of the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. the room was just big enough to house the bed. the breakfast room was in the basement, a dark room with mould on the walls. keep looking there are far better deals in london."
24,535,"Jun 27 2007 	Strategic location	I think the best location to stay in London would be around gloucester station (Kensington) because the tube line from there connect you directly to lots of places of interest in central London. For this reason i chosed Avni hotel. The hotel lies in quite &amp; safe environment, no traffic sounds through your room's window. The breakfast is included with the room's price &amp; the bedroom is immaculate. It also has elevator (enough for 2-3 persons)However, if you are the type of visitor who love to live in spacious room complete with AC, i won't suggest to stay in this hotel because it wouldn't live up your expectation. The room is tiny and non-AC (eventhough they provide electrical fan). But hey, if you wanna pay below the 100 punds in such good location, I think you have to compromise for certain things isn't it?Do not forget to dine or have lunch in the Singaporean restaurant nearby (&quot;The Bugis street&quot; below the milennium hotel)...they serve tasty &amp; mouth watering Asian cuisine for good prices!"
25,535,"Jun 25 2007 	Ok as long as you know what you are getting into...	Paid roughly $180 per night which is too much for a hotel like this but it's London so what are you going to do. Motel 6 room size. Very simple furnishings. Only a few channels on the TV. Really just a set of converted apartments. Very nice, calm neighborhood but still a lot of noise from cars all night. Simple single pane windows don't help. We were on the mezzanine floor and when people were walking in the room above us it sounded like a heard of elephants. Staff was friendly.Roughly 5 minutes walk from Gloucester Station and lots of restaurants and a few pubs.Seems that unless you are willing to spend LOTS of money on a hotel, this is one of the best you will find."
26,535,"Jun 25 2007 	Good location and clean rooms. Except for...	Stayed at the Avni for 4 nights.Room was clean in a quiet and convenient neighborhood.10 min walk to Gloucester Road tube station.There is also a Tesco supermarket across the street from the tube. This can very convenient and useful if you got a room at the Avni with a fridge and microwave.There is also another 24 hour supermarket 5 mins from the hotel. (except on sunday evenings when they close at 5)Included breakfast was a plus. Serves toast, croissants, juices, milk, cereal and fruits.The room can get hot even on a mild day outside. There is no air conditioning. If you plan to stay in the room in the daytime, look for another hotel as this was was just too warm. If you use the room to sleep only then it could be bearable with the window open (hopefully you get a room where a window does open).Now for the except part....For the first 2 nights we spent it in room 403. The room was small but very clean.In room 402, there were 2 guests who refused to sleep.The first night I was awoken my 2 men having a discussion. It would have been fine if it was a normal conversation. But they seemed to be involved in a heated discussion. They were practically screaming.The walls between the rooms are not very thick. It was as if they were sitting in my room having the discussion.At first I thought they were arguing but they were also laughing so it couldn't have been an argument. Finally around 4 AM they decided to go to sleep after heated discussions among other unmentionable things that would scar any one for life. I complained to the front desk after the first night. But it turned out to be another sleepless second night. They repeated the same actions as night number one. Do these people sleep?A second complaint was made after night number 2. People at the front desk said they were renting the room for 1 month so it was a sensitive matter.Hotel staff should not be giving preferential treatment just because they are renting for a longer period than I was.Does this make me want to stay in the hotel again. Definitely not!!!! Nor would I recommend it to anyone.After further complaints and attempting to check out and finding another place to stay, the hotel staff finally moved us to another room. I would have expected this to have been done after night number one or that they at least speak to the guests in room 402.We did not deserve 2 sleepless nights.If you plan to check into this hotel during the next few weeks, make sure you don't get room 403."
27,535,"Jun 17 2007 	B eware of Room 201!!	Beware of Room 201 and, according to a staff member, Room 301. Through some heating design or installation problem Room 201 and its ensuite become very warm. While this may be ok in winter, in spring or summer, the room becomes unbearably hot. We complained after the first night of our 4 night stay and moved to a much cooler and much smaller room. The housekeeper visited us in the new room to apologise, and told us that the problem rooms were only supposed to be used for one night stays! Which really typifies the attitude of the staff in this recently opened hotel. They just do not care about the customers and take no pride in their work or in their hotel. Do not expect assistance in connecting to the WiFi offered in the reception area or in response to any complaint.Generally the facilities are reasonable quality, although some double rooms are tiny and should only be singles, and the breakfasts are adequate, but the whole place is let down by the staff."
28,535,"Jun 10 2007 	Just ok for a short stay.	The Avni Courtfield hotel is ok for a short stay of 1 or 2 days, but for anything longer I would look elsewhere.The reception area was very disorganised, with luggage everywhere as there was no luggage storage room. It also looked temporary, with computer cables and cords everywhere. The room itself was quite large, with a small kitchenette downstairs, which was quite handy, with microwave, some cups and plates and cutlery, and a decent fridge. Upstairs (with a tiny spiral staircase) was the bedroom and bathroom. The living space was large, but the bathroom tiny. A couple of lounge chairs would have been a welcome addition. The free WIFI was a bonus. The worst thing about some London rooms is lack of airconditioning, and this was quite noticeable. The room was very hot, even though it was a mild day. One window in the room would not stay closed, it kept opening as the latch was broken. We asked if someone could come and fix it, and were told &quot;There is nothing we can do, the maintenance staff are not coming until Monday&quot;. Eventually, someone did come and look and told us that the screw that was lying on the floor was the way to hold it shut, just use that, so it had obviously been broken for a while. They did not seem to understand that it was not secure (there was a terrace outside and people could have come in), and the attitude was essentially, &quot;what do you want us to do about it&quot;. I'm not sure if I will stay at the AVNI again unless the rates are cheap. Overall it was comfortable, close to Gloucester Road Tube, and reasonably quiet."
29,535,"Jun 4 2007 	Not bad for the price	My husband and I stayed at the Avni for 3 nights in May. I agree with most postings about this hotel: it is a good location, rooms are not bad for the price. They did try to go for the boutique hotel thing but seemed to have just missed in my opinion. Lobby is nice enough but hallways are narrow with scuffed up walls, and blue lighting on the stairs could have worked, but somehow doesn't (maybe its the carpet). The elevator is small and slow. The internet did not work in the rooms (you have to go downstairs and sit in the lobby to use it). Breakfast is included and a nice additional value but the music playing from the boom box in the buffet area could be a little quieter and perhaps something other than 90's dance music would be more appropriate at 8am. The reception staff was hit and miss - there was one man who was very helpful and willing to make us reservations for dinner. The other 2 weren't terribly willing to go out of their way to help. Maid service was prompt. Rooms themselves are good size, clean and functional although they could use another luggage rack. Last and most importantly, there is NO Air conditioning so the room was extremely hot and stuffy, even when it was about 50 degrees and raining outside. (We were in a room on Floor 2 so perhaps its a bit stuffier than higher floors). . Overall, not a bad value for money in a VERY expensive city but we wouldn't stay here again."
30,535,"Jun 1 2007 	Avni was Excellent	Hotel was very conveniently located about a 2-3 minute walk from the Earl's Court tube station. The room was actually bigger than I was expecting so that was a bonus. The room was clean, trendy and the twin beds were comfortable, although I think they're slightly narrower than north american twins but I'm not sure. The breakfast rooms were quite nice and it was a serve yourself situation so you could eat as much as you wanted. There was bread, croissants, jam, cheese, cereal, orange juice, milk, water, coffee/tea, fuit and yogurt. People were sitting in the lobby with their laptops using the wireless internet - it was available their but not in the rooms.The bathroom was very clean with all new fixtures and fittings but it was very tiny. Still it was completely doable as long as you aren't extremely umm wide. Sorry but the reality is that if you have a really wide backside then getting on the toilet and into the shower will be difficult - you can sort of angle yourself in though. The toilet access is compromised by the large heater/towel bar on one side and the shower door on the other. You need to keep the shower door open to be able to get on the toilet and then the towel/heater thing keeps you sitting on a bit of an angle. To bad they didn't raise this rack up off the floor a couple of feet to clear the toilet. Access to the sink is great and really, I am by no means small and I was able to manage very well. I'd happily stay here again so just be prepared.There is a small 2-3 person elevator so you don't need to worry about carrying luggage upstairs, so that was wonderful."
31,535,May 29 2007 	Clean Convenient Value	Small Room but has everything you need. Good Location near Gloucester Rd Tube (Picadilly/Circle/District Lines). Great for Heathrow. Very Clean and Breakfast was fine. Lots of places to eat locally. Very good budget option.
32,535,"May 28 2007	Not Bad	stayed at avni in mid May. overall, not bad. good location. 2 blocks to subway which connected easily to most parts of London. We were there 4 days and used the tube a lot. rooms were neat and clean for most part. bring shampoo. they provide little packets that are not much. As mentioned, rooms are small, Bathroom is small too, but workable. daily breakfast was fine. was a little worried about booking this one on line, but after staying there, we were quite pleased. Neighborhood around hotel is nice. walked around the area a few times. nice old church right across the street. Kensington park, hyde park, harrods, and numerous museums in the area too. all in all, not bad."
33,535,"May 21 2007 	Tiny rooms good location	The hotel has TINY rooms. It is at the corner of two busier-than expected streets, so even my fourth floor room was quite noisy until very late (the window did not entirely close). The breakfast was typically non-meat English bed and breakfast fare. On the plus side, the room and en suite bathroom were clean, clean, clean. Maid service was excellent. The staff provided an extra blanket and an iron for our use without charge. And the location, near but not right next to the Gloucester Road tube station, is perfect for getting to all sites without changing tube lines often.As London hotels go, the Avni isn't bad. Not three stars, but solid two stars."
34,535,"May 11 2007 	A Good Choice	You're not going to be impressed by the minimalist front desk or by the size of your room if you're used to North American standards, but everything else is about perfect for the practical traveller. The room was modern, clean, and comfortable. The washroom was clean and simple. The flat screen tv was just the right fit for the room. Hotel location is ideal, as many have pointed out. I found the 24 hour Tesco (Supermarket) across from the Gloucester station to be very convenient to grab snacks and sandwiches to go at very reasonable prices. Check out the Trobadour Cafe on Old Brompton road for a drink or meal--great atmosphere and was frequented by the likes of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix back in the day. There are a couple of things that could be improved. The continental breakfast was adequate, but nothing special and full sized ironing boards would be preferrable to the mini ones that were provided by the front desk.Overall, would not hesitate to stay at the Avni again."
35,535,"Apr 30 2007 	Loved it!	After doing alot of research I decided on the Avni in South Kennsington. I was extremely pleased with the room, service and location. A short walk from the Glouster Road tube, which then can get you anywhere in London with in minutes. So many great restaurants, stores &amp; pubs near by. The neighborhood is safe &amp; friendly. The room is modern and clean with your own bathroom, hairdryer, coffemaker &amp; TV. Having never been to England I relied on pictures &amp; reviews in making my decision. I was so scard I would end up in a small room in a bad area. I was so relieved when I steped off the tube to see a nice area &amp; great hotel. I will definately stay at the Avni if I ever get to England again! I am including a picture of the bathroom so you can get an idea of the size. and also a pic of the hotel &amp; a view from a block away. Have a great trip!Cheers!E."
36,535,"Apr 28 2007 	Great little convenient Hotel	A very reasonably priced room (twin - although I had booked a single) - I paid 55 plus a booking fee for one night. The room was clean and fresh, a good bathroom (slightly small - but had all that I needed) with clean white fluffy towels. The room was good for one - if there had been two people it might have felt a bit cramped. But quite honestly for what I paid it was a bargain. I booked it very late and there was no choice about where to stay and I was pleasantly surprised. I was a single woman staying by myself in London and felt very safe. The hotel staff were helpful and courtious. Great location as it is close to Gloucester Road tube and close to most of the Museums (easy walking distance). I have paid much more at other hotels and been horrified - this was so different. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you for a good experience."
37,535,"Apr 19 2007 	Nice Hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and thought it was great. The location is fantastic, literally a 2 minute walk to Gloucester road tube station, where you can get the picadilly line to Heathrow, or the circle line (very handy for most major sites). The room was clean and spacious, staff were very friendly and helpful. Only one minor complaint, there was no fridge in the room, which we usually like to keep cold water in, but for the very reasonable price, we didnt mind that. . . .Would definitely stay again."
38,535,"Mar 29 2007	everyone is right!	Me and my husband stayed at Avni for five nights in March. All the London hotels reviews on this site were very helpful, so we didn't have many great expectations from our hotel stay. The room on the 4th floor was really tiny, but it had everything you needed in it, hot water, adjustable heating, no noise from the neighbours. All windows in this victorian area of the town (full of other hotels) have single sheets of glass, so it is impossible that the streetnoise doesn't get inside. The TV signal had problems on wednesday and thursday, but from friday it was very OK, don't know why, didn't ask. The staff was very friendly, gave us immediately an extra blanket as we asked for one. Breakfast simple, but plenty of it, good coffee.I think you can't expect much more for the money in any other London hotels of this category! You can stay there too, if you don't have a really bigger budget!"
39,535,"Mar 19 2007 	Not great but the price is right	We stayed at the Avni for two night in March. First of all do not expect a large spacious room. The room we had was about the size of a large closet with just enough room to walk to the bathroom and the bed. It has a old charm to it, but that's about it. The hallways are barely large enough to walk with your luggage. The bed were hard and the T.V had about five stations, with none of them having good reception. We arrived early and had to leave our luggage until we could check in four hours later. When we finally got our room I was amazed at the size of this closet although I did find it a bit funny. We thought we would make the best of it, until we tried to take a shower and had no hot water. We left to sight see and notified the desk about the water and they assured us it would be fixed. When we returned later that evening they told us the hot water had been fixed, however when we tried to take a shower the next morning, we still had no hot water, so the cold shower did not put us in a good mood. We complained again and they did agree to move us to another room that had hot water. We never tried to breakfast so I can not comment on that. The location is in a nice part of town and walking distance to the tube and tour buses. Also there are several nice restaurants and pubs within walking distance. We asked for a wake up call the first night and never did get one. If you are wanting to stay in this area and the size and creature comforts of the room are important to you, then don't stay here. There are several hotels nearby that are more expensive but also nicer. If you just want a cheap room with nothing special and don't care about the size then you may want to give it a try. I would not stay here again but it did give me something to tell horror stories about. Eat at the Hereford Arms. It is a good restaurant and plus I got engaged there yea."
40,535,"Feb 13 2007 	Mainly very good with a couple of niggles...	Booked this hotel for its location and stylish look - boutique, no frills. It is walking distance from the South Ken museums, easy to find, close to the tube, in a quiet and 'upmarket' part of town. The reception staff were friendly and helpful, let us check in early, and the room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and shower good, everything we needed for the night's stay was provided. We had a bit of a laugh about the beds which were on casters and kept rolling around the room uncontrollably when we sat on them! Glad to say they behaved themselves when we slept and were very comfortable, with fresh clean cotton sheets.Our biggest 'niggle' was the TV, which was a state of the art lcd flatscreen but had a terrible signal and there were no watchable channels! The other niggle was that the breakfast croissants were a bit past it. Apart from these fairly unimportant things I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very good value stay in central London."
41,535,"Feb 10 2007 	Fantastic value for money and really not that bad	When i was searching the net for a hotel to stay in for myself and my boyfriend i began to panic that i wouldn't find something nice enough for less than 100 each, but then i stumbled across the Avni Hotel. The pictures and the information on their web page were impressive and instantly attracted me as well as the amazing price of 30 per person per night, including breakfast!!However, when i read some of the reviews i was quite worried about oing ahead and booking a room. Despite this i decided to book because it was such good value for money and i was not let down. The hotel was easy to find and in a perfect location, with amenities and the tube station just a few minutes walk away. The natural history museum, amongst others, were also just down the road. The entrance was clean and contempary and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Initally we were in a double room on the 5th floor but moved to the 3rd floor. May i stress that this had nothing to do with the size of the room it was due to the room being uncomfortably hot. The window was very small so we were unable to get much ventalation. But, when we asked the staff if it was possible to move rooms they did so straight away and although it was a twin room it was perfect in size and comfort. The only problem with the room we found, was that the door to the bedroom caught the bathroom door and this made it difficult to get in and out. But the bathroom was clean and just the right size. Yes there was noise from outside but it is London and is to be expected!! We did find that we could hear noise coming from the other rooms but we were so tired from sightseeing all day that we had no problems getting to sleep, especially because the beds were so comfy!!! Breakfast was good, with a choice of cereals, fruit, crossiants, toast and yoghurts as well as fresh fruit juices and tea and coffee. There was more than enough to fill us up and we couldn't complain becuase of the price.Overall, the Avni was very comfortable and in a perfect location that was easy to find. The staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms were contempary and had a very modern feel to them, and were just the right size. Although, the hotel has been recently renovated there was evidence of some damp in the bathrooms and down in the basement where breakfast was served but this should not put anyone off. At the end of the day it is difficult, near impossible to find a good hotel in London, with breakfast that is such a good price. Me and my partner will definately be staying there again and have recommended it to our friends and family."
42,535,"Jan 31 2007 	Anvi Courtfield	I stayed at the Avni for 2 nights in late January and I think my review is probably going to contradict a lot of the other reviews both with good and bad points! I'd also like to stress that a lot of the gripes in my review are either down to personal preference or are circumstantial and not necessarily a criticism of the hotel itself.Firstly, I'd like to say that this hotel's location cannot be faulted. It's in a respectable, safe area with excellent amenities and is only 5 minutes walk along pleasant streets to Gloucester St tube station which is on Central and District lines &amp; links directly to the Gatwick Express via Victoria. There are restaurants, supermarkets and many attractions are 5 -10 minutes walk away including the V&amp;A, the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum &amp; the Albert Hall.The hotel itself had a mixture of good and bad aspects in my experience.The reception, whilst stylish, looks very makeshift and temporary, (which is partly to do with the design of the desk). I know the reception desk shouldn't matter but first impressions count and despite the desk being made of marble, it looked like it had been placed there 'just for now' and it's not a good look with pc wires trailing and staff being quite so exposed.The staff on arrival were helpful, we arrived an hour early and although a room wasn't available, we were able to leave our bags at reception and return later in the afternoon.The room we were allocated was on the 3rd floor and I didn't find it small at all. I thought it a perfectly adequate size for a double room, although I can see how guests staying for more than a few days may struggle with the storage space. The rooms are decorated in a clean, simple, stylish manner with neutral colours.The bed was far too soft in our opinion and we both woke with sore backs on both mornings, but I guess bed firmness is a personal preference! The bed only had 3 pillows between the two of us and only a sheet and one blanket which didn't seem enough bearing in mind it was January in the UK. Perhaps spare blankets and pillows on top of the wardrobe might be an idea in colder months?In saying that thouhg, the heating was a bit too efficient and more than made up for missing blankets!The heating controls weren't the best and a guide to using them would maybe be helpful for other guests. The room was uncomfortably hot until, on the 3rd attempt we worked out the combination of valves to be turned to switch it off. The room was clean and well decorated, although our panel tv had been put on the wall squint and had a terrible picture on 3 of 5 channels. We didn't bother to complain because we were out most of the time, but in retrospect I wish we had so that other guests might not be bothered.Bathroom- it was clean, towels were clean, shower gel, soap and shampoo were provided - no complaints.The one thing that was a major problem for us was the noise in the room. No noise travelled from either side, presumably due to thick walls, but the noise from above was absolutely awful, especially because we had the misfortune to be below a 1am arrival with insomnia and a furniture rearranging obsession! There is also a lot of noise from the street but that's to be expected in London. I suggest earplugs for any future guests who are less than the deepest of sleepers.Breakfast was nice enough, fresh fruit, 3 types of cereal, yoghurts, sliced bread for toasting and croissants which weren't the freshest I've ever tasted but perfectly edible. Coffee, tea, milk and preserves also available in a spacious breakfast room.At the end of the day I have very mixed views about this hotel, as I say the location couldn't be faulted, the staff were helpful and generally friendly and a lot of what was wrong with my visit could be down to the room we were given and the guests there at the time. However, I do feel that a lot of things just weren't quite right and while you get what you pay for I'd be tempted to say that, in some aspects this hotel is verging on a 2* and not a 3* - hopefully the flaws will be ironed out as the hotel develops, it's not been open long and it could be a great wee place if the little things were looked at."

1,541,Oct 21 2009 	In the middle of nowhere	This place is not a hotel ... not even a motel. It is near Acton Main Line station which is not on the main tube map which caused problems trying to find it the first night. Then on Sunday we found out that trains did not go from that station. The only other option was to walk 15 min down the road to Action Town station. The rooms were small and the bathroom was even smaller. There needs to be a shower mat as when your taking a shower water goes everywhere. They only gave us half a toilet roll for three days. The mattresses on the beds need to be thrown out ... we could feel the springs and it was three very bad nights sleep. The sheets were clean but there was only a very thin blanket on the beds which meant my father ended up sleeping in his clothes as it was so cold. The radiator didn't work and the TV only picked up three channels. We didn't try the free breckfast for obvious reasons.
2,541,"Oct 6 2009 	Not the best ... really budget	This hotel ok for it's price. Receptionist is friendly and helpful. Rooms definately BUDGET.Breakfast is AWFUL.Orange juice is watery (wouldnt even called it orange juice).They say eat as much as you, want but when you ask for extra toast they ask you to pay. I also had an experience where I came down in the morning and found an illegal worker (assuming he is illegal as he cant speak english properly and he's extremely rude) was sleeping on the kitchen floor beside where breakfast is served in a chicken shop.That aside overall the hotel is not bad for the price."
3,541,"Sep 20 2009 	Hard to discrive but not recommend for your allergies	We hadn't a clue how far was it from the Tube. But we found it.The Hotel - The staff were great. The room was ok, but it needs more cleaning. Location: ok it's far away from the center, but have good markets/grossers nearby.Transports: Was I already said it's far from the Tube, but the 266 plus the 70(? or 50 can't remember) can take you to Notting Hill/Portobello Road or White City Station (Tube).If you want to go clubing al night, I wouldn't recommend it. It's to far away from the Soho (1h 30m).If you have allergies, bright all your medicines... It needs more cleaning."
4,541,"Aug 15 2009 	A to Z isn't the hotel descripted	It's far from the centre, it takes between fourty and fifty minutes to reach picadilly circus and oxford street. The tube is far, a half-hour walk, but there is a 24 h bus near at the door that leaves you in Hammersmith, where you can take another metro or bus to the centre. The room was very dirty: the carpet with hairs and dirt, the walls and the old bedspreads with unidentified stains. Only sheets and towels was good. Broken and insecure door. Views were blocked by the bright sign of the hostel. Under our window, a shelf with garbage and used underwear. A lot of noises at the street, we had to buy earplugs to be able to sleep. The small bathroom was horrible, to take a simple shower was an odyssey. Showerhead was fixed and very high, the watter keep falling far and to be under the watter I had to go beside the toilet. Service was not very good, two days they gave us clean towels and only one day of seven they made our beds. Our garbage cube wasn't cleaned any day. Breakfast was in a kebab communicated with the hostel by a backdoor. To arrive, you have to go by one corridor with a full of towels and dirty sheets on the floor. Breakfast was served on the same kebab with the removed shutters. Wasn't juice, but it was water with taste of orange, cofee or tea, two toasted per person, a bit of marmelade and a misery of butter. If you want more butter, they said no. Definitely, A to Z was a deception."
5,541,"Jul 14 2009 	The worst hotel I've ever stayed in	The rooms at this hotel are tiny.. The sheets were not clean, no tea/coffee making stuff.The best bit is when I went to get breakfast it was signed down a corridor wher you end up behind the fryer of the fried chicken place next door. It stinks of stale fat and they expect you to eat in there. Needless to say I gave it a miss. It wasn't that cheep and its in the middle of nowhere. You would be better off slleping in the car"
6,541,Aug 16 2009 	Epouvantable!
1,545,Simple hotel good location	Overall the hotel provided exactly what we needed - a base for a 2-day sighting seeing trip around London. The location was good since it was right near the Earl's Court Station that allowed us to get everywhere we wanted to go. Otherwise there was not much near the hotel.The room was actually bigger than anticipated. It was very basic though. Only negative was that the one women at the desk wasn't helpful at all with any of our questions. Would recommend for a basic sightseeing stay.
2,545,"Nov 21 2009 	Good hotel GREAT value	I just spent almost 2 weeks at this hotel on a solo leisure/shopping trip, and I don't have many complaints! It's an incredible value in such a pricey city and as others have mentioned, it's access to the Earl's Court tube station is it's shining glory. The area has a nice neighborhood feeling and there are many amenities within a few steps from the hotel (drugstore, grocers, post office, atms, pubs, restaurants, convenience stores, stationers, internet cafe, etc etc!). The room was nothing special... quite drab and outdated, but it was very clean and everything was in working order. It was small, but I had plenty of room to move about and put my belongings. Oh, and that tea kettle that boils water in seconds was a lovely thing to have in the room. I never saw any insects or pests, I never ran out of hot water for showers, and whenever I requested anything from the staff, they were very prompt and polite. I was definitely a late riser and the housekeeping staff always took the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign seriously! I also have to thank the gentleman at the front desk the morning of my checkout... I was short 30 or 40 pence for some phone calls I had made from my room, and he just smiled and told me not to worry. Thanks!There were only a very minor complaints about my stay. The main one is the creaky floorboards! I know there isn't much the hotel can do about it, but my goodness was it annoying! I couldn't walk anywhere in my room without a headache. And I could hear everything that was going on in the hallway like it was right next to me, so I inadvertently eavesdropped on many conversations. Although I wasn't in London to watch TV, the couple of channels that were available had a bit of static. The room was always too warm for me, even with the fan and windows open (in the middle of November), and the bed was a bit uncomfortable at times (there was small plastic circles embedded in mattress... I have no idea what they were). Also, the halls were never really tidy... always piles of towels or toilet paper laying around from housekeeping. It never bothered me, but I can see how it might look disorderly to some visitors.Although I was thinking that on my next trip to London I would try to find accommodations with self-service lodging (kitchenette, fridge), to save a bit of money on dining out... I would definitely stay at Barkston Gardens again and give it my recommendation!"
3,545,"Nov 19 2009 	Average hotel in good location	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and overall it is a fair value for money in London. Main benefit is that this hotel is only a couple of minutes walk from Earl's Court tube station, which is very central and you don't need to spend hours to get to main places of interest. Breakfast is also quite good - we had a full English breakfast package, which worked out very well. However the &quot;restaurant&quot; looks very tired and reminds me of an old public canteen. Nevertheless, quality and variety of food is very reasonable. Bedrooms in this hotel overall are not that great. Good things are: spacious room, clean. Bad things - everything looks very very tired, bathroom - although shower works - looks awful, old and very outdated (but still clean). Windows - forget double glazing. Very old and very dirty, can't open them properly - I needed to use a folder to stop it from shutting. Curtains used to be white, but it I think it was a long long time ago, and now they are grey. Floor (and carpets) is also quite bad and every time you walk, it makes terrible noise - which is especially noticeable during the night if you or your kids have to get up.I first thought of rating this hotel as 3 out of 5 because of it's location and room rates. But the more I think about it, the more negatives I find. I would not really like to stay in this hotel in the future - I would rather move away from the city centre, or choose a bit more expensive hotel in the same area."
4,545,"Nov 11 2009 	Excellent value for money	Located just a few meters away from Earls court tube, it is easily accessible by public transport that drops you only a few meters away. Location is excellent, couldn't be better.Even if it is next to a busy road, at night the area is quiet and you can sleep well.Rooms are very big when compared to other same level London hotels with plenty of room to put baggage and be comfortable. Bathroom is ensuite and not very small, the only problem was that water wasn't very hot, but we could manage to have a bath without any problem. Rooms and hotel were clean.Breakfast was nothing special but accaptable with fresh toast, another type of bread, cereals, one type of ham ans cheese, jams, ecc. You can also choose from hot chocolate, tea or coffee, I had the first two, and the two of them weren't good.I definately recommend this hotel since it is excellent value for money, located in the centre of london with easy transport facilities being just a few seconds away."
5,545,"Oct 28 2009 	Completely satisfied!	This hotel was excellent for what we wanted - a real London atmosphere in a great section of the city, at reasonable cost. The room was modest size - no problem for us as we knew what to expect - and charmingly furnished. The bathroom was modern and clean. No problem! The staff was fine, although we had no special requests.Someone who wants an American-type room may not be as happy as we were, it's just a matter of taste."
6,545,"Oct 27 2009 	surly arrogant condescending and demeaning staff!	If your idea of customer service is surly, arrogant, condescending and demeaning staff you will simply adore the Barkston Gardens Hotel. If not, i suggest you run the other way, fast!"
7,545,"Oct 11 2009	Under construction	The hotel was under construction while we were there. It wasn't too disruptive, but it made walking down the hall unpleasant as they put in a new elevator. Our room was okay and very spacious, the beds soft and comfortable, but our bathroom was scary. I say scary because the shower sang, and the tiling was poor, with large gobs of caulk everywhere to fill in gaps.The location was Excellent. From Earl's Court tube station, you turn right, walk half a block, turn left and you are there! It's on the Piccadilly line which makes it convenient to get to and from the airport, or Kings Cross/ St. Pancras train station if you don't have a car. There were also plenty of choices as far as restaurants, grocery stores, bakerys, internet cafes, and a little shopping. ATMs located accross the street from the underground.Breakfast was a nice buffet. Tea and toast plus whatever you can concoct with cheese, rolls, ham, cut up fruit, and cereal."
8,545,"Oct 10 2009 	A good hotel for many reasons	I just returned from London where I stayed for the fourth time at Barkston Gardens.The hotel has a very good position along the Piccadilly Line, just a few minutes walk from Earls Court underground station. The rooms are good enough, not luxurious.The floor makes (terrible) noise and sometimes theres no hot water, but it does not bother me to much. The international breakfast is always the same but contains the basic drinks and food stuffs. The personal is friendly."
9,545,"Oct 8 2009 	Great location!	Great location! I was surprised how close everything was to this hotel. The restaurants, drugstore, grocery store, and shopping was close by. The tube was literally a 5 minute walk. Great location overall. The hotel is an older building, but it does have big rooms and big bathrooms. They need to update the furnitures. The bed was uncomfortable!The hotel staffs were very nice and courteous. Great customer service. I will definitely stay here again. Hopefully, they would have new beds."
10,545,"Oct 6 2009 	Excellent Location	We have just returned from London - our one week at the Barkston Hotel was quite nice. it is very functional, close to all travel, (subway and access to Brit Rail) ,shopping, bank, boots drug store, food, bakeries, etc. We found the hotel basic, &amp; clean and met out needs. The buffet breakfast was well organized and exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff and the staff in general were prompt, professional and responsive to our needs.Our room was on the 6th floor - you should ask for a 6th floor room - the floors are &quot;creaky&quot;. Our room was clean and quite adequate - we were out most of the day and only spent time in the room at night. I will say that the furnishings in our room were a bit &quot;tired&quot; - the carpet and bed clothing need to be updated. The windows are old - but we could open them. We found the room warm and asked for another fan for the room - which was promptly delivered. Lots of hot water in the bathroom- very clean and modern. Lovely huge bathtub.A new elevator is being installed, however, we were never bothered by the noise - they started work around 10 am and finished by 5 pm. This hotel is basic but close to everything you need if you are out all day. Would recommend it and also would stay there again."
11,545,"Sep 30 2009 	Listen to the bad reviews - trust me this isn't a bearable cheap hotel	Seriously: you may see the bad reviews and think, &quot;They're just being prissy, but I'm a real traveler - I can handle a bit of old and in-need-of-renovation, I'm just going to be sleeping there.&quot;Do yourself a favour. Go onto Google: search &quot;barkston gardens cockroach&quot;, &quot;barkston gardens lice&quot;, &quot;barkston gardens bedbugs&quot;, &quot;barkston gardens scabbies&quot;, &quot;barkston gardens rats&quot; and &quot;barkston gardens pests&quot;It's not even that the rooms are that ugly - and don't get me wrong: they are ugly. For the price you're paying, it's unreasonable ugly. They're on par with hostels, but you're paying 65 pound a night for a single room. Mine had dead cockroaches in the bathroom. The &quot;bed&quot; is actually two couch things nailed together. It slants to one side and slowly dumps you out of bed.As for the location that everyone totes as being so convenient: Earls Court is not a nice part of town by any description. It's close enough to the airport, but to be honest, provided you can carry your bags or pay five quid for a cab, go to the Stratford Hotel Ibis. Yeah it's more expensive: but it's a hotel you can not dread coming back to."
12,545,"Sep 30 2009 	Not a bad word to say against this hotel!	I recently travelled to London with my friend, and we had booked this hotel upon recommendation of her family. When we arrived, the staff were decent, and we were told our room was on the ground floor, which we were happy with. The room was at the end of a maze of corridors, and I was most definitely pleasantly surprised with what awaited us. The room was meant to be a twin room, but it had a double bed, as well as a single. It was clean, quiet and comfortable. We managed to get an excellent deal on the room, so were delighted with the quality. The only small complaint that I would have was that the carpet was worn away in one place, but the next day it had been covered by a mat.Breakfast was included in our offer, and it was grand. Location of the hotel was excellent - Earl's Court is a lovely area. honestly have no complaints at all."
13,545,"Sep 24 2009 	Good location so-so hotel	Located two blocks from the Earl's Court tube station, the Barkston Gardens is a convenient place to stay for travelers in London. The hotel is clean and the staff at reception, especially Lorenza, is very helpful. The room itself is just basic lodging. There was a lot of closet space but few drawers for storage. The room was larger than most European hotel rooms but it could do with refurbishment. All in all, however, it wasn't a bad deal for the price (about $120 American) considering how expensive London is."
14,545,"Sep 22 2009 	Dirty 	Hotel was in a great location because it was a block away from the underground/tube BUT I couldn't take the disgusting room. We both got violently ill (although this could have been from food as well). The room. I don't even know where to begin. Dirt/grime (not stains) on curtains, windows, floors, coffee pot, everywhere in bathroom, baseboards, etc. I even found clipped pieces of wire in the bed. We asked to move rooms but the next one was even worse. I can take creaky floors, old everything (this hotel desperately needs an update), some dust and dirt but this is worse than any military barracks I have stayed in. This wouldn't even qualify as a one star in the US and the Heath Dept would have shut this hotel down.Looks are deceiving. The outside and lobby is gorgeous! We were so happy when we first arrived (until we saw our room). There is no way that the housekeepers vacuum, wash the curtains, dust, etc. I have no idea what they are being paid for except to change the sheets and I am not sure they were changed. If you are homeless, you will enjoy this hotel, especially the location. If you vacuum once a year or wash dishes twice a year, you will still find this place the most gross hotel you have encountered (depending on your room- 5th floor disgusting but so are the stairs throughout).Staff was pretty bad. There was only one nice one--a gentleman that was nice working at night. There was a snooty, skinny blonde (believe English) that wasn't boasting with cheer and an okay front desk clerk. This hotel ruined our perception of London.By the way, free internet but doesn't work on top floors!!!"
15,545,"Sep 20 2009 	2 Star Hotel at absolute best no air-con and no service!	Stayed here for 4 nights in August '09 with my partner.Its a definite no-no to stay during summer as they have central heating in the hotel but no aircon whatsoever. There are also several rooms (like ours) located inbetween floors so you have to drag your suitcases up and down stairs to get to an elevator.Inside the actual room its the tiniest room I've ever seen with the smallest double bed in history, even 2 normal average people lying down on their backs with arms against their sides would be falling off the bed or be on top of each other! TV is 22cm dinosaur and the whole floor creaks and moans and theres no sound proofing at all.The only positive is the location, right next to Earls court tube stop which is a step free tube station so that's handy. Also the old gentleman in charge of the breakfast was excellent and the English cooked breakfast was very good as well.Staff barely spoke English, many were Spanish but in Spain could speak better English.Price isn't that high, but you definitely suffer for the lower price .. and at $65 a night (A$130~A$140) you really expect better."
16,545,"Sep 18 2009 	You'd have to be barking mad to stay at Barkston Gardens	Three star hotels are notoriously Dickensian in London and can't generally be relied upon as they can in Paris and other world capitols. We spent one night in a ground floor room of this &quot;hotel&quot; if it can be called that - it is more akin to an crumbling old rooming house than to a proper hotel. It wasn't very reassuring to find a rat trap under our bed and when we inquired of the gentleman at reception he couldn't garantee that we wouldn't have a rat as a third guest in the room. The hotel's pipes and wires come through un-insulated openings large enough to admit even the largest of vermin because the owners are too cheap to properly renovate this old carcass of a hotel with its rabbit warren like corridors. We were fortunately not visited by rats but, when we had to change rooms the second night due to a previously booked customer, we were shown the only room available - a basement room with a strong odor of mold. We naturally objected and found a proper room for only slightly more and slightly further out in a four star hotel. I don't know how hotels such as the Barkston Gardens gets away with it but no self-respecting guest should ever have to opt for a moldy room, even at $120 per night. It's insulting to be shown such a room and would certainly be unhealthy to have to stay in one. Only London could pass off such a disaster as the Barkston Gardens as a hotel. Any other city in Europe or the US would have it torn down as a health threat. Even four star hotels in London have to be carefully scrutinized by the hapless guest for cleanliness and lack of vermin. If the Barkston Gardens Hotel were a kennel, I would even have reservations about leaving my dog there as it is fit only for mad dogs and Englishmen with no self-respect."
17,545,"Sep 17 2009	avoid at all costs	Absolutley horrible. Run down, mildew and mold everywhere in bathroom. Staff simply didn't care. Free continental breakfast, barely adequate, but featured a most officious breakfast captain, who controlled the dining room. The hostel down the street is likely a better value and probably in bertter condition"
18,545,"Sep 11 2009 	Excellent	We stayed at this hotel from 6th to 13th August in a double ensuite room (room number 422 on the 2nd floor). The room was quite spacious (if compared to what you usually get in London for 65) and the bathroom was big as well.At the time of booking we decided to have continental breakfast only, but you may also have your breakfast being served in your room if you pay a 2.5 extra. The staff was EXTREMELY polite and helpful. On Sunday morning breakfast is available from 8am, but we had to leave the hotel very early to participate in a day tour outside London. A member of the staff asked us what time we wanted to have breakfast and the day of the tour he proposed us to prepare our breakfast at 7am just to do us a favour. Excellent service and very helpful staff.In addition to this, the hotel's location is excellent: Earl's Court tube station is just a stone's throw (less than 200 metres); there you can decide whether to take a Districy/Circle or Piccadilly train to reach the city centre. In this area there are lots of restaurants and pubs which are open until late.That was the 4th time that I had stayed in a hotel in London and Barkston Gardens Hotel was the best one.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.Abbiamo soggiornato al Barkston Gardens Hotel dal 6 al 13 di Agosto 2009 in una doppia con servizi in camera (stanza 422, al secondo piano con ascensore). La stanza era abbastanza larga, soprattutto se si considerano gli standard londinesi.Il nostro  stato un ottimo affare perch, prenotando con largo anticipo, abbiamo concordato la tariffa di 65 a notte per camera con la colazione continentale compresa nel prezzo. Lo staff  stato decisamente gentile e a nostra completa disposizione. Visto che la domenica mattina la colazione viene servita a partire dalle 8 ma noi dovevamo partire per un tour molto presto, credevamo che quel giorno avremmo perso la nostra colazione. Un membro dello staff ci ha domandato a che ora avessimo bisogno di partire e ci ha proposto di scendere in sala colazioni allora desiderata anche se il servizio non era ancora ufficialmente disponibile. E stato molto gentile da parte sua, noi non avevamo insistito ma lui ha voluto farci questo piacere. Assolutamente apprezzabile.Per quanto riguarda la posizione dellhotel, bisogna ammettere che  ottima: la stazione della metro di Earls Court  davvero a due passi, direi a meno di 200metri. La zona  tranquilla, piuttosto turistica e infatti ci sono molti pub, ristoranti, super e mini-market aperti anche fino a tardi.Questa  stata la nostra quarta volta a Londra in hotel di questa categoria e devo ammettere che il Barkston Gardens  stata una piacevole scoperta, il migliore rispetto a tutti quelli visitati fino al momento. Per concludere: ottima posizione, ottimo servizio, grande disponibilit, stanze sufficientemente spaziose, colazione o servizio in camera fino alle 11 di sera(con il supplemento di 2.50 a camera), buona la colazione, eccellente rapporto qualit/prezzo.Vi torneremo sicuramente.Consiglio questo hotel senza esitazioni!"
19,545,"Aug 18 2009 	TERRIBLE customer service rude staff	We had booked a four night stay at this hotel via HRS, but decided over a week in advance that we wanted to go to the countryside on the third night (wishing to retain nights 1, 2 and 4).HRS does not allow you to amemd your booking to drop a middle night, so we called the hotel directly from abroad (at some expense!!!!)The receptionist advised us that we would have to re-book the fourth night at 20 pounds higher per night than the rate we had locked in via HRS!!! She spoke heavily accented english which we could barely understand, and was incredibly rude (at one point calling us stupid). And an email to the manager still has no response 48 hours later.... BEWARE!!!!"
20,545,Jul 29 2009 	Great location on a budget	My husband and I stayed at Barkston Gardens the end of April. Fairly large room with double bed and large bathroom. Very nice for cheap price - bigger than expected. Included breakfast which was perfect to start the day. Staff were helpful and polite. The location is the best if you can't afford to stay in central London. Right on the Piccadily Line at Earl's Court tube station - you are the last stop in Zone 1. It is a great neighbourhood to retreat to after an evening seeing the sights. Also excellent for taking the Tube to Heathrow airport - 5 minutes from Tube station.
21,545,"Jul 25 2009 	Still A Good Hotel But!!!	Once again we stayed at this hotel, for ease of travel it could not be better, value for money was excellent, a large double room for 60 pn, (booked through expedia) in the heart of London has got to be a good deal.we like to stay on the top floor (6th) as the floorboards are still squeaking and no one above to annoy you.Still a problem with hot water but enough to get a good wash, though the shower on occassions was slower.Wrote to the hotel last year about new windows as still using the old wooden sash type but noticed that they were still the same.apart from this it ios a little gem and well worth it, after all you only need a bed at night and could not find them more comfortable."
22,545,"Jul 20 2009 	Great location good value	Basic budget hotel. Fab location, just a few yards from Earls Court Tube station. Creaky floors, little insulation (we ended up with room 308 - a bit more secluded than most others). They were doing a bit of work on the electrical wires when we arrived and our room had two electricians in it upon arrival, but seconds later we where on out way to another (and a bit larger) room.A bit tired but clean and nice. Perfect when travelling to/from London via Heathrow. And at 60 a night it was well worth it.Hotel also has a luggage room for late depratures (like ours).Didn't try the breakfast as we opted to eat at a nearby pub, The Courtfield - cooked English breakfast from $4.99."
23,545,"Jul 1 2009 	average stay	I stayed in London at this hotel from June the 2nd to June 5th on my way to Athens...Hotel is close to Earls Court station so easy to access from Heathrow..had asked a single room but had a double room though did not like the beds at all found them uncomfortable...very hot when in London and the room was unbearable due to hot weather..i did not see any fan in the room, guess should have asked for it...rooms were spacey by London values but basic and tired . Lobby is good and welcoming, breakfast continental and was included but nothing special about it, though for me it was enough.I did not find it very clean and that made me kind of uneasy.Staff except one dark brown hair one who was nice the rest were totally average in being helpful and in their customer service. I guess for the price i paid it was good but overall i do not like the Earls court area and prefer Knights Bridge so far, was on a budget this time , have decided to try a new area each time in London...will stay there only if it is a short stay and not during the summer and if i do not find a better one."
24,545,"Jun 26 2009 	No value for money	The rooms were hot, no air conditioning or fans, no bar fridge. Furniture was old and falling apart. Had kettle but no lead. Bed cover and carpets were dirty. Had to keep asking where bar staff were when you wanted a drink. Only served breakfast - no other meals as dining room semi closed."
25,545,"Jun 21 2009 	we found a cockroach in our bed. do not stay in the basement.	this hotel was good value for london and in a great location. initially, we stayed in a sixth floor room which was fine, but on the second to last night we were moved to a basement room (long story) and in the morning found a COCKROACH in our bed. IN THE BED!! i can only imagine it crawled under the covers with us some time during the night!! we freaked, were moved to the sixth floor, and no more cockroaches. but DO NOT stay in the basement. COCKROACHES!"
26,545,"Jun 20 2009 	excellent value close to tube station really clean	close to tube station,was really easy to find. first impressions from outside was ok but lobby was nice and spacious. We found all the staff really nice and helpful. Our room was small but it was just enough space as we were gone most of the day anyway. Initally the room was warm when we arrived but the fan cooled the room down in no time at all. Our room was really clean and we had maid service and towel change every day. Only thing we weren't really keen on was the continental breckfast appart from that everything was great When we checked out there was a luggage room provided so we could collect it later. It was in a quiet area so it was easy to sleep. appart from the odd noisy guest in the hotel itself."
27,545,"Jun 12 2009 	Tired and Tatty Room	The location for our visit was good. Easy walking distance from tube - though not a great help as there was a tube strike on our second and third day. Reception staff very pleasant and helpful allowed us to check in before time. Our room on the top floor, though large was very gloomy and had no ventilation. There was a small portable fan and the window was broken. The reception area and breakfast area were bright and cheerful. Breakfast was adequate."
28,545,"May 28 2009 	Close to train station and great breakfast	This hotel is a short walk from Earls Court train station. We used the underground from this station to travel around London. There are a number of small shops on the way to the station where you can buy snacks and also places to eat. There is a park across the road as others have mentioned but access if by key and limited to the local residents.The hotel is old and worn with thin walls and small rooms, but you would have to pay a lot more probably to get something better. The breakfast was very nice with plenty to eat. Despite being around the corner from a pub it was very quiet."
29,545,"May 26 2009 	It was ok nothing spectacular.	Fodor's recommended this budget hotel and from the photos on TA, I thought it would be great for the $150 I was paying considering everything else I could find in a nice area of London was $200 or more for 3 adults (myself and my 19 and 21 year old). The Barkston is an old quirky hotel...it was like walking through a maze getting to our room because of all the closed fired doors and listening to the floor creak, but yet it brought you back in time so I didn't really mind that. But there is no air conditioning so I wouldn't stay here in the summer. We had a bottom floor room facing the street so leaving the window open (and only one window opens about 5 inches) made me a little nervous but it was way too hot otherwise and we were there May 15 when the night temperature was in the 60's. A small fan provided helped, but I know it would probably be miserable if it was any hotter outside. And I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a room in the building over the court as pictured. The Barkston is actually on two sides of the street. The one side where you check in, is a pretty white building and then across the street is the huge red brick courtyard building that's in the photos.Convenience to the tube is excellent. As soon as you exit Earl's Court tube, turn right. Barkston Gardens is either the first or second street you see. There are no street signs, you must look on the corners of the buildings for the street names....and not all corners have them (unfortunately for the lost) but Barkston Gardens is named.The family room we had was a good size room with high ceilings. The single and double bed were comfortable enough but they had set up a pull out couch bed that my daughter slept in. She said it was ok but when I sat on it, I felt it was awful....sinking in the center and lumpy mattress. The staff overall were excellent. Very friendly and helpful. Only one lady should be fired. She was a 30ish blond women with glasses at the front desk upon our check in. She was cool towards us which I don't care, but I watched as she was downright rude to her co-worker and while the co-worker was trying to assist an Asian women who was struggling with english, she told the co-worker to just charge the woman, knowing the foreign lady could not understand that she was going to be charged. When the foreign lady was trying to question or understand, the blond woman shoved our key to us (basically we were dismissed), raised her voice and started berating the Asian woman. Later on when we were leaving, I mentioned to her that the toilet in our room didn't flush. She made a face and said she would send someone to fix it. When we got back 8 hours later, it was clear no one ever came or was in our room. The next morning, a gentleman was behind the desk and I again mentioned the toilet. Because they are old, you have to pump the water in to flush it. He explained to me how to do it and the problem was solved.The continental breakfast was ok....cereal, croissants, toast, ham and cheeses. Continental was included in our price but I wouldn't have paid for it otherwise.We were only in London for 2 days so the Barkston was satisfactory. If we had to stay longer, I'm not sure this would be my choice and I've never been to London before so maybe this is typical."
30,545,"May 3 2009 	Pleasantly surprised.	I spent a Saturday night here and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I wasn't expecting much due to the price &amp; location (which were both very good), but this hotel has everything you need. Yes, decor was generally a bit tired, but if you want sparkling new &amp; modern you will have to pay more. Service was good, I actually booked a single room, but they gave me a double - I guess because it was available, which was good of them as it wasn't necessary. Sheets were clean, bathroom was clean and location was lovely - overlooking a small park and off the main road so was really quiet for central London - and on a Saturday night, so I was expecting the worst. Literally 1 min walk to earls court tube. One not so good thing - even though it was only 20C outside the room was very warm, even with the windows open. However, a free standing fan is provided - another unexpected touch, so this quickly reduced the room temperture, and it ran quietly, so I left it on overnight. However, I don't think this would be a comfortable place to stay in he height of summer. Overall though I would defintely use it again if I needed to stay in a central location in London that was good value for money. Oh yes, and checkout is 12noon - so no rush to leave, which is a bonus if the night before was spent in Soho!"
31,545,"May 2 2009 	value for money!	What a find! Clean, handsome, well-run hotel in London for about 80 GBP ($120) a night. The rooms are spacious (for London) and bright. Bathroom was big and newly refurbished, and the shower was great. Our room, #206, led to an almost-private courtyard. The hotel is about a 3-minute walk from Earl's Court tube, which gives easy access to everywhere (including Heathrow), and is across the street from a park. Breakfast is available, and there is a small bar in the hotel. Wireless Internet was reliable, even in our room. Staff were accessible and friendly. This was just great."
32,545,"Apr 14 2009 	Great location... sour finish	You can't ask for better in regards to location. We spent four nights at the end of March. You also get a decent sized room and bathroom for the price you pay. Unfortunately, the shower was awful and almost unusable, we ended up having to be creative to not burn or freeze. The cooked breakfast was really greasy (deep fried everything) and definitely not recommended. We changed our mind on the last day and ordered only the continental breakfast (which we were told was fine), however, they charged us for two cooked breakfast anyways. When we mentioned it, the man who said he was the day manager was very rude and refused to change our bill before he charged our credit card. When I emailed the main manager, she replied that we would have had to cancel our room booking while at the hotel and then rebook in order not to be charged the extra amount!"
33,545,"Apr 1 2009 	Nice hotel - Great location. Would definitely stay again.	Stayed there for 3 nights in Feb-March 08'. Was recommended to stay there by a friend and wasn't disappointed. Nothing can beat the location, a couple of minutes away from the tube station, from which I did most of my trips around the city. There is also a Tesco store, a pharmacy and a Burger King just across the road. Had a view of a lovely garden just outside the window.Room was fairly small but cosy and heated, clean and neat. The shower stream was lacking a bit of life, though it was told on an info sheet inside the lift that it was due to maintenance in the water system, although they did say it would affect the water stream between 5-7 am, and in my room at least, it lasted all day.All in all, was worth the price and what you would expect from a 3 star hotel. Would definitely be coming back."
34,545,"Mar 25 2009 	Amazing Location Soured by Old Dingy Feel	We stayed at the Barkston Garden Hotel for three days on our recent trip to London. The location cannot be beat - about a 2 minute walk from the underground station. It's in a great little neighborhood with a grocery store, pharmacy, and a lot of restaurants around for entertainment. The hotel has a cute walk-up, and is well-lit with friendly front desk staff. There is free wi-fi available throughout the hotel if you have a laptop, which was a huge bonus for us.It has been said before, but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. The first thing I noticed was that when we walked into our room (which was at the end of a long hall with zero lights), the floor creaked. EVERYWHERE. There wasn't one spot in the small room that didn't make noise when you walked around, which I'm sure irritated the people below us. The bathroom was quite large, but the showerhead was a miser with water. We froze every time we showered because the water wouldn't come out fast enough, so by the last day, I had resorted to washing my hair under the running tap.We considered the room fine, because we weren't expecting much, but even so, I wouldn't stay here again. I will definitely pay more and upgrade my experience."
35,545,"Mar 23 2009 	Great location	Me and and two friends stayed here friday to sunday - this hotel is great location for underground and lots of places to eat and drink in earls court. The room was clean, the beds were good although I had the sofa bed - not comfy at all but I slept so was okay. Bathroom was large - we had hot water which was good but the shower sprayed water all over the floor - but we didn't care coz we had hot water was the main thing and it was fast hot water. The manager was very friendly when we came for continental breakfast. Staff are friendly. I would recommend this hotel."
36,545,"Mar 22 2009 	Got what you paid for...	Me and my Fiance stayed in the Barkston for 2 nights in March. We paid 50 per night for the room. Our room was number 304. On arrival, my fiance noticed when you opened the `patio` door/window, when you shut it, it wouldn't lock, and was easy to pull or push open. Not great considering there was no safe in the room, and on check in we were not offered a safe. It was very annoying when we checked out, I commented on the room and about the spring sticking out of the mattress and everything else, and all the man did was scribbled it down on a peice of paper and just said `ok` when I finished.NO SORRY about that, and thankyou for letting us know.Anyway, we left the hotel and went out. When we came back I got into bed, and felt a sharp pain in my leg, when I looked, I saw a spring that was stuck out of the mattress on the left side of the bed. It was stuck out about two inches, and had caught my leg. Because of the time I just pushed the spring back into the mattress and covered it over with the sheet. When we woke in the morning, we ran the tap for a bath, and had NO hot water. We had reasonably hot water on an evening, but NONE in a morning. Another couple of picky things were the walls are like paper-like some of the reviews said you can hear everything that goes on above you, and the decor is very dated, but this didnt bother us. The pipes to the radiator were exposed-the radiator didnt work, and had two portable radiators in the room, along with a fan, kettle, very old hair dryer, drop down ironing board and old iron (didnt use any of these)The shower head was an old metal one...the tiles around the bathroom could of done with a good clean, and when I had my first bath, I had to wash the bath out as there were `body hair` in the bath.The good points to this hotel though, were that you got a television in your room with about 10 channels on it, you got a sofa bed as well as a bed and plenty of pillows and bedding, you had a desk with a full length mirror, a wardrobe, kettle and tea/coffee and sugar with two packs of biscuits, room service every morning and clean towels, free internet in the bar downstairs, and the lager looked lively!!The breakfast in a morning was ok, not a big fan, it was a continental breakfast, croissants were hard, toast was cold.People that worked there weren't english-but this is very comman in London. Would not stay here again, have learnt that it pays to pay more when it comes to your accommodation. Area was good and central, a bit rough but....you can't have everything!!"
37,545,"Mar 9 2009 	Good For the Cost	The selection of this hotel for our stay in London was based on cost and location (its within a 2 minute walk of Earls Court Underground) and the cost averaged 55 per night.The staff were friendly and helpful during our stay. The room was available to us despite arriving a little early and the check in/out was fast.The room itself was larger that others we've stayed in, in the area. The decor is showing signs of wear and is probably due a revamp. The window is our room didn't lock although it opened onto a flat roof. There were some extras (a floor standing fax, trouser press etc) that lead to the room seeming cluttered. The bathroom was large athough the shower head kept sliding down the height adustment bracket.Free wifi in the hotel bar was a plus with free newspapers available with breakfast. We had a continental breakfast included in the room rate and we found it good enough to set us up for the day (cereal, OJ, tex, coffee, toast, rolls, yogurts, ham, chess and fruit)I would stay here again"
38,545,"Feb 25 2009 	Decent hotel with some pros and cons	We stayed in the Barkston Gardens hotel for three nights in late february for 60 euros a night, which is a good deal for a hotel in central London. The hotel had pros and cons:Pros:* Location; just 200 metres from Earl's Court tube, which is on the Picadilly and District Line.* free continental breakfast with fresh croissants and rolls* Comfortable bed (but it was small)* Decent bathroom with a lot of space, hot water and good water pressure.* Computer with free use of internet in the lobby and free wifi (when it's working... see cons)Cons:* The room was very hot. We had to sleep without any blankets. I think it was at least 25C in the room, may have been more.* The creaky floors. We could hear the people above us walking around the room and were annoyed by our own creaky floor* The showerhead could use some cleaning!* Very slow elevator, we used the stairs instead.* The wi fi internet wasn't available on the first two days we were thereAll in all we had a nice stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone who is travelling on a budget! Just don't expect luxury and dress lightly!"
39,545,"Feb 18 2009 	Location is great...Hotel is not.	I live in Chicago and am no stranger to tired buildings but this one needs to be retired. The place looked old and worn out but I thought it was at least clean...until the cockroach crawled across the floor. I am sure everybody will not have this same experience but after checking in and dropping off our luggage we left to go check out the neighborhood. When we returned back to the hotel we found that our key did not work nor did the other 3 keys that were made for us at the front desk. It ended up that the hotel maintenance was not able to get our door open until the next morning at about 11am and our luggage was still in the room. We were put up at their sister hotel and given free cab fare to and from there. Seeing as we did not have any of our luggage and were locked out of our room for roughly 14 hours it was a major inconvenience and I really do not think the situation was handled very well.It has been a while but I think they did not even comp that night and were given the excuse that they couldn't because we booked through Expedia. If you stay here keep an open mind and make sure you bring a sense of humor. (you will need it) Also, don't take any room on the 1st floor...it is the basement...and from my experience that is where the cockroaches live. Last but not least, know that you get what you pay for. Good luck and enjoy your vacation!"
40,545,"Feb 15 2009 	Cheap 	Booked this hotel through Alpharooms we had a 3 night stay for 160 for the both of us. Hotel is very near Earls Court tube station and shops and pubs but we did not hear any noise at night time. The room we had was done is stairs and was quite gloomy, the heating was not working but they had gave us a small heater which took the chill out of the room and we only had hot water one day, other two days the water was tepid think you have to watch what time you have your shower get up early but it had good pressure to it. The hotel is clean but a bit dated we had clean towels every day and the breakfast was ok.We were hardly every in our room so we were not bothered about the down sides. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a cheap break in London. Gave above average for the price."
41,545,"Feb 1 2009 	Good Budget Hotel for London	Location is definitely a great selling point for this hotel - just off Earls Court Road, which is full of places to eat and a very quick walk to the tube. Nevertheless, our room was very quiet, overlooking the residences that back onto the rear of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, allowing us to check-in two hours early without charge. I'll be honest - when I visit London I don't spend too much time in the hotel and this is fine for crashing out at the end of the day. Beds were comfortable and the room itself was of a good size and clean. The bathroom would have benefited from a little refurbishment work but was perfectly acceptable. I cannot comment on breakfast as I always ate outside the hotel. Note: no evening meals are now being served. Only downside to our stay was the lift. It proved increasingly difficult to call and by the last day had given up completely. We left the engineers to it and walked down the stairs. Could happen anywhere but it did seem that this event wasn't too unusual. May not be great for those with limited mobility. Don't expect 5* comfort here but for a brief visit to London on a budget, it's fine. I would recommend the hotel for budget conscious travellers who do not spend too much time at the hotel. If you're looking for luxury, it may not be the place for you. For the value, it gets four stars."
42,545,"Dec 19 2008 	Enjoyed staying there	I spent three nights in the Barkston Gardens Hotel in mid-December. The hotel web page itself seems to be the cheapest way to book a room. I am used to travelling on a budget, and I also stayed at other Earl's Court hotels before. All in all, this hotel turned out to be my best choice in the area so far. I really enjoyed my stay at Barkston Gardens very much. First of all, as many others have already noted, the location is excellent - very (!) close to Earl's Court Tube station but nevertheless in a quiet street. Besides the many small surrounding shops and pubs, there is also a huge Sainsbury's at just a few minutes distance at Cromwell Road.Though others have criticized that the hotel might benefit from refurbishment, I found my room as well as the public area very clean, charming and cozy. The high ceilings, the big windows and the light and warm colours clearly contributed to this impression. The bed was really huge and comfortable, and the whole room was large for a London hotel. Though the heating was a bit difficult to regulate, room temperature was pleasant. There were, however, a few points that might be problematic for travellers who are used to higher standards, though they didn't bother me that much. As was also already mentioned before, water pressure could have been better, though the temperature was warm enough. Moreover, for some reason, the fire alarm turned on a few times in the middle of my first night. Finally, as this is an old building, floors tend to be rather noisy, so it might be a good idea to use earplugs in the night.Hotel reception staff was ok, though they could have been a little bit more concerned. Breakfast was a rather hectic experience - though I'm convinced that the staff wanted to make everything perfect, they could have been a bit more relaxed. The continental breakfast was included in the price and was really good. In sum, I really liked the place, as it is such a nice house with comfortable rooms in a great location. I will definitely try to stay there again at my next visit to London."
43,545,"Dec 2 2008 	Competitive price for a comfortable hotel	Pros:- 50 mt from Earl's Court station;- quiet zone, with fast food and restaurants in the immediate nearby;- comfortable bed with two pillows (and I am 1.90mt high);- very good price: I paid 50 pounds/day.- clean bathroom and room;- free wifi;Neutral:- breakfast;- very hot, I cannot stay fully dressed in my room;Cons:- noisy floor, especially from the above floor;"
44,545,"Nov 28 2008 	lived up to the reviews	As a traveller on a budget I rely heavily on Trip Advisor reviews when it comes to booking accomodation. Once again I have found a hotel which (perhaps because of realistic expectations) has not dissapointed.Yes it is a little tired (especially in the corridors) and a lick of paint would do no harm. Yes the floors creaked and as an added extra during my one week stay the fire alarm went off for no apparent reason a number of times ... including memorably once at 1am !!BUT ...... The room I was allocated was clean, the bedding (and importantly the bed itself) was in good order. The bathroom was well maintained and while I did have a shower over the bath i also had a bath large enough to have a proper bath in .. and I had no problems with lack of hot water.The staff were very helpful .... starting with reception who, even though I arrived at 10am were happy for me to check in and go straight to my room. Gus and his team made sure that the breakfast rush was well managed and the cooked breakfast was fine.The hotel is well located and when I compared its prices with others that I investigated gives value for money."
45,545,"Nov 27 2008 	To some extent then - the luck of the draw	In London with my work - stayed at this hotel, Monday with a check out Friday morning, on two consecutive weeks. Overall impressions: Staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel is tired but the bedding and towels in the rooms are clean and in good order. On both my visits I was located at the front of the building overlooking what must be, The Barkston Gardens. The hotel is just around the corner from the Earls Court tube, (Earls Court Road end). I like to sleep with the window open, and the noise from the Earls Court Road was always present and can be really loud at times. Breakfast was provided, staff friendly - but the fare was so totally bland I only tried it the once. First week: small single room  cosy, on the fourth floor. Cubicle shower, quite adequate, but hot water is something that appears to be provided only at certain times during any 24-hour period . The central heating works fine and can be turned up and down to suit; so if you like it cooler when you go to bed, as I do, then youre catered for. Nice touch: tea coffee making facility provided and the staff did keep this topped up. Second week: larger room on the sixth floor. Shower over bath  and I can only guess that due to insufficient water pressure at this altitude was the reason I had to run around under the shower in order to get wet  didnt really matter though as hot water barely managed to get up there. When in the room I noted that from the state of my bare black feet, that the carpet was due a clean - could have really used that hot water.To some extent then, clearly a case of the luck of the draw in The Barkston. Although I have returned to London for subsequent weeks Ive relocated to another hotel for a similar price and overall Im happier there."
46,545,"Nov 6 2008 	Cheap but a bit of a dump	This hotel is in a pretty good location, on a side street off Earls' Court Road, overlooking a garden area. It is very convenient for the Earls' Court tube station. The traffic and people on the main road are audible but with the windows shut just about bearable (ear plugs might be a good move though). The noise does continue fairly late though.The hotel is pretty grubby-looking (paintwork etc desperately needs attention) which makes you feel that it is not very clean, although in reality the sheets and bathroom seemed fine. It's ok if you're on a budget and willing to tolerate it, but not ideal.My main gripe was the temperature of the room. I visited in November and for some reason the room was absolutely boiling hot. I arrived about 10pm and opened the windows immediately, in the hope that it would cool down before I wanted to go to sleep. The radiator had evidently been on but was off by that time and there seemed to be no other way to control the temperature. Unfortunately it remained extremely hot all through the night, forcing me to leave the windows and curtains wide open to try and get as much air as possible, and even then I only got a few hours' sleep. I do not think this is normal for November, especially considering that I generally get cold easily!I will definitely not be returning."
47,545,Nov 2 2008 	positionposition	this hotel is a typically old London hotel with acceptable service and good breakfast - though it can get a little crowded.However the position is great - a side street off Earl's Court Road facing leafy private gardens.The tube is a five minute walk and offers a quick direct ride from Heathrow being on the Piccadilly line which then offers you an ideal base to all the attractions of London.Get an Oyster card before you leave for use on the tube from Heathrow and then yse it for the rest of your stay.It's so easy and much cheaper than single tickets.Avoid eating at the pubs in Earl's Court - check out the little restaurants down some of the side streets .
48,545,Nov 2 2008	perfect location	all reviews i read before booking this hotel were right. the hotel is a perfect location with subway only about 2 mins away. only complaint and it very small was that lift so slow. would highly recommend it to anyone going to london just for holiday. willie waterford ireland.
49,545,"Oct 22 2008 	Convenient location-close to tube	I picked this hotel as I needed to stay in the Earls Court area and wanted to be near the tube so I wouldn't have to drag my suitcase very far. This hotel is ideally situated.Check in was efficient and friendy. I was on the 4th floor - there is a lift. My room was at the back and was very quiet. The room was clean, tidy and cosy. A hospitality tray was provided with a kettle, tea, coffee and 2 packs of biscuits. There was a trouser press, chest of drawers and a small wardrobe with approx 6 hangers.There was a TV - old but works fine for the main 5 channels.The bathroom was fine - shower over the bath. Plenty of towels and a little basket containing soap, shower cap, sewing kit and shoe shine pad. There was a large container of shower gel mounted on the wall above the bath,.Continental breakfast was included in my room rate. The breakfast room was very busy - it was a Sunday morning - but I got a table without trouble. The choice of breakfast items was fine. Different cereals, tinned fruit including prunes, slices of ham and cheese, croissants and fresh rolls ( which were lovely) toast, yoghurt, tea and coffee. The staff were very efficient in clearing tables etc.If required there are plenty of places to eat in Earls Court Road which is a minutes walk from the hotel - restaurants, takeaways, coffee shops, pubs, grocery shops etc. I needed to leave my luggage at the hotel after check out time and this was no problem as they have a secure luggage room.All in all I had a good stay at this reasonably priced hotel and I would certainly stay there again when I am next in London."
50,545,"Oct 19 2008 	This wonderful hotel seems to generate very mixed reviews.	It was only with great trepidation that I took a chance that the guests who had loved this hotel were more precise than those who hated it. I was travelling with a good friend who expects good accommodations and who is probably used to spending more than what I am willing to spend.I booked this room as part of a package through Air Canada vacations. They had the best deal for a direct flight from Ottawa and had the flexibility to book for the exact number of days we needed to be in London.Our check-in and check out were efficient, they had a safety deposit box for our valuables. They also had plug adaptors at the front desk for a small deposit so I could plug my laptop and camera into the 240 volt mains power. (check to ensure that you have a switch able 110 - 240 volt power supply) My bedside lamp died one morning and when the problem was reported to the front desk they came right up with a box of assorted lamps, one which corrected the problem.Our room on level 4 faced the back courtyard - not a very pretty view but very quiet. We had a large bedroom with a comfortable king-sized bed with sufficient room to move about in and plenty of storage space. The room and bathroom were approximately twice the size of similar priced accommodations I have had in Paris.There have been comments about the television reception - about the 5 available channels and the old TVs - but we could get the BBC for the news and who needs anything else. The room also has wireless internet (slow), an iron and ironing board and a hair dryer. The bathroom was enormous with a large tub and shower with an unlimited supply of hot water though the shower was tricky and it took a little time to determine how it worked.Our room was super clean with very cosy towels and sheets We had pre-paid for the continental buffet breakfast as part of our package deal. There seems to be a lot of complaints about the breakfasts but I dont know what the complainers are talking about. Every morning our breakfast included an assortment of juices; coffee (the English have difficulty making palatable coffee) and tea; prunes, grapefruit and orange slices or peaches; sliced ham and cheese; toast and jams. The full English breakfast is an additional 4.50 pounds. Granted this isnt what I normally eat for breakfast but the variety and quantity of the food offered was very reasonable considering the cost. On a few occasions we had to wait for about 5 minutes for a seat in the welcoming and bright breakfast room. The service was efficient and friendly. The hotel is located about a three minute walk from Earls Court - There is terrific local connections to the tube and buses run frequently a few steps away. We found a number of local restaurants, Chinese, Indian and French which were both inexpensive and excellent just around the corner on Earls Court Road, Earls Court Gardens, Hogarth Place and Kenway Road. In closing I found the staff helpful and their English skills were adequate to their tasks."
51,545,"Oct 19 2008 	Dump	Cracky floors, very diry carpets, walls in need of paint, dirty bed sheets, water pressure problems at the bathroom. Overall, if you can book this hotel for around 40GBP its a fair deal. The facility is very below average. Not worth trying to save the extra bucks. My travel partner's room was worse and he encountered rouches!!!"
52,545,"Oct 13 2008 	what a gem	This was my second stay at the Barkston Gardens, having stayed in May 08 also. The reason i returned was because it was such a great stay the first time round i thought it must be a fluke.It wasnt, the hotel is a little worn and could do with a little decor TLC however it is clean, the staff are friendly, the rooms are a good size and it is so advantageously situated for travel with both underground, road links and within walking distance (25mins) from some of the museums through some of londons most affulent and beguiling architecture. Also you can simply fall out of the hotel and you are eating out in any number of restaurants you simply couldnt ask for more.Another 10/10 from me and a definate promise to return.A well priced gem in the heart of London."
53,545,"Sep 26 2008 	Nice LocationMismanaged Hotel	This is actually a very nice location if you want to stay in central london but i have not seen a hotel that has such an advantage but has been so poorly managed.Rooms were dirty,old paint on all the walls,bathroom dirty....am planning to visit london again...i will give you the latest update about this hotel.Frank[---]"
54,545,"Aug 29 2008 	Itchy few days!	I booked this hotel as a 40th Birthday surprise and emailed the hotel advising it was a 40th but got no reply....perhaps I was hoping for to much! Arrived, checked in and all ok, had asked for joining rooms as we have 2 young children and got rooms on different floors which makes sharing the shampoo and toothpaste a cardiac workout! Rooms are basic, only 5 channels on TV but you are in London so TV is not a priority. After 1st night I noticed bite marks from insects on my arms, checked the beds and found....what we think were bed bugs, now I am home and checked on the net I am convinced! In fact I am still itching now!Rooms get very warm, our windows looked onto the back, into private homes so make sure your curtains are closed. The floors creak but it is old.Breakfast is very very simple. Its not even what I would class a continental breakfast which is what it was advised as. You get a pot of Tea, Coffee or Chocolate. 3 Rounds of toast (4 people), the &quot;buffet&quot; is a plate of cheese slices, ham slices, buns, yoghurts, fruit (tinned) and cereal...(how old??). The staff are all foreign, If you need help getting to places ask at the tube, they are very helpful. Bar is for the dead or elderly only, the lady serving spent the hour glaring at us as we only got 1 round!So I think thats it, we will not be staying there again...its cheap (ish) not cheerful and very basic....and with bed bugs!"
55,545,"Aug 23 2008 	Cockroach towers	Well, great location, just a shame about the cockroaches! Two of us stayed here for 3 nights (each booked singles) and by the end of our stay we had slept in 5 rooms. Our first single rooms were rather grimy and at about midnight the cockroaches came out! We were given insect spray and then moved; my new room (admittedly it was the only room available and was not meant to be used due to a maintenance problem) had a sink and bath that did not drain. My colleagues room was OK, but for some reason she was moved again, this time to a room without a working shower!. Our biggest gripe apart from the additional guests in our initial rooms was the general cleanliness; during our entire stay it did not appear that the stairwells and corridors were vacuumed, with food crumbs trampled into the carpet...no wonder the cockroaches enjoyed their stay!"
56,545,"Aug 20 2008 	Good location average hotel	This hotel is strictly average. The size of the room you're in is hit or miss, so be a little fussy while checking in. The rooms have all the basic amenities and are reasonable clean and comfortable.Breakfast is usually included and is adequate, but nothing fancy. Don't bother with room service or the hotel restaurant, there's plenty of options for food and drink nearby that are far better. Staff are rather stoic and don't speak English very well.The advantage of picking this hotel is its location--it's a stone's throw from Earl's Court station on the Picadilly Line, so getting to the hotel from Heathrow Airport is quite easy. And once you're there, the proximity to the Tube station makes it quite easy to get to other parts of London you want to go."
57,545,"Aug 6 2008 	Complete Satisfaction	Excellent Hotel, main is Room and Bed Size Confort and cleanness is Important, Everythig is all right, stay there and Happy and Enjoyble Trip! NICE!!"
58,545,"Jul 20 2008	Worst Hotel we have ever stayed at please look elsewhere!!!!	First of all the hotel receptionist didn't have a clue and she didn't care one single bit....My husband and I and our two young daughters had to get two rooms and we asked for rooms next to each other or even on the same floor...one room was on level 5 and the other one was level 2 near the basement...you had to pass 4 fire exits with all your luggage....we tried telling them we had to have two rooms close together as we had organised it months ago but they didn't care!!!It only gets worse, the room on the 5th floor, i was sure that the room was going to collapse as the floor creaked every time you moved...you could not sleep at all as who the hell knows what the people above us were doing all night, it was so noisy from the creaking that we had a terrible sleepless night...The room we had down on level 2 was freezing...the carpet smelled like it hadn't been cleaned for 5 years...The bed was hard as a rock, we would have been better off sleeping on the road and im not joking!!The breakfast maitre'd, did not give you a chance to sit down before he shouted at you whether you wanted tea or coffee!! Not much selection at breakfast at all and the staff at breakfast were so ARROGANT!! I have never seen anything like this before in my life. Not one of them had a smile on their face!! It really put a damper on our trip and we will be definitely telling everyone we know not to stay there!!!The only one good thing about that hotel was the location but at the time we stayed there there was a burst water main around the area so there were a few buses operating which made it hard...I hope this helps you and if you really want to have a good stay in London please don't stay at this hotel!!"
59,545,"Jul 12 2008 	Loved the King Tut exhibition	Stayed here for one night. Hotel was clean, but the room we stayed in was a bit on the small side and the carpet a bit shabby.It was continental breakfast but not much choice. Overall though it was not far from the underground and would consider it to be a reasonable hotel for the price paid."
60,545,"Jul 5 2008 	Convenient Quiet Location	Our family of 3 stayed at the Barkston Gardens Hotel for 5 nights. Having previously traveled in Europe, we're aware that the standards in European budget hotels are not the same as are expected routinely by US hotel guests. The last time we stayed in London, the room was only slightly larger than our single double bed.Our family room was spacious and comfortable, allowing us to move around without tripping over each other or our suitcases. Yes the carpet is worn, and (as expected) the floor was very squeaky, but the street outside was quiet at night, and we loved having a view of the gardens across the street.The continental breakfast had enough variety that you didn't have to eat exactly the same thing every day, but it gave you a good start for your day and the breakfast room was sunny and pleasant. We loved the convenience of being so close to the tube stop, and thought that the prices on the nearby restaurants were more reasonable than those in Central London. We ate at Dino's and the Little French Restaurant.We would stay here the next time we visit London"
61,545,"Jun 2 2008 	Value for money !!	We booked this hotel as we were staying in London on a budget and were looking for a hotel near central London. We had booked the full English for breakfast and found this to be good value and there was plenty to eat, along with the continental on offer was enough to set you up for the day. The staff were poliet and friendly enough. We booked a double room and were pleasantly surprised to find 3 double beds in our room along with a massive bathroom, all clean. The hotel is clean but if anything could do with a spruce up here and there. In all if you want to stay in central London for less than 80 this is the hotel for you. We will certainly stay here in future."
62,545,"May 25 2008 	Good value	The hotel is conveniently located near to Earls Court tube station - convenient access from Heathrow. Eating places, launderette and pharmacy are nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful. Has a comfortable lounge and bar. Room and bathroom were adequate size. Continental breakfast was plain but ample. Is in the London traffic congestion zone and has no parking. I would stay there again."
63,545,"May 23 2008 	Cut Your Expections in Half	It is often said you get what you pay for...and this is true about this hotel. While the U.S. Dollar is at a low point in value, many Americans still want to travel to London; but, usually look for hotels is a price range that fit their wallet. That was my situation and how I ended up staying at this hotel for four nights.The hotel is fairly well worn and the lobby is nothing special. The outside look of the hotel is better that its inside. The hotel is made up of a series of old Victorian homes and the narrow corridors with multiple fire doors makes navigating these halls very difficult when you have luggage in tow.The hotel's location is good, being just a short walk from the Earls Court tube station. There is a wide range of eateries, including fast food, in the neighborhood.Do not go to this hotel expecting a range of services...there are barely any. The WIFI service only works in the lobby so if you are traveling on business, I would hesitate to recommend this property to you.The TV reception in my room was like watching a blizzard on a tiny set. While the room was basic and clean, I regret the front desk staff were lacking in skills on how to be friendly. To rate this hotel two stars is a bit of a stretch. I have stayed in Motel 6's that are far superior to this property. I have learned my lesson, cut the ratings in half when it comes to Trip Advisor..."
64,545,"May 7 2008 	Bed infested with ticks.	We stayed in the Barkston Garden Hotel recently - have to say, it was dire. One of our party had bitemarks all over her legs and arms after sleeping in the beds, the rooms were gloomy and dirty and had a peculiar pong from them!Not worth it, even if you're on a budget - there are lots of decent budget hotels in London, this place is just a dump."
65,545,"Apr 16 2008 	Bleak and dreary just like the weather	I would like to preface this review with the fact that I found London to be the most depressing city that I have ever had the pleasure of visiting, and as such my opinions of the Barkston Gardens Hotel are coloured by my opinions. We stayed here as part of an around the world honeymoon for almost a week. We had a room on the 5th floor, at the back of the hotel. On arriving we discovered that the window had a gap in it and that the heater did not come on until after 5pm - not good when it is 10degrees celsius outside, and all you want to do is go to sleep! Our room was basic, although it did have a kettle with tea making facilities which we greatly appreciated. The breakfast was strange, with an entire ritual revolving around the maitre d for the breakfast room. If you speak limited English beware. Questions and requests by staff in the breakfast room to non-English speakers were treated with greatest aplomb and tact, shouted or yelled when these guests failed to understand the first time. Maybe some staff training in continental European languages such as Italian, French, German and even Japanese wouldn't go astray, perhaps???The one thing that the Barkston Gardens Hotel could immediately improve upon, is its customer service ethic. A smile or a more pleasant attitude at the check-in counter would have made most of our qualms with this hotel wash away immediately!That said, the price was good for London and the location is excellent - just around the corner from the Earl's Court Road tube station."
66,545,"Mar 30 2008 	Great Location Friendly staff	We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. (Check the Hotel Website for rates as they were cheaper than other sites we tried) We arrived around 9pm in the evening and found the reception staff to be very helpful. Breakfast is served on Weekdays from 7-9 and the continental breakfast offers basic but good and plentiful choice. We found that the decor in the room was a little tired, but the bathroom had been refurbished and was very clean, with fresh towels provided daily. After reading the reviews on this site we decided that we should shower in the evening, but the first morning we tried the shower and found that we had a lot of hot water, maybe this was because other guests were following the hotels advice to shower in the evening. There are a lot of choice of restaurants near to the hotel, we tried Zizzi (good for Pizza) and Masala Zone (where we shared a grand Thali). Lots of other choice in the area (Chinese, Japanese, Portugese, Hamburgers, French and more) Very handy if you have had a long day sightseeing and don't feel like going far for something to eat. The hotel is very close to Earls court Tube station, but it is situated just off Earls Court Road and there is not a lot of street noise. Check out was efficient, and we were able to leave our luggage and have another full day of sightseeing before returning to the hotel to collect the luggage. This hotel is very handy for sightseeing as you are able to access the Piccadilly line on the tube, Earls court tube station is in Zone 2 of the metro and travelling to the hotel was the only time that we travelled into Zone 2 (apart from a quick trip to portabella road.) All in all I would recommend this hotel for people travelling on a budget, who are looking for somewhere clean, comfortable, and in a good location."
67,545,"Mar 26 2008 	Very Nice	Stayed three nights at this hotel. Picked it because it was close to the tube station and busses. I was very happy with the location. The single room was suitable and I did not feel closed in. The hotel is old but the bathroom had been updated. Continental breakfast was included and enough to get a good start on the day. The staff was good and check in and out was simple. They also offer free internet! That was a plus just to keep in touch with family. I travel on my own and have a problem walking long distances so this hotel was the best for me. It was not the Ritz or Hilton, but the value was above average for being in London. I would definitely stay there again. I saw a lot of single travelers, couples and business people when I stayed. The worst thing for me is that they have central heating and at night the room was too hot. I had to open the window and because I was in the front of the hotel, heard all the noise from the traffic on the main road. Otherwise, I enjoyed the stay."
68,545,Mar 18 2008 	FIND Another hotel	Worst Hotel on EARTH! Poor check in and check out service. Basement room is the pits and hard to pull luggage up and down steps. Water pressure in our room was Great at all times but dirty bathroom.
69,545,"Mar 16 2008 	Find an alternate hotel!	Hotel had a sign stating that there were &quot;problems with running shower water between 7 - 9 a.m.&quot; We tried to alter our shower times, planning to shower in the evenings or afternoons but instead found NO hot water available at any time throughout the day. When we discussed this with the manager, our room was moved to an alternate one in the hotel - this time, the shower ran only a trickle of ice cold water any time of day or night. In addition, when we turned on the light in the morning there were roaches on our floor running for cover!! Ick! The TV plays only 5 channels (no alternatives like cable or movies) and internet access is only in the lobby/lounge area where there is no privacy to work. Location was great, but there are FAR more important things than only that - there are other alternatives near the tube throughout London that are reasonably priced - take one of those! Run, don't walk, from this spot. Finally, you should know that the photo run on all websites is NOT the hotel, it's a building across the street!! Talk about false advertising!!!"
70,545,"Mar 15 2008 	Avoid the basement rooms	Unfortunately we were given a basement room, it was very dark, and needed the lights on all the time. It was a big room, with bath and shower, but there was no heating in the bathroom, and the toilet was dirty at the bottom of the bowl. The breakfast was good, and it was very convenient for Earls Court underground."
71,545,"Mar 13 2008 	Water pressure still a problem............	We have just returned from a four night stay here. The location is spot on and just across the road from the tube station. There are plenty of pubs and restaurants. Would recommend Mango bar for 2-4-1 cocktails before 9pm (turn right out of hotel then left at Earls Court Road, its on right hand side just before O'Neills. Almost opposite is the restaurant As Greek as it gets, lovely meal - beware of charming Greek waiter who doesnt speak much English......we thought he was giving us free samples of chef's starters but it turned out we got complete starters! Probably more than we originally wanted, stuffed vine leaves and excellent meat balls, but they were lovely, followed by the mixed meat platter for 2 at 17 which was excellent. Dont go to Dinos Italian however, the meal was less than mediocre!Our room was 601, top floor at the back, so the view was not good! The room was a very good size but we have never heard floor boards that creak so much! We pitied the people who were staying in the room below us!The room and bathroom could definately do with refurbishing but were passable.............However...........we were not prepared for the lack of water..........Early morning there was no water at all from the hot tap on bathroom sink. The shower NEVER worked, so we just had baths - these did take over 30 mins to fill - quite a wait! The best time to take a bath we found was early evening - didnt take as long to fill the bath! The hotel reception does have a note up regarding the water pressure but we didnt expect it to be quite so bad!Continental breakfast was adequate, but the toast always seemed to be burnt! Overall good (ish) hotel for the price 59 per room per night incl continental breakfast (booked from the hotel website) especially for London!"
72,545,"Mar 3 2008	Think about what you want and set your expectations accordingly.	I stayed for 4 nights when visiting London with my wife to spend some time with our children. The location is excellent - 2 minutes walk from EC tube station. There is a very good choice of places to eat (including the hotel) within easy walking distance. Basic shops are handy - Boots, M&amp;S food, Sainsburys, Threshers, Somerfield etc. - so you can pick up your day's picnic provisions on your way to the tube.The hotel is old &amp; shabby, but it's clean and the TV in the room worked OK. The staff were very helpful and friendly, despite my having seen some of them receiving totally unjustified abuse from an African 'prima donna' type. This while they were &quot;going the extra mile&quot; to try and help her with her travel plans. I guess she was missing her slaves.Our room rate included 'continental breakfast', which was better than we expected. One morning we 'upgraded' to a full English breakfast for 4 each - and it saw us through the rest of the day. The fried bread was brilliant.During check in, it was pointed out to us that they were experiencing difficulties with the water supply, which meant reduced pressure &amp; airlocks, and that baths &amp; showers could be problematic during peak periods. As far as I could see, water pressure was poor 24/7, but we worked around it with a bit of patience. Had we checked in to the Best Western a few yards further along the road, I'm sure the plumbing would have been fine &amp; everything less shabby - but it wasn't worth the extra 20-30 per night to us.If you want a great location, decent breakfast, free wireless internet throughout the ground floor, a reasonably priced yet comfortable bar (with a free PC/Internet station) and somewhere clean and relatively cheap to rest your head then it's fine. If you want the 'branded chain' experience then pay for the logo &amp; don't stay here. It's London. The city is expensive, so set realistic expectations &amp; decide what matters to you."
73,545,"Feb 23 2008 	Great price and excellent location	My 6 year old daughter and I arrived early, before our room was available, but were greeted by friendly staff and were able to leave our bags in the office until we returned. The hotel is situated on a quiet street a mere 1 minute walk from Earl's Court underground station and has very handy banks, resturants, an M&amp;S and Boots etc. on the main road. The hotel itself was very clean, our room was spacious with 2 queen-sized beds, an armchair, kettle, TV and bathroom. Water pressue is a problem in the mornings so shower in the evening. The shower was very English style, so do not expect any power shower jets! Soap &amp; shampoo provided.Breakfast is self service overseen by a manager complete with bow-tie! Basic fare but eat all you like.Recommended."
74,545,"Feb 4 2008 	Excellent value pleasant experience	Excellent location (about 2 mins walk from Earls court tube station - which is a very good starting point to get around London). I was a little concerned about this hotel after reading reviews (I like my comfort) but we had a good experience.Check-in was quick efficient. The room was a good size, nice view over a small park and posh apartments. Good high ceilings and tv with usual 5 uk channels. The room also had kettle and teabags/coffee/milk/sugar etc. Conveniently, there was an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was large and very clean. The water in the shower was a bit low in pressure but when running for a couple of mins it was good. The floorboards were very creaky and yes carpets a bit worn but overall decor and room in general was quite good. We ordered breakfast one morning and it was fairly poor - 15 for 2 people. It wasn't quite what we had ordered and it was small and cheap. Given the location it's worth popping out for breakfast.The major attraction to this hotel is the price (about 135euro for 2 nights for 2 people). This is fantastic value for the location. We didn't have any problems whatsoever and would certainly return."
75,545,"Jan 28 2008 	1980s chic	The welcome to the Barkston Gardens was less than friendly and the rooms don't seem to have been decorated since the 80s. The carpet was worn and marked, and the throw on the bed was stained. The bathroom was very large and clean, however the water pressure could not be relied on and the shower did not always work. The location is excellent, just next to the tube station. Which is handy, as you probably won't want to hang around your room too long!"
76,545,"Jan 27 2008 	Great location clean hotel better price	The hotel is just a few steps from Earl's Court station in a very nice area.There are plenty of choices for your meals around the area.The rooms are clean , bathrooms have generous proportions if compared to hotels of its ranking.Definitively I would not mind staying there again if I return to London for vacations."
77,545,"Jan 24 2008 	Look Elsewhere...Please!	I've used this site for many years and this the first time i've been compelled to write a review.Check-in was problematic. After checking-in, we were told we couldn't have the room key until 2pm (at was 12.45pm). When we did get the room key, we found out someone else was already staying in the room!Finally got another key. Room itself was ok - good size.Real problems started the next day. No water - we couldn't even flush the toilet. Rang reception and they had to send someone to check! We were given a key to another room to have a shower. Key didn't work. When housekeeping let me in, still no water! Luckily had a friend staying in the basement (yes, rooms starting 100 are in the basement) whose shower did work.When we checked out, I asked for the manager. No sign of him/her. We were offered 20 but we demanded a full refund. This was refused and then it turned out we hadn't paid - just pre-authorised the amount. We left and will never return.I don't like giving bad reviews, but this hotel was a disgrace. I haven't even gone into the number of people we also heard complaining about various things who were virtiually shouted at by the receptionist.I was embarrased to be British as it gave such a bad impression of accommodation in this country."
78,545,"Dec 12 2007	A real bargain	Make no mistake, this hotel is not perfect. The mattress sagged a little, the carpet was worn, and everything was very plain. But for the price, it's an *incredible* bargain. We stayed in central London for about 50 pounds a night. We had feared the place would be flyblown and bedbug-infested, but it was perfectly clean and serviceable. We would definitely stay there again."
79,545,"Nov 22 2007 	Okay for the price	This hotel has a fantastic location in Earl's Court with really large bedrooms with high ceilings and large bathrooms. The property is in dire need of renovation in that the carpets, both in the hallways and the bedrooms are very worn and stained. The bedroom furniture is basic and the beds could do with upgrading. Having said that the rooms are spotlessly clean with clean linen and tea and coffee facilities. The bar is basic and serves snacks and light meals with very friendly staff.Compared to other hotels available in Earls Court this hotel is good value."
80,545,"Nov 5 2007 	Nice Hotel Great Location	This was my fist trip to London. I booked the hotel thru the website lastminutetravel.com. Upon arrival, the front desk could not find my reservation. I presented the voucher that I printed from the website. The hotel stored my luggage while they worked out the issue and I took a walk for about one hour in the neighborhood, which is exceptional. A coworker recommended Earls Court, which turned out to be spot on! Not only was the tube station right around the corner from the hotel, but also the main street, which has all the amenities that you would need (banks, restaurants, pubs, cafes). Upon returning, they had the problem rectified and I checked into my room. The room was somewhat typical of other 3-star European hotels that I stayed at. The only issues I can recall is that the comforter on the bed had a rip in it, and the floors were somewhat creaky. Making for some distraction when trying to fall asleep at night, but it wasnt completely awful by any means. I had my breakfast in the hotel almost every day, which was included in the price of the room. I took advantage of this since the exchange rate from US to GBP was 2:1 at the time (worse today). If I were to return I would consider this hotel again only because the price was right and the location was fantastic. However, I would also take a look at some other alternatives for a few more coins."
81,545,"Nov 2 2007 	Perfect location lovely room	I stayed in this hotel and I have to say, I was very surprised: room was very clean, breakfast was very good, staff was very helpful and friendly. Location wise it is brilliant, you can go around London easily and the underground is literally one minute walking distance from the hotel (district, circle and piccadilly line). I really suggest to book this hotel if you are looking for a nice, handy and not 5 star place to stay in London."
82,545,Oct 24 2007	Don't stay here. Dirty Worn down smelly	Apart form location everything here is negative. I paid US$116 through hotwire. They rate it 3 star. It is not even 2 star. Small rooms. Mice in the lobby.Stay away from this hotel.
83,545,"Oct 14 2007 	Needs a renovation	We were happy with the location of this hotel. Quiet neighborhood at night, but just around the corner was a bustling street with great pubs, restaurants, markets, bus stop and a subway station.We had a room on the top floor. It was spacious but quite shabby. The floor was filthy with stains (We got the impression that the room was being cleaned, it was just aged), it squeaked horribly every step we took, the double bed was so small my 6ft tall husbands feet were hanging off the bed, the bathroom fan was noisy (it wouldn't turn off), and the shower water fluctuated from burning hot to icy cold while showering.Overall, it was a pretty sad condition for a hotel costing more than one hundred a night."
84,545,Oct 11 2007	How many roaches?	The first night I noticed roaches in the bathroom. Went to front desk and asked to switch rooms. The manager on duty asked me &quot;How many roaches?&quot;......That question puzzled me because I typically sent a limit of zero in the number of roaches I wish to see in my hotel room
85,545,"Sep 28 2007 	loved this hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights this August and were very pleased with our accommodations. The room and the bathroom were very surprisingly large (considering that we paid 50 pounds per for twin room). Everything was very clean and we had all toiletries replaced as required. The only problem was that the room was on the first floor with the windows to the street, so it could be quite noise in the evening. I must say that we were so tired every day that it did not ruin our vacation. The location is very convenient: 2 mins to the subway and there are several fast food places around (a necessary when you are traveling with a teenager) plus a pharmacy, Marks and Spencer and some sit- down restaurants (we liked ZiZi). This hotel is also only 5-7 minutes to Marriot Kensington hotel from were most of the tour agencies can pick you up for day tours. Definitely will be staying there again."
86,545,"Sep 14 2007 	good hotel	Excellent location,right next to the tube. Had a twin room on the first floor. Check-in was excellent, Keycard entry to the rooms.The room was large. Beds were good,a very good hotel for what u pay,will be staying there again."
87,545,"Aug 29 2007 	""Staff"" were awful	I stayed here thank GOD for only 1 night. I tried to check in early (9:30AM) and they said I would have to pay for one night's (the previous night) and the rate is USA dollar's, get this: $310 USD! IT WAS AWFUL. AVOID....AND on Expedia they rank this as a 3 star (NOT!) Expedia asked me to rate my stay, I CERTAINLY DID!!!!"
88,545,"Aug 26 2007	Nice Option on a budget	A little worn around the edges but was quiet, clean and comfortable at an affortable price for London. Just around the corner from 2 Pubs(with food), tons of Restaurants(sit down and fast food), internet cafes (cheap long distance calls) a laundromat, a Marks and Spencer, a Boots, the Earl's Court Tube and numerous bustops(#74 is one I remember). Was upgraded from a twin room to a family room at no extra cost. Dan at the front deck was very helpful at check-in. Breakfast was very basic and dull but was included in the price and you could upgrade to a full English one if so desired. Would recommend this Hotel as a good Budget option with a great location near restaurants and the Tube."
89,545,"Aug 11 2007	Quiet and excellent loaction.	Stayed here 4 one week.Excellent location, less than 4 minutes from the tube. And located on a quiet street.Stayed in a twin room on the ground floor. Close to the dining room.Check-in was fast and efficient. Keycard entry to the rooms.The room was clean and of a good size. Beds were comfy and had clean sheets and duvets. The sheets had a couple holes in them and the pillows were rather flat and not firm at all.The room was tastefully decorated.There were tea/coffee facilites but the complimentary biscuits were not the freshest.There was a trousers press in the room and an iron and board was available at reception.Usual TV, with standard 5 channels with good reception and a working remote.The ensuite was big and clean, but only had a shower. The shower was powerful but drained very slowly, u ended standing in a pool. I reported the problem to reception and they sorted it.But then we noticed that it began to leak......we ended putting newspaper down to soak up the excess water. And on a few nights i saw small roaches. But i guess that was due to the fact of being so close to the kitchen and the leaking bathroom.There was body/shampoo provided.The first few nights were hot but in most hotels in london there was no AC or fans. But with the window open it was ok.We had complimentary continental breakfast in our deal (67 pn)Included cereals,yogort,cheese,ham and fruits.Breakfast was run by the matre de, who ran a prompt and efficient service and the waitresses were aso very polite.Full english was available at 8.50.The lobby as nice and there was a large reception room, where u can watch tv, read the complimentary newspapers or magazines.Free wifi was available, which was fast.The hotel is located in an area, with restaurants/ ATMs/Pharmacy and every other shop u may need.I found the staff overall very helpful and polite. I misplaced my keycard on the last night....i came back in a 1130pm and it was replaced with out any hesitation.I left my brand new mobile phone in the room by mistake, went into london, when i came back the bed was made and my phone was placed on the bed for me.Because of the honesty of the staff and how polite they were, I am able to overlook the bathroom problems.....Nice comfy hotel, at a good price in an ideal loaction. Would stay here again."
90,545,"Jun 27 2007 	Spacious rooms and excellent location	Barkston Gardens Hotel is an old hotel situated only 1 minute from Earl's Court Tube Station. The location is unbeatable; the area is pleasant and safe and packed with nice restaurants (try the &quot;Little French Restaurant&quot; on Hogarth Rd nearby, they serve three course dinner for only 10), supermarkets and shops. The reception is very large and well maintained and so is the breakfast/dining room. Breakfast is buffet style and consists of tea/coffee, fruit juice, cerals, bread rolls, toast and marmalade/cheese/ham. Twin rooms are the largest I have experienced in London; I have visited this city at least 50 times and thus tried numerous hotels. Non-smoking rooms are situated on 4th floor but make sure to be very specific when asking for one, I did but upon arrival I was informed that they had missed my request. However, they managed to fix that after the first night. If you want a quiet room, ask for one facing the backyard. I have stayed at Barkston Gdns Hotel four times, both in summer and in winter, and will certainly return again. A big minus for the very worn plastic carpet in the bathrooms though. Staff is mostly efficient and helpful. Be careful at check-out however, if you are paying with a non-British credit card they will charge you in your local currency - at a not very good rate. Ask them to charge you in  Sterling instead and save money.In all a decent hotel with excellent location. Don't hesitate to go there but don't expect it to be like Hilton."
91,545,"Jun 20 2007 	Smelly on the ground floor	Stayed from 17th-19th of June, booked on [--] and it looked reasonable. We were staying on the ground floor near the dining room, smelly smelly Smelly is all I can say about it. Perhaps they reserve these rooms for people like us who booked through a booking agency....No fan in the toilet so it got even more smelly quickly, the carpet was ill fitting (coming off the stairs) and worn. One of our party was all bites over her legs from the bed fleas.It has a good location and one could overlook the tattiness if it didn't smell, but for giving one of us a bad dose of bites, the Barkston Gardens gets one out of five. Don't stay here if you don't book direct!"
92,545,"Jun 6 2007 	Great Location	I considered &quot;excellent&quot;, but we asked, when making our reservation, for two twin beds and got a double. Location was excellent - within 2 blocks a great place for breakfast, a post office, cash machine andbank. Underground also within 2 blocks. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! The room was 'interesting' to get to,sort of like a maze, but once there, the room was about as spacious as one gets in Europe. I would definitely stay there again. A Marks and Spencer was close by, too, for those who might want to buy food to go like fresh fruit cut in bite size pieces, or croissants, individual botted drinks, etc. Sort of a glorified 7-11 and much fresher food! My husband thought the bed was lousy, but I was OK withit. This hotel is definitely worth your consideration."
93,545,"Jun 5 2007 	Loved it	We stayed here for 5 nights in April on our honeymoon. We were pleasantly surprised after hearing some negative reviews. The room we were in (although the door wouldn't open all the way due to the bed being in the way) was clean and looked out onto the gardens - really made us feel like we were in London.The bathroom was massive and also really clean. Although the decor wasn't beautiful, I'm really fussy when it comes to cleanliness and sleeping in strange beds, but in this place I had no problem.There's also an internet downstairs in the bar which is free to use. Sometimes we'd have to wait, but not for long. The internet is quick to use and the room isn't too nosiy to use it in.One of the best things was the breakfast. The room is nice, and they give you a pot of coffee or tea along with a rack of toast. You can then eat cereal, croissants, cheeses, fruit, yoghurt, juice....there's plenty and it's done really nicely. It was our favourite breakfast in the whole of Europe.Also, as others have mentioned it's really close to Earls Court Station - it takes less than 2 minutes to walk. So if you come by plane, get the tube from the airport to Earls Court. It takes only half an hour and is much cheaper than paying for taxi. We loved it here. Don't go expecting a glamorous hotel, but if you want something clean, affordable and convenient then this is the place for you. We'd definitely go back."
94,545,"May 7 2007 	Good value	Adequate sized double room and en suite bathroom, if a little dated but clean and comfortable. Basic continental breakfast included in a good value for money package.Staff friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a very well served area for shops and restaurants and 2 minutes from the Underground station.The only downside was the incredibly creaky floorboards everywhere. If you cannot get a room on the top floor, just hope that the occupants above you weigh less than 6 stone and are not training for a marathon! Take earplugs if you are a light sleeper."
95,545,"May 3 2007 	Great Value for Money for a London Hotel	As others have said, the hotel is not outstanding, however it is a good price, clean (if rather well worn) and extremely well situated. When I stayed I was in a large twin room with views out over roof-tops (not over the garden). It was quiet and perfectly adequate for our needs. The staff were extremely friendly and there was plenty for breakfast (even if it does showcase the more stereotypical view of English food). You are right next to Earl's Court so on my upcoming trip to London for a show at Earl's Court I have chosen to stay there again. The price and location are difficult to beat."
96,545,"Apr 21 2007	Do not stay here!	I stayed at this property in April 2003 with my wife, son and brother in law and I am still angry. Do not stay here! It is advertised as a superior property and it is not. Nice location and good view of the park from the front of the hotel. Very poor value for the money. I was injured at the hotel and was denied medical attention by the manager on duty. Actually I was berated by the manager on duty. JS"
97,545,"Apr 16 2007 	Over Rated	This is a run down hotel - don't be fooled by the pictures. Probably above average for the Earl's Court area , but not much else. Close to the tube stop. Worth spending more to get to Central London."
98,545,"Apr 16 2007 	absolutely fine	Stayed here for 2 nights on 13/4 and 14/4 with my girlfriend. We had a lovely big room on the third floor. I've never seen such a large, bright room in a London hotel! I paid 118 pounds for the whole stay inc. breakfast. The hotel had friendly staff, is in an excellent location, and was very quiet. There is a nice little bar and pleasantdining room serving a good breakfast. I was very worried by some of the bad reviews i'd read but I have nothing to complain about. I willstay here again and would recommend it to anyone, particularly room 509. Thanks to the hotel for a lovely weekend."
99,545,"Apr 6 2007 	Absolutely Disgusting	A health hazard. Stay here at you peril.I arrived at the hotel at seven in the morning (note that the postcode provided by the hotel is incorrect). Check in was at two in the afternoon, but the hotel had a secure storage room for me to store my luggage. This was the first of two good things about the hotel.When I came back in the afternoon I was booked into a twin share room in the basement (even though I had booked a single). To get to this room I had to walk past the dining area, through a set of double doors and down two flights of stairs. As I walked through the second of the double doors I got the shock of my life. The air stank of cigarette smell! Not only did it stink to high heaven, but it smelt like it had been around since World War Two! The smell continued all the way down into the basement and into my room.The room was surprisingly large - too large really for my needs. The sheets in the beds were clean, but I'd say the bedcovers were well and truly due for their yearly bath. The bathroom was adequate. All in all I'd say the state of the room was reasonable, but this doesn't mean much if you can't breath!After spending the last forty-something hours in transit from country Australia and then walking around London, I did not have the energy to complain. I collapsed and woke up six hours later choking and wheezing from the cigarette fumes. I tried to get more sleep but it was impossible.I spent the next couple of days snorting black soot out of my nose. After washing my clothes a couple of times I still couldn't get the smell out of them.The second of the good thing about the hotel was the breakfast. The service and the food were excellent - not enough to get me through the front door again though. Stay at the York Hotel instead."
100,545,"Mar 30 2007	Really good value for money	This hotel is a perfect place if you are looking for a lower budget but still decent. I suspect some of the negative reviews are written by people that are or competition or have no idea what you can get for different price-levels in London.The location on a side street of Earl's Court road and 2 min form Earl's Court tube station is excellent. The area is really nice with lot's of restaurants at all price-levels and food types and also nicepubs (I went yesterday to the Blackbird which is round the corner) with mixed public but a lot of trendy people, young professionals let's say.Then the staff is very friendly. They have loads of adapters so you can connect your stuff to the UK mains system. Instead of charging you 25$ a day (which they did once to us in Hilton LAX) they ask you a deposit of 10 pounds that you get back when you return it. A half pint beer costs only 1.50 pounds.The wireless access if you have a laptop, or the available workstation is fantastic. I am here on business and I am working all day here looking out on the garden, which is in front of the building, accross the street, not on the back.My room was good, clean, the bed very comfortable, the shower with lot's of hot water. Of course, for this price (I paid 57 pounds incl. breakfast) the furniture is not supernice design or supernew, but it works and it is clean. What else do you need? The room even has a press to press your pants.Next time when I stay in London for business I definitely come back."
101,545,"Dec 27 2006 	Overall not bad - some rooms nicer than others!	My friends and I stayed here on 2 separate occasions (during 1 week), and each time we had 2 rooms. So we saw 4 different rooms altogether, and I can tell you that your satisfaction will depend largely on the room you're assigned! It's a very oddly shaped building (or conglomeration of buildings), and some rooms are much roomier and easier to get to than others. Overall the place was clean, pleasant and well located. Don't stay here on your honeymoon, but it's a good base if you're planning to spend your days sightseeing. Yes, it smelled of smoke, but so does everything in Europe; the interiors were shabby, but again, that's Europe. And the free wireless in the lobby/bar area was a very nice perk. In our experience, the rooms with one double bed were much nicer than the rooms with 2 single beds, so keep that in mind if you're traveling with someone you don't mind sharing a bed with!"
102,545,"Nov 14 2006 	The poorest hotel I have ever stayed in.	Suggested by Travel agent in Australia and we are reporting back to them not to use Barkston Gardens for future bookings. We had the most run down room, broken bedside lamps, and old shabby dusty overhead drapping/swag, lumpy old disgusting mattress and pillows, ill fitting drapes on the windows. My husband slept on the floor for three nights of the week we were booked in, we requested to the Manager for another room with single beds and he said the whole of the hotel was booked out and to ask again in the morning which we did, not to him as he was not there but to his second in charge and was told there were three twin rooms not booked by anybody and we would have to talk to him later which we did and again he insisted this time that because it was a booking through the travel agent in Australia that we could not change the booking even though my husband was very willing to pay any extras, we were not looking for refunds just an enjoyable and restfull time in London. And I will not be recommending any of our friends or those who read this to stay there."
103,545,"Nov 10 2006 	I second what a dump!	Warning do not go here! This hotel was a complete disappointment. The only plus is the one other reviewers have mentioned in that it's close to the tube. The room was bigger than those in Europe and bathroom was quite large.. We stayed on the fourth floor and it needs a re-do. Did not want to touch anything, the bedspreads, curtains, carpet and chairs were filthy and very worn out. The windows don't close all the way letting in cold air, it got so cold I asked the desk how we turn on the radiator in room, he said you don't, but gave me a small room heater. Doesn't look anything like the picture, picture makes it look like it's out in the country away from things, it is not and there seemed to be alot of traffic noise for having a small park across the street from it. Have pic showing park just outside of hotel"
104,545,"Nov 4 2006 	What a Dump	What a Dump! I was booked there for four nights at the end of October thru Brit Air. The room was reeking of mold and had rotten spots in the floorboards. The whole bathroom and especially the shower was festooned with mold. The desk people were surly and unresponsive and made no effort to at least get the mold neutralized in the bathroom and would not provide an alternate room. Maybe they don't like Brit Air customers- London hotel rooms are rarely a good value compared to any first world country but this room and hotel don't even qualify as third world. What a Dump! I see this hotel belongs to the Cairn group and if this is an example of their management competence, all their hotels should be avoided."
105,545,"Nov 1 2006 	What's the fuss all about?	I booked a single en suite with continental breakfast for 65 pounds/night via venere.com. My room was great--clean, decent bed, and had a kettle and complimentary tea/coffe/cookies. The front desk was kind enough to bring me an electric heater when I called down--the heat isn't on this early in the season, and I'm from California so I have zero tolerance for cold! The staff was helpful, the hotel was clean and inviting. I couldn't have picked a more convienient location--close to Earl's Court tube station, food stores, a small grocery, and several pubs. I'd definitely stay there again, and would encourage friends to do so also."
106,545,"Oct 5 2006 	Basic but good hotel	I have stayed at the Barkston Gardens Hotel a few times now. The main reason being that is a two minute walk to Earls' Court Underground station which connects you onto the district line and piccadily line - great for eating and shopping in Covent Garden or going to see a show - ie Phantom of the Opera.The staff are very friendly - for example my flight was delayed and then travelled up from gatwick airport and there were queues everywhere, i arrived at the hotel at 11am and asked if i could leave my luggage only to be told that my room was ready of me to check in to! Breakfast is also good. The restaurant serves beautiful food, only thing is it is nearly always empty and sometimes it is a long wait - but worth it.I would agree that the hotel needs redecorated and new bathrooms, but when you pay 45 - 55 for a room in london you can't really compain.I would recommend the hotel to people on budget and want it as base for a trip to London."
107,545,"Sep 25 2006 	Glad there are mixed reviews!!!	We just got back from staying in London for 3 nights. We stayed at another hotel on the same street back in May, so I could compare. We paid 9 pounds more at this hotel (79 pounds for a twin - 2 people). I was worried when I found out that my son and I would be in a lower level (basement) room...but after going through several &quot;Fawlty Tower&quot; hallways and firedoors, we found the stair way down to our room. The room was better than I had anticipated on our way down. It was spacious, reasonable light and ventilization, although there wasn't a window in the bathroom. The bathroom and the bedroom were both in good repair. The TV was pretty small...but that's not why we travelled to London. And location...Earl's Court is a terrific compromise between price and convenience. I was concerned about writing too positive of a review, because I know that we will probably return, and I didn't want the hotel to raise their rates! I guess it really comes down to the room you are assigned. And fortunately, we won out this time!"
108,545,"Sep 22 2006 	I have to question everyone who liked it	I stayed in this hotel a few years ago and it was a dump. There is no other way to describe it. I was in London for a few days and I changed right away and learned immediately that when it comes to hotels, the terms, Nice, affordable and London or even adequate, affordable and London are oxymorons. Anyway, the Barkston Terrace by any criteria was a dump. When people describe this as great, I have to question their judgment. How do I describe a dump, well, the creaky floors, the window that opened up to some grimy backstreet, an ugly carpet that didn't mask the creaking, a window that had to be forced open and held open by a stick, the tininess of the room, I mean, I could go on and on. I find these places insulting except that they are all like this, I have yet to find an affordable, nice room of a decent size in London. Also the service was totally indifferent: I called the UK expedia number to change the hotel and it cost me eleven pounds, even though it was a local number.Who knows, maybe its better now, although I doubt it."
109,545,"Sep 14 2006	Stay somewhere else	The only plus with this hotel is the location. It is only 2 mins walk to the Earl's Court underground station.The room we stayed was horrible. -Transparent (sheer) curtain on bathroom window (the window is big and facing the bathtub. I have to get undress/dress behind the shower curtain, standing inside the bathtub).-Extremely noisy. People yelling from the street (I dont think it is a good neighborhood) and you can always hear sirens from police car early morning and late night. You can also hear truck coming to pick-up trash in the morning.-Paint in the bathroom is peeling off-Wallpaper in the room is peeling off-Big stain on blanket-Rotten wood window frame-Dirty carpet-Dusty hair blow dryerOne thing we found funny is the mirror. It was cut from a big mirror (you can tell from the design and the cutting) and put in a picture frame. Another room probably have the other half."
110,545,"Sep 7 2006 	Location location	If you want a cheap clean hotel in central London this is the place for you. The hotel is just around the corner from Earl's Court underground station, in a very quiet side street overlooking a park. With Earl's Court providing direct lines to Heathrow airport and all the sights of London it is an ideal base for a few days sightseeing.The hotel itself is basic but clean, with very friendly, helpful staff. They provide free wireless internet in the foyer and the breakfast is above average. All in alll a great place to stay in central London for the budget conscious traveller."
111,545,"Aug 29 2006 	Great value	Stayed here over Bank Holiday weekend as I was attending a course. Booked through the hotel's good website the day before I checked in and got a good rate of 57 a night.I was impressed with my room. As it was just me, and the room stated single, I wasn't expecting much. Had a comfortable double bed, tv, hairdryer, kettle, coffee, tea, desk, comfy chair, and a spacious bathroom with an incredibly powerful shower.Most impressive was the high ceiling, which sounds silly but makes the rooms seem so much bigger. And judging by a fire evacuation map, my room was one of the smallest.Maid service was great, check in was Ok, not great but no problems. Breakfast fine, no frills but for the price no complaints. Best of all - location! 1min walk to Earls Court tube which is on the Picc and District lines, so it's very easy to get anywhere. And loads of shops and restaurants on your doorstep - tesco, boots, all the fast foods, pubs etc. The hotel is just off a busy main road, and opposite a quiet garden. There is a bit of noise, but not at night, and remember, this is central london!I had a great stay, and would recommend this hotel to budget-conscious people who don't want to compromise on comfort."
112,545,"Aug 20 2006	Good value for London	We stayed at the Barkston Gardens in the Earl's Court section of London, the last week of July 2006.I had read many reveiws both on TripAdvisor and other places, so did not have any great preconceived notions. It is a fairly basic hotel. Right around the corner from the Underground, and very convenient to many shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is nothing really special, but, by London standards was more than adequate. We were there during a heat wave, and there is no air conditioning. I knew this going in, and, had taken the time to email the hotel several months in advance, specifically requesting a fan. When we first checked in, we were told there was no way to guarantee a fan until the morning when people checked out, so the maids could find one and bring it to us. The first room we were given was a smoking room, without a fan, and quite small. We switched to another 9non-smoking) room, which was somewhat larger and had a fan - although it was basically ineffectual, but, better than none at all.The bed was full size, and okay. The room was equipped with an electric tea kettle, but the instant coffee was awful. The tea was fine. The bathroom was very roomy, but oddly, had a half glass shower &quot;curtain&quot;. I was with my husband, but, if you are modest about showering, it is a bit odd, not to mention water got all over the floor. The shower pressure was great.The hotel has a breakfast, which was good, and a small bar with one computer with internet access. They also have free wireless in the common areas too. The TV in the room only got a few stations, but, we didn't really care. Overall, it was very convenient, and served our purposes fine. With everything so expensive in London, we preferred to spend our money on our experiences, and dinners, rather than a lavish hotel. I would reccomend this hotel to other travelers. It's a good value for the money."
113,545,"Aug 13 2006	What a location	I would like to start off by stating my girlfriend and i traveled all throughout europe and stayed at many different locations If you follow my user idea you will be able to figure out our trip and you could use this as a guideline for yourself. We did tons of research and used all the sites to make our choices. I hope this review helps.The Barkston Gardens hotel is a few short minute walk from the Earls Court train station, which is a train station with many different train lines running right through it. The location is wonderful and in a great area where you will find many bars and many places where you will be able to find fresh fruit, bread and basic nessaities. Now for the hotel, the staff was very friendly and were eager to help out with directions throughout the city. Our room was clean (but we did find an unused condom wrapper under the bed, it would be hard for cleaning staff to reach or see it but it was still found) and the washroom meet all basic needs. Our room was small and only had windows that opened and a small personal size fan. NO AIR in this one, but as long as your not there for a heat wave you should be fine, london is cool (23c) most of the time anyhow. We think the room we had was a 1 person room. Overall i would stay there again but only for a few nights, we found that hotels that were cheaper but more out of the way had more extras, like ac and bigger rooms.PS. Our flight arrived in london at 9am and reached the hotel at 11, we asked if there was a room to store our things while our room was being preparied. They placed our bags in an easy access room which made us feel alittle uneasy but the staff reinsured us that the bags will be fine. Nothing happened to the bags but just wanted to state this just incase you are in our shoes and plan to arrive before the check in"
114,545,"Jul 25 2006	A good experience	We stayed at the Barkston Gardens in Kensington, London at the beginning of June 2006. Apart from the rather unfriendly frontdesk staff, it was a good experience. Our room was clean, the size adequate, and the overall impression fine. We can recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a conveniently situated (minutes from Earl's Court station) hotel at affordable rates.M de Villiers, South Africa"
115,545,"Jul 5 2006	Great locationQuaint and Quiet	Went to London for Wimbledon tennis but did not want to stay too near to it though.Train came in at Euston and it was so easy to use the tube stations. Arrived at Earl's Court tube and Barkston Gardens Hotel was across the road and turn left. Did not have to travel far to find it. A pleasant Hotel, very quaint and quiet. Room was big enough.Tea and coffee facilities on hand. Choice of complimentary continental breakfast or English for a couple of pounds more. Bed was very comfortable. Room was hot no air-con but they do have a fan in the room which was good. It is probably not usually this hot in England, so it would probably be ok any other time of the year but we did go in between the 5 day heatwave that they had. It was in the 30's. Just got back to the North of England to find that tennis is called off because of rain. Staff where very friendly and at our request they let us put our coolpacks in the freezer overnight. Hotel very close to Restaurants and other eateries. Also foodstores and an open 24hr Tesco. Would stop at this Hotel again."
116,545,"Jul 4 2006	Convenient location but disappointing hotel	We stayed at this hotel for two nights as we were going to watch the tennis at Wimbledon. The location is great in terms of convenience for the tube and proximity of restaurants and shops (ie Boots, M&amp;S, Somerfield) However the hotel itself was disappointing. It was really quite tatty and the cleanliness of the room left a lot to be desired, especially in the bathroom. We were also surprised to find that dinner and room service stopped being served at 9.30pm. The staff weren't overly helpful either. Our room was also very hot and noisy at night but that's to be expected in London during the summer. Overall this hotel was fine as a base in which to sleep and shower and we were glad to be so near to Earl's Court Tube Station but it is let down by its shabby appearence, lack of cleanliness and heat and noise levels."
117,545,"Jun 29 2006	Excellent location and very quiet	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights in early June 2006. The location, as others have commented, is good and convenient if you travels around by the Underground. The room and washroom are clean and the space is adequate for us. But my room (X08, not facing the garden) is really hot, especially in the afternoon. Opening the window widely (all day long) did not help much, and I think it is the major problem (well, in this room you can see the sunset). Remember that the room is not air-conditioned. Some of the staff were helpful but others were just okay."
118,545,"May 18 2006	Perfect jumping off point for touring London	After reading some of the more recent reviews here, I decided to book a room in this hotel for my 3 days of sightseeing around London. I booked directly through the hotel's Web site and got a really good deal that included the continental breakfast (which is nothing impressive but definitely enough food &amp; choices to take you through to lunch). My room was a small single - plenty of room for me and my luggage - with a nice roomy bathroom. It was cheery, clean, and comfortable, but I did lose all hot water during my last shower. My theory is that you may be better off showering at night, opposite of most guests, probably, so there may be more hot water available. My room was very, very warm, so I left the window open day &amp; night, and the problem was solved. I was fortunate that it hardly rained at all - not sure that solution would have worked if rain was being blown in. It's as quiet as everyone else said, so no traffic or people noise to wake you up when the window's open. The garden view is so pretty. It's ridiculously close to Earl's Court tube station - couldn't be more convenient. And that Marks &amp; Spencer Simply Food market a block away came in handy many times! Staff were very friendly and helpful. There's a computer with Internet access in a room off the lobby but it's usually busy - but there's also a McDonald's (ugh, I know!) with an Internet cafe attached on the way to the tube stop. I recommend this hotel as a comfortable, affordable tourist-class hotel. Not many frills but a lot of charm and a very nice neighborhood."
119,545,"Apr 1 2006	Good value but nothing exciting.	This hotel had a great location and was a good value for the money. The room was small and a bit worn, but clean. Breakfast was good and the staff were polite and helpful. If you're budget-conscious and don't plan to spend a LOT of time hanging around your hotel, the Barkston Gardens is a fine place to stay if you get a reasonable price."
120,545,"Feb 20 2006	Fine hotel 	This hotel was in a very nice neighbourhood, close to bookstore and drugstores. It was a bit out of the way for me, but I would recommend it if the location is good for you. Very brightly painted walls!"
121,545,"Dec 22 2005	Barkston Gardens--Okay for Budget Travelers	My room was very small, but considering it was just me, it was no big deal. Comfortable bed, bathroom and shower in the room, desk, television, phone, and room service (for an additional cost). Breakfast was included in the price of the room and it was very good. The service was okay. The hotel is located two minutes from the Earl's Court tube station, which is a plus. It's not the Ritz, but good for budget travelers."
122,545,Oct 20 2005	good customer serviceold hotelnasty bathroom	i was in london on summer vacation from august 3rd to the 8th.I decided to go to the barkston hotel because it came up as a three star hotel when i looked on line.I noticed that they have a very good customer service..however the rooms are small and too ugly.There was something wrong with the bathroom..the hot water does not mix with the cold water which makes it really hard to take a shower.You get one side of the tap pouring out water as hot as hell and the otherside of the same tap with cold water.The hotel has a nice location but they need to do a whole lot of renovation.
123,545,"Oct 19 2005	Decent great location	I stay in London often. You have to understand the baseline hotel there is way below most places. But over the last few years they seem to be trying to improve. The Barkston is one example. This hotel has free wireless access and hair dryers. There is someone at the desk 24 hours. The breakfast room is large and clean. The breakfast is plenty to eat, with croissants, cheese, ham, yogurt, and canned fruit. A full cooked breakfast is 2 GBP more. The rooms are en suite, and there is a lift. About half the rooms are large. Ask for Room 405, which is a large twin with a full bath. Some of the rooms on the first floor are very noisy. Weekdays are downright cheap at about 58 GBP; weekends are a lot more. The Earl's Court location is the absolute best, as you can catch the Circle, District, or Picadilly lines. The tube from Heathrow goes direct for 2.40 and takes 30 minutes. There are three good pubs, an M &amp; S Food Only shop, and a wine shop within 50 yards. All in all, not a bad place to stay."
124,545,"Sep 19 2005	Good for the price	I booked online at a good price, and for the room and location got a good deal. The room was a single en-suite and was quite a good size. But this hotel is still in an old shape...creaky floorboards, a bit aged decor... etc you get the picture. The location is great...just around the corner from the tube stop. My room looked out on the gardens which was nice. I think I was on the top floor and if it had been a sweltering day I woul dhave had a problem without air conditioning. Oh and the lift would take ages to come."
125,545,"Jun 2 2005	Gret Value for Money	Stayed at the Barkstone Gardens Hotel after attending a concert at Earls Court....what a great idea as 10,000 people tried to cram onto the tube afterwards. Id read other reviews of on TripAdvisor and wasnt disappointed. Location wise its 200m from the underground and 5-10mins walk from Earls Court exhibition centre on a relatively quiet tree lined square. True its not the flashest of places, especially in the public areas - the carpet was a little worn and some of the paint could have done with attention, but the room was relatively modern, clean, quiet, comfortable and very large for central London. Whats more it comes with duvets on the bed and a television, trouser press, hairdryer and TV that all work! At 59 for a double on a laterooms I think the place was a bargain. I think the full price is 105 which in itself isnt unreasonable if you have cause to be in this part of London. Earls Court has so many &quot;dumps&quot; where you get ripped off that I think the Barkstone Gardens is a real find and wouldnt hesitate to stay here again."
126,545,"May 24 2005	You can stay at much better places for similar money.	Stayed here for one night in May 2005 when attending a concert at the nearby Earls Court arena.POSITIVES:Location - 1 minutes walk to Earls Court tube station. 2 minutes to Earls Court Arena.Cleanliness - Both the room and the bed were clean.Staff - Friendly and helpful.NEGATIVES:No Air-Conditioning - the room was impossibly hot. What made it worse was the window wouldn't stay open unless I propped it open with the telephone directory.Overall condition of Hotel - I think the hotel can be described as a little bit tatty. The marble floor in reception was cracked. The carpet in the corridors was faded and ill-fitting. The paintwork and decor was overdue an overhaul (woodchip wall paper for example - this is not the 70's anymore!). 1 inch gap below room door meant light from the corridor illuminated the room all night.OVERALL VERDICT: There are much better hotels in London for this price - I paid 88GBP for one night. This is not very expensive for London, but if you shop around you'll find some of the major hotel chains offering genuine 4* rooms for this price."
127,545,"Oct 11 2004	Great for the price	I've stayed at this hotel twice. The rooms are a little older, but were decent for the money paid. The location was perfect, a 3 min walk to the tube station. Some rooms in the hotel are large, and some are small. All in all, not bad for a tourist class hotel."
128,545,"Aug 19 2004	Awful location filthy rooms	We stayed at Barkston Gardens in the first week of August. it was so bad we went looking for an alternative for the next night despite the fact we had prepaid. We had 2 rooms, for 2 nights, both were filthy, in one room the toilet wouldn't flush, the noise was incredible, even the kids complained! The street outside was covered in vomit and broken beer bottles my 9yo daughter was verbally sexually harassed as we walked passed the pub and was so frightened she wouldn't open the window on her room despite the hot weather! Location might be alright if you're into bars and pubs but not for a family. my biggest gripe was the fact they gave their adddress as Kensington as it is an entirely different type of neighbourhood"
129,545,"Mar 23 2004	Great Location	Location was truly the best part of this hotel. Earl's court tube station literally right around the corner. The room we had was another story. Great bathroom, large, full tub, great shower w/ shower curtain. Rug was stained in multiple places and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. The beds were also very noisy. Walls are paper thin, so if you have a noisy neighbor....we brought earplugs. Continental breakfast was included in our rate. Adequate breakfast, skip the coffee and go for the tea. Waitstaff was mixed, not overly friendly, but good enough. Eating area, lobby, etc were very clean. Local papers provided in the lobby along with a lot of tour papers, and sightseeing booklets. Front desk staff was great. Coffee/tea maker is room was nice. They provide you with little packets of tea, coffee, sugar, etc. Skip the coffee here too. Pub at the end of the street was loud and rude people. Waitstaff very unfriendly. Lots of other places to go for food."
130,545,"Mar 19 2004	I've stayed her 5 times I like it	I have stayed here 5 times in the past 3 years and I like the hotel staff is nice, breakfast is pretty good, but that isnt the most important thing to me, but the coffee is terrible, we usually walk down the street to Coffee republic or Costa coffee and get some good coffee. We have stayed in 2 dif kind of rooms, reg double room and family room with 2 double beds and a fold out couch and liked them both. Bathrooms were large for Europe and I love the Earls Court location. I have stayed at 3 other hotels in the area. The Burns, The Oxford and the Rushmore and I like this best. Good Restaurants around here also. Try Dinos right next to tube on Earls Ct RD."
