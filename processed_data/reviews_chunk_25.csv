363,470,"Jan 16 2007 	No problem with the Tropicana	I just returned from a week's stay at the Tropicana. I went there to attend the Consumer Electronics Show. That show was expected to draw almost 150,000 people. Needless to say, the town was nearly sold out and room prices reflected it. After reading a number of reviews on this site, I decided to stay in the Paradise Tower portion of the resort.. Most of the complaints about rooms tended to come from those who stayed in the Garden Area of the hotel. These are the cheapest rooms (by about $30) and also the oldest, as they are part of the original resort. Their room rates were quite modest by comparison to most other hotels.The room I was given was a bit dated but was surprisingly large, clean, well supplied and everything was in working order including ample hot water. The room was quiet, bed comfortable and the ventilation system worked just great. I was on the 16th floor and had a great view of the Strip. Check in was efficient and the staff was pleasant. I never experienced problems with staff anywhere in the hotel. In fact, I and my business partner had a number of meals at the Garden Cafe and the waitress we had for breakfast each day always seemd to find some way to tease and joke with us. I had read on this site that the Tropicana was going to close after Jan. 1, '07 and be torn completely down and something else put up in its place. I thought that would be a shame, as I've always found the Trop. to be a good value for the money charged and a pleasant place to stay.I talked to several staff while I was there and it seems that the above description was the original plan. However, the original development company has sold out to another development comnay and the current plans call for them to tear down the original, 3 story (Garden Area) section of the hotel while keeping the exiasting towers and casino in operation. They will then build three new towers and, when they finish, the Tropicana will be a 10,000 room hotel, the largest hotel in Vegas! It is likely that the hotel portion will be operated by Marriott or Westin and those two chains are the ones that the new development company works with most often.So, for those who found the Tropicana to be such a terrible experience - give it a few years and try again. You may find a whole new Tropicana to like!!"
1,477,Nov 24 2009	not that bad what do you expect for the price	lot of parking and the people that works their very pleasant I brought my little dog (yorkie) and the manager made it very comfotable for me and my group. and we are planning to stay again next year if they except my dog again
2,477,"Nov 19 2009 	Worst Hotel Ever	I go to Las Vegas atleast twice a month for business. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I did not feel safe. Someone was playing really loud music from their car in the parking lot so they could hear it in there hotel room. I was woken up very early in the morning by loud trucks. It is right next to a truck stop. I called the manager to cancel my second night stay because I booked online and pre-paid the would not credit me my second night. Also the charge a $5 service fee per night, for who knows what there was no service ever provided. My room was never cleaned on the second day and I left. Do not stay here EVER!"
3,477,Nov 7 2009 	It served its purpose-somewhat!	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights while on business in Vegas. The price was good. We paid $29 a night so I wasnt expecting much. I cant say much about the service as we really didnt receive any. The people at the check in were friendly enough but I got the impression they wouldnt try to help with anything more than checking you in and out. When we first arrived I wasnt impressed. I considered finding another place to stay. When we got to the room I was pleasantly suprised. While the room was dated it was clean and a good size. I always do a check of the room when I first arrived and the sheets were obviously clean. The location was convient for us. It was a short distance from the strip (about 5min drive. maybe a 20-30min walk.) It was right by the freeway entrance which worked for us. The room doors are outside and ours (803) had a gap around the door. (not enough so people could see in but enough to let light and sound in). Its not the nicest hotel but it served our purpose.
4,477,Oct 27 2009 	Great value and location	Rooms were large and clean with a great shower and towels and some toiletries provided. Location is a ten minute walk to MGM and New York New York. If walking from the strip make sure you stay on the Excalibur side of the road.
5,477,"Oct 11 2009 	probably one of the cheapest hotels in vegas but still good	the room was only 30 dollars per night or something like it, probably because it is kind of far from the strip, but still the rooms are clean and the restaurant is ok."
6,477,"Oct 10 2009 	Great Price 	I travelled as a last minute trip to Vegas and stumbled across this hotel online. i was somewhat weary having read the reviews on this site and also as the price was less than 20 per night, but all the same figured I'd give it a bash for a two night stay.First of all, without any disrespect to any previous reviews, but if you are paying such a low fee, how can you expect The Ritz??? I took a cab to this hotel from McCarren International Airport, and it cost me $17 door to door. I was amazed on arrival at how close this hotel is to everything. It looks out directly onto the Excalibur Hotel and the new York New York hotel with its rollercoaster. The South end of the Strip where many attractions are is literally a 5 minute walk across the car park. Fabulous Location!!!!The staff on reception were most welcoming and most helpful on my arrival, and advised me immediately of the $5.50 service fee required to be paid on check out, so no hidden surprises. I had to leave a $50 deposit using my card, refundable (less the service fee) on checkout, or if you have no card its $100 cash - still refundable minus the service fee.I was given my key and found my room. Expecting the worst, I opened the door and was thrilled that I trusted my judgement to book this accommodation. Yes, its basic, and by that I mean no Ironing Board, No tea and coffee facilities, No Wifi - but it was Very Clean and very very comfortable, Completely air conditioned, and well maintained. Huge big colour TV, Nice clean en suite bathroom and telephone to make and receive calls. The room locked from the inside, both with the door lock and key chain and was very secure.The pool is clean and pleasant, as is the jacuzzi and open very late, though I didnt get chance to use the jacuzzi.I had no problems leaving my belongings in my room whilst going out, though I did hide my money, as I do in any hotel that I stay in. I had two great nights sleep here in the HUGE clean comfortable bed, and was bid a very sincere good bye by the staff on checking out. Previous reviews state that hookers were near by in the area??? I cant comment as I never saw any, (though you only have to walk down the strip to be hounded by men and women trying to give you free porn and call girl cards) and the area in which the hotel is situated in didn't appear dodgy at all.If its luxury you want, go across the street and stay at the Excalibur and pay a couple of hundred dollars a night, otherwise this place is simply ideal for couples, singles or families.Also, its convieniently located for gay travellers in the area, being close to several of Las Vegas' gay clubs and bars.A fantastic, cheap way of spending some time in Vegas and enjoying ALL it has to offer at a very low price. Would 110% stay here again."
7,477,"Oct 2 2009 	A hotel that budget travellers hotel with a car will love	This hotel is one of those &quot;adaquate if you just need a bed to sleep in&quot;. And thats just what we booked it for. Nothing special was expected and thats exactly what we got. Hotel has ample parking and seems to be a trucker haunt with big rigs across the street. We avoided just about everything else in this hotel from is casino and pool to it's restaurant (Denny's). If we wanted to go the strip we just parked our car in a strip casino's self park.Stayed for 2 nights and both nights either had noisy neighbours next or above us. The Hotel staff left the garbage carts outside our room in 100 degree weather which gave our room a nasty smell, and we found empty soda cans under our bed the first night that we didnt drink so they werent found when the room was cleaned.Booked via Priceline for next to nothing and was charged a $5,00 resort fee, which every hotel in Vegas seems to do cause the Luxor charged me $15,00 and the PH charged me $19,00 for the priviledge of staying there."
8,477,"Jun 28 2009 	wild wild dump	firstly the room was terrible, the bedding could have crawled off the bed, it made u itchy all night, also every night i would share my room with insects. the bath towels where stained and on one occassion we had 2 use them twice for showers the next day cause of no housekeeping that day. very poor housekeeping when u did get your room cleaned, no clean bedding, no clean bath or toilet paper. but they still charged you a hidden extra $5 every day for that service. the pool was surrouned by sleazy men all wanting 2 watch over u and that was even with my husband there. the pool loungers and tables where so dirty they had seen better days. the best thing i will be doing is never ever going back."
9,477,"Jun 26 2009 	The worse hotel I have ever stayed in	We stayed at this hotel in May. It was filthy, there was dirt smeared in the shower. The decor is right out of the 70's. The hot tub was broken the whole time we were there. The only thing I can reccommend is the restaurant, that had great food. Look else where for chain hotels, it's cheap but the hotel is really bad."
10,477,Jun 23 2009 	NIce place to stay In	Not very far from the South end of the Strip.Staff of Casino &amp; Bar is very helpful.Quiet place and very comfortable room.Best place to be in with limited budget.
11,477,"Jun 20 2009 	$5 extra per day service fee SCAM	Booked the room online and when I checked in they tacked on an extra $5 per day resort/hotel fee. If I would have known that I would have booked elsewhere.There is NO coffee maker or clock radio in the room, so if you want coffee you need to go buy it. There is a Denny's and they do everything they can to get you in there.If you like drugs, pimps, and hookers this is the place for you!!The bartender on Sat/Sun was SMOKING HOT (10 face and DD hooters hanging out)!!! Oh yeah, the weekday newspaper hanging on the door was nice."
12,477,"Jun 1 2009 	Good Price a seedy part of town.	I was traveling for a family emergency so I took the cheapest package I could find. It wasn't too rough a section of town but I was propositioned by prostitutes and I could see drug dealers walking through the Trucker's parking lot. I wouldn't stay there with the family because for a little more you can stay at a better place. It was expedient and inexpensive. If all you need is a cheap bed, this place will do. The on site restaurant is also very inexpensive."
13,477,Mar 26 2009 	Wild Wild Mess	This motel for the area that its in.Is some garbage. I wouldn't want my WORST ENEMY to stay here.Only thing was okay is to escape the room and go to the casino.I was very afraid of sleeping on the beds and the feeling of the motel reminds me of the movie vacancy.If all the hotels and motels were booked in vegas and this is the only choice I would stay in the streets all night.HMPH i will never again!!!!!!!
14,477,"Mar 25 2009 	Clean rooms--but very noisy	The rooms were clean. About average price for the low end motels. Casino very smokey. The rooms have virtually no sound barrier from other rooms or the outdoors. We heard stools flushing, showers running, alarm clocks going off, footsteps from above, &quot;extra&quot; bedroom activities, television shows, fights and arguments. My husband is deaf in one ear so he could just roll over--me I bought ear plugs, that helped! I would not stay here again. No high speed internet--free dial up for 30 min. at one time. Did not get soap or shampoo replaced the 4 days there without having to ask--then one time never did get it!"
15,477,"Mar 17 2009 	Hotel was ok service was not.	Spent 3 nights in June, everything was ok about the hotel until I checked out, I was charged 60 dollars for 3 movies I didn't see, tried to contact the manager but wasn't able to speak to him, because of that reason I will never go back to this hotel..."
16,477,Jan 27 2009 	great place to stay	I stayed here for three mounths in 2008 and you will not find a better place yor the money.
17,477,"Jan 17 2009 	This place is a [-] DUMP!	First off we'll start small: The tv was was a piece of crap and the picture it got was even worse. Good thing for me that audio/video is my everyday business, so I was able to fix it a little bit. Next, the electrical outlet at the sink where the hair dryer is was totally FRIED out! I unplugged the dryer and refused to use the plug. The front door did two things when you open it: 1. EVERYONE in the whole building would hear when you went in or out. 2. The whole front wall would SHAKE when the door opened or closed. All someone would have to do is take a run at that wall and I really think it would fall right down! THERE is no elevator and for someone with bad knees that is just plain TORTURE! The stairs are the NARROWEST on EARTH! Two people going in different directions would not be able to pass, one would have to back up. The other people in the hotel, which it is NOT, it is a MOTEL that has a casino, were probably doing things they should not have been doing. I know there was someone there in the time I was there that had a GUN in their room. Walking to the Strip can be a pain because of the bridge over the freeway. I was considering saying I want my money back!"
18,477,"Jan 9 2009 	We thought it was fine. Lucked out?	My girlfriend and I found the Wild wild west a fine place to stay. Worried about the terrible reviews it was close to the strip and we got it for $25 online. I didn't like the added phone charge of 4.95 even after I told them I had no desire to use the phone. While I was booking the room my girlfriend was in the car and a hotel security guard acted weird to her asking if she was staying here. The gambling hall was smoke filled and filled with ugly, middle aged people. Only one decent looking waitress. We didn't gamble. We weren't able to park close to our room and the neighborhood didn't seem the best. Inside the room was clean and didn't stink. Painted and ceiling was fine. Pillows were small but we were glad it wasn't like the description in peoples reviews. Shower was nice and we slept without any loud outside noise. In the morning had no problem with any people while we were leaving. All in all we will probably stay there again if the price is right. I can understand people who spent $100 are not pleased. For $25 we stayed a night longer than planned."
19,477,"Dec 20 2008 	bills stay	The rooms were great, the staff was very polite, helpful. Ladies watch the elevator. It is right off the street where the taxis park and there were un-desirables hanging around there. My daughter was confronted when approaching the elevators and she was scared to death. Not something that should happen in a Vegas Casino. She failed to call authorities but did''t know any better. That casino really needs to beef up security at that door."
20,477,"Jul 21 2008 	Gives new meaning to the phrase ""no frills""	Stayed at the WWW for Super Bowl weekend. Made our travel plans at the last minute and the WWW was the cheapest place we could find reasonably close to The Strip - well...you get what you pay for.Got a good idea what we were in store for when we pulled in around midnight and saw several shady looking characters in the parking lot smoking what I'm guessing was an illegal substance of one kind or another. The WWW seems to cater to a decidedly low brow element - a lot of the people we encountered there looked like transients.As for our stay, it was a total disaster. First off, we entered our room and noticed it had a very musty odor and wasn't very clean. In addition, it lacked even the most basic amenities that one typically finds at even the cheapest motels (no phone book, no pen and paper, not even a Bible (I'm guessing the Gideon people are afraid to go there). Not only that but the lock on our door didn't work right (you had to slam it several times to get it to lock). Not only that but they put the room # right on the key so if you happen to lose it anyone who finds it will know exactly which room to rob.Service at the WWW was sub par as well. We requested a phone book and was told by the surly woman at the desk that the desk copy was the only one they had. Also, repeated requests for extra towels were ignored (housekeepers left us two small towels every morning for two guests). Imagine our surprise when we checked out and saw that our bill included a $4/day &quot;amenities fee&quot;. Amenities? What amenities?WWW is a disaster - avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for a cheap place to stay, spend a few extra bucks and stay a the Imperial Palace or go offstrip to Arizona Charlie's or Sam's Town."
21,477,"Jul 20 2008 	clever photos made this place look GREAT	I booked this for NBA All-Star weekend 2007. The photos were great as were the rates.....or so I thought. When we got to the hotel, I felt as if I had stepped back in time into the wild wild west. There was a surcharge to even use the phone, so needless to say as soon as my friend and I saw the room, the area it was located in and the questionable characters looming outside, we immediately pulled out our cell phones to try to find another place to stay. THERE WAS NO PHONE BOOK in the room to assist us. They even still had the old &quot;punch key&quot; type room keys. Well, once we booked another room ON THE STRIP, last minute, during All-Star weekend, we found it was worth the extra expense to be safe and feel secure. While calling other hotels and speaking with other local residents, many of them said they were shocked the place was still open and thought it had been torn down!! We went by the gift shop to buy some bottled water, the employees were telling off-color jokes and asked my friend and I why we were in town. When we told them, the response was &quot;And why are you staying HERE??&quot;............Well, they have a 24-hour cancellation policy, so they got our money with no guests inside the room. My friend and I didn't even use the bathroom in there! While we were waiting on our cab to take us to the strip, we sat in the cafe' which was located in ANOTHER BUILDING of the motel..........we grabbed a bite to eat there, food was ok and really cheap. I guess it had to have some redeeming qualities, huh?"
22,477,"Jul 5 2008 	They don't call it the Wild Wild West for nothing!	My son and I went with another family that had booked this place through Hotels.com, so we didn't have a choice in the place. We were very concerned when we pulled into the place and police cars were there arresting someone, and the security guards and employees were also milling around outside. There were also obvious shady dealings going on around us, as prostitutes were around and even approached one of our young men. The first night we were there, the person in the next room was arrested by the police! Then the next day after our rooms were cleaned we found an open condom wrapper on the desk in the room! We complained to the front desk and they took $20 off the room for the night and changed the sheets. Then when checking out, we had missing items that we needed help from housekeeping and the front desk and got the runaround for over an hour and finally got our item. We would definitely never stay there again!! The rooms were clean but small, and bare bones. We were on the second floor and only acces was by stairs and overlooked the parking lot."
23,477,"Apr 25 2008 	Like the Plague Avoid this One	I booked on Hotwire. Had I known where I would end up, I never would have booked this one. This place charges fees for everything and anything imaginable in addition to the price quoted by Hotwire. Hotwire shares much of the responsibliity for this disaster! They should require the hotel to disclose their additional hidden charges so that you know what you are buying when you buy. If a hotel charges for things you won't use - or else hit the road, We booked two rooms and were assessed two surcharges for, among other things, parking, you outh to know that going in. Hotwire's policies should change - FAST. We only had one car. Phones were charged for but we have our own cell phones and have no need for it. They unbundle everything and charge for it. It is not a cheap property and not well maintained. The parking lot and entrance were littered with trash. There were employees milling around but they didn't care enough to pick it up.This is a Station Casinos property and is slated to be torn down and replaced by what is slated to be Las Vegas' largest resort complex. It will be a good riddance. I just hope the Ferttita family that runs it will manage it with more of a view toward giving the customer a fair price and good service than that which I have experienced at Palace Station or Wild Wild West. They seem to do better with some of their newer properties.This place should be avoided. There are better deals out there for better places."
24,477,"Apr 17 2008 	RIPPED OFF by them	I booked using Hotwire thinking that HOTWIRE property will be at least reliable and will not be ripped off. I was wrong. When I was out of hotel, some staff came to my room and watched four different movies for which they charged me $75. I am any way going to BBB.com to complain, but this is just to make other people aware of the FRAUD this hotel is."
25,477,"Apr 12 2008 	Riled Mild Rest	Lots of previous reviews make Wild Wild West rooms sound like a horror show. I'm happy to report that my room had no bugs, burns, stains, holes, odors, or electrical fires. There was a sturdy electronic lock on the door. The room itself was smallish and charmless, but given how inexpensive this motel is (especially if you book ahead), that's more an observation than a complaint. (Upon check-in you will have to pay an extra $5.40/night amenities fee. I'd never heard of that, but evidently a big casino/hotel complex a half-mile west does the same ... maybe it's a Vegas thing.) Biggest drawback to this motel is the noise. Walls aren't paper thin, but you'll know when neighbors arrive, depart, watch TV, etc. Worse than that is noise from outside. Because this place is a two-story Southwestern-style motel, immediately outside your room is a courtyard or a parking lot, where people don't bother to keep their voices down. The feeling of remove from other guests is something that I genuinely missed.It's about a half-mile (or less) to the Strip. Unfortunately, the walkway isn't simple to follow, and at night you might want to spring for a cab. I'm glad there's a prominent security presence at the Wild Wild West, but it's a little unsettling that such a presence is judged necessary.Staff was friendly, helpful, and down-to-earth. Rooms don't have alarm clocks. This is a bare-bones place that's physically close to touristy Vegas but feels a world away; it might or might not fit your needs."
26,477,Mar 29 2008 	I liked it	We came here for my birthday looking for something cheap. we stayed 4 or 5 night for under $180 great prices the cafe they have was great. Great Food. We got into town early because we drove. They let us check in early. Just wish it was closer to the strip.
27,477,"Mar 27 2008 	Not a place we would stay at again based on our preferences	We got sent here after our hotel that was booked for roughly two months (Wingate/Wyndham in Henderson, NV) apparently overbooked us and gave us a free night here. Unfortunately, this is not a place we would have chosen to stay. First of all, we chose a non-smoking hotel and this was not non-smoking. Second, we chose queen beds, and we did not have queen beds in our room (these beds were just bigger than a twin size at best). Third, we chose to stay away from the strip/casino atmosphere for a reason (our kids) and this clearly was right near the strip and the casino was right by the check-in desk. Fourth, we chose a hotel with a free continental breakfast and this hotel did not have a free breakfast. It was 2:00 in the morning and we didn't have time to bicker about the place nor time to find somewhere else to go. We were exhausted. I can't complain that it was dirty, because it really was clean in our room. The window did rattle all night because we had the air on which was a nuisance, but other than that, the beds being tiny and the room itself rather tiny, I can't think of any other problems. We were on an upper floor room (access is from the outside only at this hotel) and had stairs to drag our 7 bags up to which didn't make us very happy, as there were no elevators. That said....if you don't care about the above things I listed and you want a cheap place to stay that is fairly close to the strip, this would be fine for you. It also does have an outdoor swimming pool. It wasn't the WWG Hall's fault that we stayed here and that their accomodations were not &quot;apples-to-apples&quot; with what I had originally booked at the other hotel. If you're totally fine with the things I listed, then you'll find that this place is fine for you. I don't like to be mean, but this was not at all what we signed up for; again, based on our preferences only."
28,477,"Mar 19 2008 	Different but cheap!!	Stayed at the Wild Wild West Gambling Hall and Hotel in Las Vegas enroute for the 'USA Road Trip 2008' that I was doing with friends which started at Las Vegas and was to finish back in Las Vegas two weeks later.Booked into the Wild Wild West for two nights over a weekend. Due to our budget we were priced out by the Hotels on the Strip, so this Hotel was a cheap option.I had read a few reviews here on Trip Advisor prior to my vacation and was getting a bit worried prior to arrival. Yes, the Hotel does look a bit shabby and in a bit of a dodgy area, with many unusual characters loitering around the Hotel. But on closer inspection, the Hotel is/or appears safe with plenty of Security personnel making sure these &quot;unusual characters&quot; are moved away from the Hotel.Inside the Hotel, the rooms were a nice size and appeared clean, with a sign outside of the Hotel claiming that the rooms had recently been renovated. Anyway, it was clean and comfortable and I really couldn't fault the rooms.Unfortunately, the rest of the Hotel brings the marks down. As with most City Centre Hotels, it was quite noisy both nights and mornings during my stay, with bangs, sirens and swearing completing a trio of noises.The Hotel is located on W Tropicana Avenue, which if you are planning to walk to the Strip - take note!! You'll have to run the gauntlet of running accross the grass banks or Highways and generally risking your life being hit by a Dodge or Chevvy. Luckily I found a reasonably safe route on my way back from the Strip - email us if you wish me to map the route out for you, or work it out yourself if you're brave enough!!My major gripe with this Hotel was with its Casino, which I found extremely small and smoky. Although the $3 Black Jack and plentyful amount of drinks did take my mind off these for a temporary basis.Overall, for a two night stay in Las Vegas it did the trick to a certain extent. If you want the luxury of Treasure Island or Paris, then pay $$$ to stay there during a weekend, if you want somewhere cheap, stay at the Wild Wild West - it's not that bad!!"
29,477,"Mar 9 2008 	Most reasonably priced on the strip	I stayed at the Wild Wild West for two nights. I spent a lot of time researching for a reasonably price place, and this was it.. It was only about a 15 minute walk to the strip. You have to cross to the other (south) side of the street in order to walk all the way. I didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant in the morning because the line was long and we were in a hurry. The slots and bar were okay. There is NO truckstop next door as I've read in some reviews. The motel just has a large parking lot for truckers to park in. It was a bit loud outside with people talking the first night, but I wore earplugs the next night and didn't hear a thing. The sheets &amp; blankets were nice, the staff was friendly, and the place was clean. Just what I wanted!"
30,477,"Mar 8 2008 	good value for the money!	We arrived after 11pm and were to leave for the Grand Canyon the next morning so we didn't want to invest too much for a few hours sleep. While the property is not new, the room &amp; bathroom were clean and the bed comfortable. We would definitely stay again and had Steak and Eggs for Breakfast for $5.99. We got a decent nights sleep for $30.00."
31,477,"Mar 2 2008 	Cheap... but a NO NO	Stayed here for 2 nights, but would not stay here againThe room we were given had not been made up... not what you want after a 15hrs travel.. The room we did get was clean but it had just been redecoratedStaff not over friendley - went for breakfast... YUKI would call this a truckers Motel nothing moreLots of noise throuhout the night - its a long walk to the stripbetter off paying a bit more on the strip"
32,477,"Jan 27 2008 	Still Laughing.... but will be fair...	Okay... where to start... where to start. Well first off, when I saw the place I was in utter shock... this is probably one of the worst looking hotels I've ever seen. It made me remember a review I had read about the hotel... the guy wrote that he liked that he was able to park his car in front of his room, which made it easy to get away quickly. LOL....which made me think... ONE might need to get away quickly in THIS neighborhood.I booked through hotwire.com for $19.99, then they had the nerve to charge additional $9.99 in booking fees, the hotel charged a laughable resort fee of $5.40!... So, this deal of $19.99 actually cost me about $37.00. (really stupid)Since I had prepaid, I thought... well it is just for the night. The photos the guy from Australia has posted are actually from a while back, because I was told the rooms were all redone in November 2007 and you know what.... this dump wasn't so bad after all. It's old and some of the guest are questionable, but you know what?? The room wasn't bad and I had a view of the strip.This is not the place for the first time visitor to Vegas... trust me... spend some money and stay at a nice strip hotel... staying at a hotel like this would ruin the illusion of Vegas and Vegas is such a awesome city that one should really enjoy it. Now, if you're just passing though and need a place to crash... probably okay.... but not for a vacation or holiday. I wouldn't book my parents in a place like this!!!!, but for me, it was okay for the night.And encase someone from the hotel is looking at this... Yeah, your remodeled room was great... but some thoughts... a little noisy.... if you replaced the windows... a easy CHEAP fix, that alone would help, not to mention maybe some weather stripping under the entry door. I mean some really cheap fixes would really help. Re-Pave the parking lot... I mean some little things could really clean this property up. Again, the room was great... the outside is what is so scary... And lastly... you know how they wrap cars and buses... makes me wonder if one could wrap a building... wouldn't it be cool to wrap this building with a wild wild west western theme??? I read the hotel spent 2 million on the remodel and yes, the room was great... now maybe a million on the outside would really do the trick... it's like real estate... CURB appeal is everything and would probably promote a safer environment."
33,477,"Dec 24 2007 	I try to be fair - but this place was awful	When I found out this was the m-o-t-e-l (not hotel) that my friends had booked for our stay in Vegas, I decided to check it out. Now, I've been accused of being a hotel snob before, and sure I like nice places - but really, as long as it is clean and safe - I'm good!So I checked out a ton of reviews and found that most said the room was just that - clean, not fancy, but a decent place to lay your head down at night. Not to mention the motel boasts of it's &quot;newly renovated rooms!&quot; ... I wish I had known their definition of newly renovated ahead of time. First - I think? the carpet might have been new. But that's about it. The furniture and decor was ... cheesy at best, and well worn to boot - nothing new about it. The lock on the door looked like it had been busted through before. The bathroom was disgusting - cigg burns on the bathtub, by the time your shower was done you were up to your knees in water (draining issues?), the walls were stained with God knows what, and the little rubber strip/molding around the floor had been screwed back into the wall. Second - our first night there, the cops were searching for someone... sneaking around, going room to room... yes... bodes well for that &quot;safe&quot; feeling. Some of the other people we were with also had a room there... the air conditioner leaked water all over the side of one of the beds. We had to call multiple times to get an iron, to get extra towels, etc. The little restaurant thing - the staff was rude, there were only about 5 tables occupied when we went there, all the other tables were un-bussed, and they got all huffy with us when we asked for a table for 7 - and then took their sweet time arranging the tables for us. Honestly - not worth the couple of bucks you might save staying here over somewhere else. If you love dirty, grungy motels with staff who obviously hate their jobs... go right ahead! As for me... I will never stay here again. I tried to keep the attitude of &quot;I'll still have fun, it's Vegas!&quot; but seriously... the room put a huge damper on the trip."
34,477,"Nov 24 2007 	What a Shock!	I stayed at this hotel on my last Las Vegas trip and vowed never to stay here again. The best thing about it was the casino and its closeness to the strip. However, the room was horrible! Not only was the shower dirty and the room smelled like no one had stayed there in ages, there was barely any room to walk. My son and I (who was 2 at the time) got the shock of our lives. We were watching t.v. and suddenly the socket started to pop! Luckily, since the room was so small it didn't take much time for me to grab him and make a dash for the door. When I went to the front desk and explained the situation, the staff tried to imply my son was responsible for the electrical outburst. I was outraged! My son wasn't even tall enough to reach the darn thing. Plus, the socket was behind the t.v. which was situated on top of a long dresser. (Pretty classy, huh?) If you plan to stay here stay at your own risk. Either way I hope your not as shocked as I was."
35,477,"Nov 15 2007 	Not as close as youd hope	This is a MOTEL not a hotel. There is no sidewalk to the strip, so you must call for a cab, or drive. The rooms were recently updated, and it shows. They were very clean, and odor free. Experienced no problemns with the guests or staff. There is security guards on duty, but I only saw them sitting in the same place all the time, never saw them making roiunds.The casino is very small, mostly just slots, one table of black jack and one table for craps and roulette. The waitresses were nice but slow to ask if you neede a drink, i was there one time for 30 minutes before i was asked.Attatched restaurant had good for at very affordable prices.they advertise on there signs that it is &quot;the best&quot; locals casino. And pretty much that apperars to be all that gambles there.This place is not so cheap, for what you get, but it wasnt as bad as anticipated. Nonethe less, i will NEVER stay there again."
36,477,"Oct 8 2007	Enjoyed the casino	We did not stay at the Wild Wild West but we did spend some time in the casino. The roulette dealers (Mark and John) were friendly and easy-going. We played with $.25 chips, $2 min bet which was the cheapest roulette we found during our week stay. We had alot of fun and we won!"
37,477,"Sep 29 2007 	Oh My God!!!!!!!	We just got back from vaction today after visiting las vegas and staying at this dump!!!!!!!!! We thought that it would be at least okay for the price, but boy were we WRONG!!!!! This place is an absolute joke. First of all it's a lot further from the strip than they say! you cant even walk if you wanted to because there is an overpass that doesn't allow you to walk, so you have to call a cab or take the bus. Me and my husband went there for a friends wedding for 5 days, and felt like we were held captive in our room at night due to the massive amounts of drug deals, prostitusion, and staglers if you will roaming about the street and hotel lobby! The staff at the hotel wasn't all that friendly either! We also stayed in a remodled room which smelled like severe body odor when we opened the door. We tried to cover it up, but nothing would help. There also is a lot of noise due to the constuction of the &quot; remodled rooms&quot; and the truck stop directley across the street! Personally i would have rather stayed in a motel 8, or stayed a few less days in order to get a better place to stay!"
38,477,"Sep 11 2007 	This Hotel is fine to stay at...	There is nothing wrong with this hotel...they just renovated half the hotel so you might luck out and be able to get a newly revamped room.The casino is small, but the excalibur and luxor are right down the street if you want a larger one. I have no complaints about this hotel except the lack of liqour at the bar. They only have a few brands of each kind of liqour. Good luck getting some grey goose!! lol.In the end, its cheap and not too far from the strip. Ive stayed here 3 times."
39,477,"Aug 28 2007 	No frills but no major problems...Vegas on a budget	This hotel is definitely not up there with the likes of the Bellagio and other casino-hotels in Vegas, but if what you're after is somewhere clean, reasonably priced and with easy access to the strip and the main Vegas attractions then the Wild Wild West is as good as any. It may not be glamorous - and for the next few weeks or so I believe their grill (which usually boasts a $1.49 breakfast) is out of action - but it has a pool and plenty of parking, surrounded by several fast food outlets and garages. Its on-site casino is small but the drinks are cheap and the staff very friendly.We got a good deal on the price using a travel coupon booklet found in a Denny's along the way and got two rooms at around $50 each a night, booked on the same day, so it's definitely rooms on a budget - ideal for young travellers, as my group was."
40,477,"Jul 24 2007 	Little friends awaiting your arrival between the sheets!!!	I stayed with a friend out of a last resort situation. We had exteded our stay and had one night in between our hotel reservations on a Saturday night. It was the only place with a room availalbe. We arrived at the motel and had strange men peering at us behind garbage cans as we went to our room. The tv was broken. Once it was fixed we used a plastic bag to cover the remote because it was very gross. This bag also came in handy when we used the phone which was covered in ear wax. The bathroom was like a gas station latrine and had several cigarette burns on the toilet and tub. We were afraid and did not sit ont he toilet seat but instead chose to hover. There was a big ugly stain on the curtain. The sheets looked clean and the beds were comfortable enought. Our dead bolt was broken so we were afraid and slept with the tv on, but we really could not sleep because we were itchy all night. We could feel little friends crawling on us once we turned out the lights. It was very creepy. The next morning we got up very early, dressed, skipped the putrid shower and jumped into a cab and said see ya later. We felt like we were being excreted from the very bowels of hell and then once we arrived at New York New York it was like we had fallen into the clouds of heaven. Our room was beautiful and the shower was exhilarating. We will NEVER stay at the Wild Wild West again. We would rather sleep in a pup tent under a palm tree."
41,477,"Mar 27 2007 	not a nice place to stay	I stayed at the wild wild westcasino hotel, and my Stay was very unpleasant sheets had hair  I had called to get clean sheets i was scared to sleep on them the toilet had pubic hair on it."
42,477,Mar 13 2007 	Worst Hotels I've Every Stayed In	The $150 per night we paid you would expect alot more than what we got. The bathroom was so scary that my friend and I took showers with our socks on. The plumbing in the room had a fowl smell. Bed was hard and we both woke up itching all over. On top of it all we had to pay an additional $4 per night fee. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
43,477,"Feb 2 2007	robbed and ripped off	My assistant and I booked a two night stay at the Wild West Gambling Hall at the end of January, 2007. We picked the hotel because of price and location. We arrived at the hotel and went inside and registered. We then went to room, and my assistant decided to move our vehicle to the front of our motel style room. He was asked three times while on way to the car if he had any drugs to sell by individuals loitering on the premises. The room was rundown and in need of attention. ie; dozens of burn marks from cigarettes on the furniture and bathroom fixtures, at least 20 on tub alone. We then went to bed, and were awakened at about 11:30 PM by our car's horn beeping once, as it does when you use the remote device to lock the car. We went out to the car and discovered that it had been entered, evidently by a remote control device, and robbed. The windows were not broken and there was no evidence it had been forcibly entered. We lost approximately $500.00 in personal effects. I immediately called security. It took approximately 20 minutes for him to arrive. He said he was busy and would return in a few minutes to take a report. We never saw him again! I called the front desk and informed them that we would not be staying the next night because of security concerns. We took our bags with us the next morning and went to the project on which we were working. We came back later that afternoon and talked to the gentleman at the front desk. He asked if we were the people that owned the U-haul trailer that had been broken ito. We said no, our vehicle was a Chrysler. Evidently, another vehicle was robbed the same night. He showed no concern for us or our experience, offered no help and refused to refund our money for that nights stay. All in all, it was a terrible experience, and I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone, regardless of price and location."
44,477,"Jan 7 2007 	Awesome Experience	I read reviews of this motel before I went down and expected a crack den or to maybe see a production of the show cops. I was pleasently surprized to get the exact opposite. The rooms serve their purpose, there isn't people bothering you for money. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant is good and cheap. It isn't a five star hotel with room service and valet parking. If you are not picky and just need a place to sleep and shower, the Wild Wild West is the perfect place. Plus the bartenders maybe some of the hottest girls in Vegas."
45,477,"Dec 5 2006 	Avoid  this place is a dump	Added a few days onto a business trip and wanted to do it on the cheap so I decided to give this place a try. I have never been motivated to write a review about a hotel (this place is actually a motel) before but there was so much wrong with this place. It began at registration. The clerk was on a personal call and after about two minutes acted like she was doing me a favor by checking me in. No &quot;hi can I help you&quot; or &quot;thank you, enjoy your stay&quot; or anything. The room appeared relatively clean except for the ants in the bathroom. The room was small and run-down. I have seen better quality furniture on the side of the road. The door was cheap and the locks did not give me any comfort given the quality of the clientele. There is a lot of noise from surrounding rooms and the parking lot. To turn on and off the light by the bed, I had to unscrew the light bulb. On day two, housekeeping forgot to make the room. At check-out, I received the same indifferent service from another clerk which makes me believe &quot;guest service&quot; is a foreign concept. Bottom line, I would never stay at this motel ever again. It was cheap, but for the quality of this dump I'm sure you could find something better for equal price. The last insult was a $4.00 per night amenity fee that was added to the bill. I guess the ants were considered an amenity."
46,477,"Sep 29 2006 	this motel made me want to leave vegas	We had a coupon for $25.00 which we were vacationing all over and were trying to be cheap with where we slept. This place had a flashy billboard advertising the $25.00 and a phone #, which I called first to see if they had a reservation. I was told a room was available but since it was a friday- the cheapest they could give me was $99.00. Once there in the office, the man said the cheapest was 110.00 and that didn't count the fees. He said that was as low as he could go even though we had a coupon and military discount. I didn't expect much considering this was a $25.00 place but we didn't pay that by far. I was afraid to sleep and people were hanging around in the parking lot being noisy. I left vegas with memories of feeling ripped off and I would have rather slept in the car. I would have been okay paying $25.00 since we were in vegas but not a penny more."
47,477,"Aug 10 2006	Excellent for those on a budget	Had absolutely no problem at all with this motel, it was close enough to the strip to walk, was clean and everything worked. The price was very nice and for those people complaining surely you knew what you were getting for the price? I was on a budget and just really wanted a place to lay my head after a hard night's partying.I agree it's not the kind of place I would take a loved one, or if I wanted to hang around the hotel (no point going on holiday though if you are going to do this). The pool is crap but I just went to the one at Luxor everyday.Well done Wild Wild West"
48,477,"Aug 8 2006 	Cheap but worth the savings?	Just got back from our stay at the Wild Wild West. Never one for spending too much money on a hotel room, let alone one in Vegas, my husband booked the hotel through Expedia. We paid $25.00 per night. On arrival, check in took a few minutes. The only front desk clerk was talking on the phone, calming an irate customer about the resort fee. I had already read this on the site, and knew about the $4.00 per day fee. Resort is pushing it. It is a motel, with outdoor access to your room. The hotel caters to the truckers and locals, so you know that there are some bargains to be had. The Gamblers Grill Restaurant is open 24 hrs per day, and has some really good prices. $1.99 for 2 eggs, bacon/sausage, hash browns and toast (available 11pm-11am), and the  lb burger at $2.69 was actually filling. Service during our stay was mixed. On the map, it looks as if this property is a mere block or two from the strip. Dont be fooled. It took 15-20 minutes to walk the distance. Not much, but in the heat, it feels a LOT longer. We did gamble at the little casino, and the staff working there were very nice. The waitresses were always around, and we even got a lesson in how to lose your money playing craps!! The room itself was just that, a room. The air conditioner worked. The shower head looked like it would come right off when the water was turned on, but managed to stay put through out our stay. The bathtub looked like it had been cleaned so many times with bleach, the plastic was starting to peel, and crumble off, and the plug for the drain on the bath tub did not work. We did ask for a rubber plug to be brought to our room, but gave up after waiting 48 hrs. BTW, it never did show up during our stay. One of the dual lights located over the king size bed had a missing light bulb, and lamp shade, and was in theory a bare, open socket. A little on the dangerous side! Even with all this, we were only looking for a room to rest our heads, and a pool to jump into on occasion. This place had both. The major irritant of our stay was to learn that they had no holding area for your bags after check out (12pm). Our flight did not leave until later that evening, and although the advertised rate outside on the bill board is $19.99 per night, and the Expedia rate not that much more, we were charged $45.99 for the convenience of our hotel room holding our bag until 6 pm. Cabs from the location ran from $20.00 to and from the airport, and $16-20 to Freemont St. You are better off to take the 201 bus (stops right outside) down the block to the strip and transfer to the Deuce (bus). A 24 hour pass costs you $5.00. If you like a bargain, or are on a very limited budget, the hotel/motel is for you! Other then that, look for another hotel to stay in, but DO check out the little casino on the property, and dont miss the Gamblers Grill!"
49,477,"Aug 8 2006 	hurt so good	Not that us 4 women had a whole lot of choices given all the events going on during this weekend without spending $500 a night wild wild west was not that bad for only $89. We were at the back of the property which was a little disturbing and we are fairly certain we saw more than a few &quot;working girls&quot; but the bathroom was mostly clean and the beds gave us a place to sleep for the night. The pool was wanderful newly remodeled including a fairly large hot tub and the girls serving drinks checked on us often for refills. We played a little in the casino and it was ok a little dank as expected. In the end I have to say that if your looking for a 5 star room your dreaming, but if your looking for a place to sleep cheap and lay out by the pool all day within walking distence of the strip this is your best shot."
50,477,"Jun 26 2006	The front dest employee was abrasive-charges in error	The staff at the front desk were not helpful, somewhat rude. Our credit card was billed incorrectly and we still cannot get the hotel to take an interest in correcting it. They do not return calls-the room was moderate."
51,477,"May 31 2006	I was scared!!!!!!!!!!!! Couldn't sleep afraid car would be stolen.	I go to Vegas probably every 3-mnths, so making a pitstop there I thought I would just stay economically. I was REALLY scared staying here. The person at the front desk was not friendly &amp; they had just kicked a prostitute out?!?! I didn't sleep, I was too afraid of my car being stolen. There was a fight across the street between 2 groups of people. The bathroom was dirty (toilet had cigarette burns...) Didn't go to casino, due to the people inhabiting. Couldn't wait to get out of there, was not worth the money I saved!!!! SCARED!!!!"
52,477,"May 10 2006	How Desperate Are You?	Okay folks, friends of ours from Italy planned this trip knowing nothing about Vegas. We wrongly assumed they had booked a hotel for us and we got stuck staying hear. It was pretty ghetto and to make things worse we were held up in the parking lot! There is no security there and it is next to a commercial/trucking area so there are lots of places to hide. I do agree that the gamblers grill is a deal especially if you don't have much to spend. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL! The Excalibur is just down the street and not that expensive, trust me your life is worth it!"
53,477,"Apr 14 2006	In the running for worst motel in the world	There is one positive about the Wild Wild West: their restaurant, the Gambler's Grill. It's extremely cheap and its burgers and breakfast fare are really good. The only hassle is that you have to go through the dingy gambling hall to get to it.The motel itself is simply nasty: Noisy airconditioners, the stench of stale smoke, stained sheets, blankets full of holes. Given that you can stay on the Strip for as little as 2-3 bucks more, it's really atrocious value and just plain vile."
54,477,"Apr 10 2006	Never again	Not enough the bathroom was dirty, the sink was cracked, toilet seat stained, the shower valve didn't turn (luckily my husband had a screw driver so he fixed it) the beds were uncomfortable and that large big rig trucks pull in and out at all times of the night and if you are in a lower unit you can hear every move the people upstairs make, no we also got to hear the police make an arrest at 2:30am. It felt like we were hearing an episode of &quot;Cops&quot; Needless to say we checked out early."
55,477,"Apr 10 2006	Very Economical	Good place to stay at if you don't want to spend a lot of money on your hotel room. We were just in Vegas to see Dane Cook. Since it's prime time there right now all the hotel prices were really high. We couldn't see paying $300.00 or more a night just for a place to sleep and shower. So, it was perfect for us. The room was clean and the water pressure in the showers was really good. The burgers at the Gambler's Grill were cheap and awesome. And, we didn't have to wait a long time at all for four burgers and fries. We sat by the nice clean pool area and enjoyed our burgers. We would stay at again."
56,477,"Mar 28 2006	Not what I paided for.	While the food quality and price in the restaurant are GREAT, the service is slow and some of the servers and hostess need to be friendlier. The actual hotel needs lots of improvements in general maintenance and customer service for the Las Vegas traveler. (Unless we just got the worst room they had.) The exterior boast low rates, unknown to us until we arrived (I'd pay that rate for a return visit not much more.) We also didn't know it was NASCAR weekend in Vegas one of the reasons we had problems finding better priced quality. They advertise high speed internet but there are not enough connections for every room we took our 8lb laptop for nothing. Our room was only cleaned once during our visit including linen, but they failed to ever clean the toilet, and shower (the entire bathroom,) before or during our stay. The floor the baseboards the restroom in general was pretty messed up. The restroom light keep shorting out as it is connected to the restroom fan. I reported it twice, was serviced twice but didn't stay fixed. One of our keys was not the right key (although, we noticed too late to correct it) I did report it at check out time, but the rep. didn't seem too interested. Considering this is Vegas they should be more accommodating and offer to hold patron luggage (or at least tell you on the website or advertising that they dont provide the service.) Check out is at 12 noon and our flight time was 7pm. We had to go elsewhere for luggage storage."
57,477,"Jan 24 2006	a good deal for the money	stayed there in mid janurary. had a problem with the toilet first night, but they gave me another room as soon as i asked. please staff, good housekeeping people, close to strip, and close to orleans casino, and about a 25 minute walk to rio and plams. i enjoyed it very much. you have to remember that its not 5 stars, but they do not charge 5 star rates either. clean rooms. if your not going to be in your room much and be out on the town, it is a great way to save some $$$$$$$$$$."
58,477,Dec 27 2005	A great place to bake a potato on your car engine	This is a great place to stay if you have high hopes of seeing the police arrest someone in your hotel parking lot.
59,477,"Aug 23 2005	Enjoyed this Hotel	My first time ever on holiday and I decided to go to Vegas and to stay at the cheapest Hotel I could find, but I wasn't disapointed with the Wild Wild West. I read all of the reviews in Tripadvisor and got really worried that I may have made a mistake by booking this Hotel. But boy did some of you people make a big mistake by not seeing this Hotel for what it was. It was clean and safe and it had some of the cheapest and best food around.I will be back again next year."
60,477,"Jul 26 2005	Can't wait to go back!!!	I was really surprised by this hotel, after reading the terrible reviews. I went to this hotel expecting the worst and got the best. The rooms were nice with comfy beds. The staff was great. They were fun to talk to. The restaurant had great food. The casino had character, I was able to meet some of the locals. The only downfall to this visit was they were still remodling the pool. It looked great to me, but it wasn't open yet. So I can't wait to go back to see the friendly staff, great locals, and take a dip in the pool."
61,477,"Jun 9 2005	Good place to stay for the money	The Wild Wild West is not as bad as everyone says it is. The rooms are small, but they are clean, and things were pretty quiet. For only $20.00, you can't expect too much. The slots in the casino were loose, and drink service was good. The food was awesome, especially the 1/2 pound burger and fries. If you just want a cheap place to stay, this is it. If you are looking for a fancy place, stay elsewhere."
62,477,"May 17 2005 	Not bad.	I got a great price on my room here. There was a $50 deposit upon check-in even though the room was paid for in advance, which annoyed me a little bit, but I experienced no problems recovering my deposit.  I wrote a 12 page paper in this room, and was pretty comfortable. The room was clean and pretty quiet for a room with an outside entrance. It was free of bugs and unpleasant smells (oddly enough, a problem I have run into at even upscale Vegas resorts) and well-stocked. The air conditioner was awesome; I kept the room freezing the whole time I was there. The staff were all very friendly. The morning checkout girl was cute. The maid service does tend to completely ignore &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; signs, though. The 24 hour Gambler's Grill serves really impressive food for a great price (like 1.99+ for a big burger and fries), but service there is VERY SLOW because they are understaffed. Expect to wait a long time for your good, cheap food. The clientele are a little shady-looking, but I kept the room's deadbolt locked, and nothing came of their shadiness.It's walking distance to New York, New York, if you can find a walkway. I just went to NY, NY's cab station and took a cab back to the hotel. It cost me $5 for the ride. The cab driver was nuts.Altogether, if you don't have a car, I'd probably stay somewhere on the strip for a little more money; the costs that I incurred as a result of travelling to and from the strip offset the savings on the room."
63,477,"May 14 2005	C'mon folks be serious	I stayed at Wild Wild West for about two weeks when I first moved to Las Vegas while I was waiting for my apartment to be ready. The rate was right and since I was working on the strip, it was the right location as well.The room was not one that might be found at the Four Seasons, but it had everything I needed for my stay...a bed and a bathroom.For you people who are complaining about this hotel as if it was a five star resort, you should be ashamed of yourselves. My guess is that the reason you chose this hotel is because it offered the lowest rates...ever hear the expression that you get what you pay for? Hello?Could the front desk staff have been more helpful? Absolutely. But how would you like it if you had a job where people just yelled at you all day long about things that, as a front desk clerk, you have no control over. Maybe if everyone was a bit nicer to these people, they wouldn't come across as defensive and unwilling to help.The WWW is not a perfect hotel...I wouldn't bring anyone here that I was trying to impress, but if you're looking for a quiet room at a good rate and still close to a lot of the Las Vegas action, it's not a half bad pick."
64,477,"May 13 2005	Not worth the trip	This was the first time me and my husband ever went away alone. We been married 13 yrs and was going with a group to Las Vegas. Well we all couldn't get in the same hotel so we booked with Wild Wild West.The price of the room was really cheap, but now I understand why.We were checking in April 12, 2005 and the receptionist made it sound really good that she was giving me a room right at pool side. I was excited, but once I got to my room I looked over at the pool and there it sat no water and a total mess. Not even the hot tub had water in it. Once checking it it was hot as hell, so I went to turn on the air conditioner to find out it didn't work. So I make a call to the fornt desk to request another room and the woman who answered told me that I had to wait for a maintance employee to look at it. After waitting 4 hours I called the front desk again and a man told me the same thing but atleast he had the decency to call back 10 minutes later to tell me that they had an employee look at it before and it was broke so he told me to come and get another room. After getting our new room the first thing I checked was the air conditioner and I was in heaven. The next few days we woke early and only came back to sleep. Friday morning when I woke to get ready to go out I noticed there was little bugs, not one but a lot of little bugs all over the counter where my toothbrush and makeup was, little to say I needed a new toothbrush but we put on hold what we had planned for the day to find a new hotel to stay for the duration of our stay. So if you want a working air conditoner, or you hate waitting for a maintance employee, or IF YOU HATE BUGS then this is not the place to stayAnd don't bother packing the swim suit because there is a hole but no water to swin in. come to think of it , the pool looked like it was sand blasted but nothing else. PS. And No one at anytime even on check in told me the pool was down for any reason."
65,477,May 11 2005	Disgusting nasty filthy	I booked this hotel over the net. Had to pay for it in advance. So when I arrived the hotel already had my money. But I was required to pay a $50 dep. on a room that was already paid for. The room was disgusting. No phone books in room. No maps of Vegas or any info about it. Could only use the phone 30 min. a day and then you were charged so much per minute after that. I was also charged a $4 a day amenity fee for security on parking. I didn't even have a car and the cars are parked out in the open. What's up with that. The ice machine wouldn't work either. They said there is a laundry room on site. I never saw it. Thank god I didn't need to use it. Needless to say my trip was very bad. I will never stay there again. Beware of staying here you are definetly not getting what you pay for.
66,477,"Apr 29 2005	Don't stay at Wild Wild West	This was absolutely the worst hotel experience I've had. The weekend rate of $140 per night for a 10X18 room with only a bed and a small TV was robbery. These rooms have no radio, clock, hair dryer, iron, pictures, nothing. Had to get into the bathtub in order to close the bathroom door. The obvious prostitution market on the sidewalks around the building made me wonder about the safety and security of my car overnight.The only saving grace was the room was very clean. The housekeeping staff does a great job."
67,477,Apr 22 2005	Wild Wild West Was Wonderful	After being dismissed from jury duty early I could not get anything on final four weekend so I settled for the WWW. After reading other reviews I expected serial killers with trouble lurking around every corner. There was no reason to worry. Checking in was easy and the room was very nice for the price. I was never worried or terrified going back and forth to the room. Norman Bates was nowhere to be found. It was an easy 10 minute walk to the Excal on the strip and the coffeeshop has great and cheap food. I deducted two stars because of the very smoky casino and the muchkin showerhead in the bath.
68,477,"Mar 30 2005	get what you pay for	Dont pay more than 30$ to stay here. We were there in Jan so there was very little bad elements ( such as spring breakers ) As a woman I woulnt have wanted to stay here alone because your room door opens to the outside and you could have a room far away from the front desk.The workers were very nice , I drank a lot of free beer gambling. The room was well worn but I was comfortable and I thought the bedding was clean. Very close to the strip."
69,477,"Mar 21 2005 	Scary....	I am a 21 year old female and I stayed here by myself and let me tell you how scary it was! Besides the unkempt bathroom, I was escorted to my room everynight as to not be aproached by men lurking around outside. I even put a chair up against my door at night!"
70,477,"Feb 28 2005	Not to bad.....	I read all these reviews the day before I was to leave for Vegas and believe me I was frightened of what I would find upon check in. When we arrived I was surprised, the place was not at all what the reviews said. The casino was small but the people that worked there were very nice and helpful. Slots were pretty loose as well, so I did pretty good. As far as the rooms go, They were okay, but upon booking the rooms I knew that I was not booking into the MGM Grand or hotel of that magnitude, so to put it simple, the rooms were just about like a Motel 6 maybe just a little smaller. The room served its purpose a place for us to sleep for a minute or two and take a shower. If you plan to spend all your time in the hotel room go to a larger hotel, if you are just wanting an expensive place to go and play then I recommend this one."
71,477,"Feb 12 2005	Be afraid be very afraid	I am a 50 year old corrections administrator who has traveled extensively and this is the only hotel in the good 'ole USA that I felt compelled to prop a chair against the door at night. The room was filthy, furniture was beat up junk, cigarette burns were all over the bathtub. The sheets were - well, I slept on top of the beadspread. Young babes in hotpants were leaving rooms in the morning and I don't think they were there for a religious convention. 1970's Holiday Inns have more ambiance. Stay at your own risk, I lasted one night. After telling the manager of the Station Casino where I had spent the night, he laughed, took pity on me, and gave me a nice upgraded room in the tower for $89."
72,477,"Feb 8 2005	Wow	This is a poor excuse for a hotel. My girlfriend and I were in Vegas for the Superbowl weekend. If I had know what I potential disaster this complex was, I would have spent extra money to stay in a better quality hotel. The room was disgusting. The sheets didn't fit on the bed. I found blood on the walls of the motel and felt very unsafe for me and my girlfriend. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
73,477,"Dec 6 2004	STRAIGHT UP GHETTO!!	Stayed here for two nights the food is the only good thing that and the 2$ min bets on roullette but that is it. There were gangbangers and hookers across the street at the Jack in the Box, definitly not the classiest spot in Vegas but not bad for 30 bucks so make sure to lock your door and check your sheets good thing i was on the strip most of the trip!!!"
74,477,"Oct 22 2004	Bring your own sheets	After reading the reviews on this site, we decided to bring our own sheets and towels. It was definitely a smart move. We called the front desk to ask that housekeeping skip our room because we were afraid our towels and sheets would be taken. The front desk transferred us to housekeeping's voicemail, and we left a message. That day, housekeeping came into our room anyway. They stole one of our towels. I don't even think they cleaned the room. We called them, and they denied receiving our voice message. They also said that there was no way to get our towel back. It was on a truck with a million other towels. We asked to speak with the manager. Oddly enough, the manager was conveniently not available and wouldn't be back until the next afternoon. Of course, we would be gone by then. There was no one else to talk to. You'd think that there would be someone able to compensate us for our loss. It was rediculous. I wouldn't recommend staying at this dump, but if you have to, ask for a non-smoking room and bring your own sheets and towels. Hide your sheets and towels when you leave your room."
75,477,"Aug 20 2004	I survived a night at the Wild Wild West	I barely survived a night at this poor excuse of a hotel. As my boyfriend and I arrived in Las Vegas for the first time, we were exicited. And then we saw and SMELLED our motel room. As we walked up the stairs to our room, we had a lovely view of a truck stop. As we proceeded into the room a stale urine odor filled the room. The ceiling looked as if it was going to collaspe at any minute. The bed was scary (god knows what was lurking in those sheets) The next moring we went for a refund and ended up with a telephone bill that didnt belong to us! Overall, if you have the choice to sleep on in your car or in a free niight at the Wild Wild West (the name fits the motel pefrectly) I suggest sleeping in your car. Its safer, cleaner and proably more comfortable."
76,477,"Aug 6 2004	The Suckist Place in Vegas!!!	This place seemed more like a trailer park than a hotel. I was not only disappointed about the &quot;hotel&quot;, but ashamend and embarrased that I dished out $55 per night to stay here. While searching the internet for a hotel to stay at during my Vegas trip, I had absolutely no idea that Wild, Wild West would be such a train wreck! Please people, when choosing any place to lodge, make sure you read people's comments so that you can get a good feel for the hotel before you decide to book!!!"
77,477,"Jul 6 2004	WILD WEST WASTE!	When shopping on the Internet, the rate looks good but you are better off staying in your car for the night! Stayed during our spring break and what a waste. Dirty rooms, dirty linens, not enough towels, dirty pool, maid entered room when we were sleeping, broken door lock, air conditioning not working...hotel so old and dirty I expected Wyatt Earp to walk out! The only good thing about the hotel...it's next to In and Out Burger!"
78,477,"Jun 6 2004	THE WORST	This is the worst place I have ever checked into. It only took about 5 minutes to decide to call some other hotel to stay, and thank goodness we found one on a very busy weekend!!!!! The room smelled of urine, we were afraid to sit on anything, we were afraid to take our shoes off, the lights did not work and the toilet seat had cigarette burns all over it. I believe they would rather rent these rooms by the hour than by the day. There is a truck stop right behind this hotel (if you get my drift!!!!)DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS BAD, NO IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
79,477,"May 27 2004	YUCKKY	Staying here was out of desparation since all rooms were booked due to conventions, a fight, and World Series of Poker. Booked for 2 nites; the first at $69 and the 2nd at $129!!! So ridiculous since it was a real dump. Stayed just one night and luckily found another room elsewhere. Didn't find all the other yucky stuff that was listed in other reviews, but did seem to be a &quot;dirty&quot; and unsanitary place to stay. Casino was really a bar with a table and machines!Never again!"

1,478,"Oct 19 2009 	Excellent service clean hospitable	I stayed at this hotel - which is about 20 minutes from downtown Las Vegas. I had a medical procedure and the doctor's office recommended this hotel. I was very impressed. The staff bent over backwards to address every need I had. The manager took me to and from the procedure; one of them also did the same for my follow-up the very next day.The hotel had everything I needed and nothing that I didn't need. It was quiet and peaceful. They have a free breakfast buffet everyday - scrambled eggs; bacon/ sausage; a hot waffle iron to make your own fresh waffles; fruit; yogurt, coffee. You get the idea.The cost was totally inexpensive. I stayed for 4 days and have no complaints."
2,478,"Oct 13 2009 	Safety and Sanity outside Las Vegas	We selected this hotel for the last night of our trip to be closer to the airport but away from downtown Las Vegas. This is a clean and comfortable hotel with lovely rooms, comfortable beds, and a free breakfast. I think we paid less than $100! You can get to downtown Vegas within minutes. We did venture downtown and visit the strip and I'm glad we decided against staying there. How dirty it is! I couldn't stand the press of people and the pushy &quot;snappers&quot;. While it was fun to visit some of the casinos, I can't say I like Las Vegas. We enjoyed the fountain show at Bellagio (where $5.00 in a penny slot yielded a jackpot of more than $100 and I walked away happy). The inside of New York, New York was so clever with its reproduction of New York. Still, Las Vegas is not where I want to be found when Jesus makes His return! I have to thank the reviewers of Trip Advisors for steering me to this hotel."
3,478,"Aug 31 2009 	Perfect place if you don't want all the hype of Las Vegas.	This place is really good value for money. Me and my girlfriends arrived 2 days earlier than expected in Las Vegas on our trip around the West Coast of USA, and we choose this Hotel because of the price and the reviews.It is perfect. We visited some of our friends at Luxor the same night we arrived, and we really started to appreciate the quietness and isolation you will find at this Wingate. You have a great view of Las Vegas at nighttime, but the neighborhood isn't that inspiring during daytime.Another plus about this hotel is the amenities. You get free internet, free snacks in the lobby, free business area, free gym and so on. You are really in for a treat here.I've given the location 3 stars, since you'll probably want to stay at the strip if you visit Vegas, but if you are here to experience the city without necessarily wanting to drink your brains out and partying and gambling all day long, this is a good choice. You'll find a lot of well-rated dining facilities in the neighborhood, which are also well-priced."
4,478,"Aug 10 2009 	Top Notch great safe location.	Nice and new hotel, in a safe area. Free parking, internet and hot breakfast. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. Staff was great, rooms were spotless, bathrooms were immaculate. Comfortable queen beds. Nice pool, but didn't use. This hotel is about 6 miles from airport and strip. Restaurants and stores close by."
5,478,"Aug 9 2009 	This is the only place I'll stay in Vegas!	I've stayed in this hotel MANY times and I've never been disappointed! Unfortunately, on my last trip to Vegas last week, the Wingate was booked, so I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Henderson. Big mistake! The staff at the Wingate is always super friendly and accommodating, the coffee is hot and fresh 24 hours a day and the rooms are spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The morning breakfast is excellent and full of variety to include &quot;hotel waffles&quot; that you can make yourself, eggs, bacon, breads, pastries, cereals, fruit and yogurt. I honestly dont know how theyre making a profit with their rates for all thats included. Its my home away from home, and after my horrible experience at the Holiday Inn Express, I will never go anywhere else again!"
6,478,Jul 27 2009 	The hotel was great and the staff was SO helpful!!!	I just spent the past weekend in Henderson with some friends and this hotel came through in a big way for us! We were hoping for a mix of gaming/entertainment and a chance to explore Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam and with the hotel's help we were able to do both!!! They even provided a complimentary shuttle to Green Valley Rach so we didn't have to worry about taxis. Highly recommended!!
7,478,Jul 27 2009 	Elegant  spacious and peaceful with a very attentive staff.	My husband and I stayed at the Wingate for 7 nights. It was a peaceful escape from the Las Vegas scene yet close enough to take in all the amenities that part of our country has to offer. The hotel is new and ever corner has beautiful art work and colors. The staff are very attentive and personal. They are committed to making a stay at the Wingate a memorable one. We would not say anywhere else in the area when we visit again. Highly recommended.
8,478,"Jul 13 2009 	Outstanding ! (I always wanted to say that word on a review)	Almost new (or very-very careful) furniture (specially the pillows !), clean and perfumed, very convenient location (in car, 15 minutes from LV strip), incredible breakfast (specially bacon, sausages, even scrambled eggs on Sundays), free internet, pool and jacuzzi accessible late night... and, yes, gorgeous clerks :)Doesn't this sound good enough ? What else could I say ? Let me think...oh, yeah, THE PRICE. Less than 70$ ? Well, you bet it !I don't know how long this will remain as I experienced, so my suggestion is to visit this as soon as possible while it lasts."
9,478,"Jun 21 2009 	A good hotel away from all the hustle!	Really nice hotel, very helpful staff, very clean, breakfast excellent. Nice gym, small but enough to keep up with your routine. Pool nice with small jacuzzi. Hotel shop for those essentials. Gas station to the left of the hotel for anything else you may need. Only downside would be that there isnt much round it but as we were using it as a base and driving to different areas/attractions it was ok. If you arn't prepared to drive it would be remote.Front view is of the parking lot and in the distance the strip, rear overlooks the pool.10 mins drive away there is plenty of shops &amp; restaurants and in 15 mins you can be in the heart of Vegas. Really enjoyed staying there."
10,478,May 26 2009 	Great value not to far from strip	Well I thought with all of the positive reviews of this property I would give it a try for the holiday weekend. Let me say I was very impressed. The front desk staff bent over backwards to be of help and all was very friendly. The pool area was very nice and only had a few other guests using it so it was quiet. And I found the suburban location very convenient with plenty of stores and services right around the corner. I would make this hotel my choice for a value-packaged location in the Vegas area. The room was spotless and the best was perfect what else can you ask for 89 a night.
11,478,"May 21 2009 	Nice but..	We stayed here 2 times in one year. The staff is really nice, polite and helpfull. The room are clean, big with nice furniture. Breakfast is also good. But the two times we stayed there we had people partying on our floor. And it went on all night. I know that it is not really the fault of the hotel but be prepared on the week end it seems to be a little bit louder. If it werent for that I would recommend it anytime again."
12,478,Apr 17 2009 	Wow!!!	I flew in late one night to Henderson Executive Airport and needed a place to stay for the night. A hotel shuttle came and picked me up @ the airport for free and gave me an awesome pilot discount. They were very helpful about getting a shuttle back to the airport the next day. They had a great full breakfast and papers in the morning as well as free wi-fi. Cannot wait to come back!
13,478,"Apr 10 2009 	A perfect Visit !!	Myself and a friend used the Wingate as a three day stay for golfing......then we went onto the strip for two days. It makes it easier when golfing to stay off of the strip especially when renting a car etc., The Henderson area is very modern, clean and seemed very safe. The hotel welcomed our arrival with professionalism &amp; courtesy. The hotel looks very new. What can I say......this was the absolute perfect choice to what we wanted to meet our needs. We had a car rental and the hotel has plenty of free parking; we awoke each morning to free continental breakfast which had most things a person needed to start the day; free newspaper delivered to the door; in-room safe; After a day of golfing there were many restaurants in the local area within probably a 3-5 minute drive---many, many restaurants to choose from. If you wanted to just do it simple there is a restaurant / pub practically in the same parking lot of the hotel which was very handy - we tried it out twice and nothing wrong with it whatsoever !! We stocked up on beer as the room also had a mini-fridge :)The outdoor pool and most importantly the hot tub were excellent additions to sooth the muscles in the evening with a few cold cervezas !! It was also very quiet.I noticed a workout room with several pieces of equipment - did not use it though.All in all an outstanding choice of hotels for a few days off of the strip. It met all of our needs and expectations.We will definately be back when we are looking for a hotel off strip to meet our golfing needs when visiting Las Vegas.Definately recommend this location for the casual leisure traveller; business traveller and family."
14,478,"Feb 19 2009 	Clean safe location nice pool 	I always rent a car and stay here when I business trip to Vegas. Love the sparkling pool, the friendly staff and the free breakfast."
15,478,"Jan 14 2009 	A wonderful stay	Our family used three rooms and we all loved this facility. Staff were very responsive, the rooms were meticulously clean and the beds were the most comfortable we have ever experienced in a hotel stay. Temperature control was perfect. Morning breakfast was cheerful and very adequate. We stayed here because Courtyard by Marriott near the strip where we usually stay was full ( the CES show was on that weekend) This will be our choice from here on.... thank you for a great experience!!!"
16,478,"Nov 12 2008 	Great Hotel	My husband and I took a business trip to Las Vegas and went out on the weekend prior to his conference. We wanted to see Red Rock Canyon and Lake Meade &amp; Hoover Dam, so we didn't want to stay in the congestion of downtown or the strip. We stayed at the Wingate in Henderson, and needless to say, we were extremely happy with our decision. It was very convenient to get to sites East and West of Vegas. Unlike the hotels with casinos on the strip, we had a refrigerator and microwave in our room, free internet, and a hot breakfast each morning. The other nights we stayed at the Wynn on the strip and got a towel by the side of our bed with slippers that were too small on top of the towel, as well as a piece of candy on our pillow.Both hotels were large and clean. Both had pools, the Wynn's being about 7 times larger, but the Wingate's having 1-2 people in it. Both had hot tubs and exercise rooms, but you had to pay extra if you wanted to use these facilities at the Wynn and the Wingates was free.The only complaint I would have at the Wingate is that the walls were a little thin. At times, we could hear a TV in the next room, but the hotel was full of a high school band, and we were never awakened by the kids - possibly they were just well behaved kids.The Wingate was also very close to restaurants. We walked to the pub in the parking lot of the hotel one night and had a good meal, and the other night, we drove about 2 mile to a restaurant on Eastern, where there are many choices.If I were to go to Vegas again, I would stay at the Wingate and drive downtown in the evenings for shows, etc. It was about a 15 minute drive."
17,478,"Oct 20 2008 	Geat hotel fantastic price good location	My wife and I stayed at the Wingate the nights of October 17-18 and couldn't be happier. STAFF -- Friendly and always willing to answer questions or offer advice for local eateries and activities. Front desk staff was one of the best I've encountered, and the breakfast crew was helpful and friendly.HOTEL -- This hotel, as mentioned by others, is quite new -- not remodeled but NEW -- and is very nice. The pool area is clean and nice, though we didn't use it. We had a king-bed room and were pleased by the size and the quality of the furnishings. Nice dark woods, granite counters. The bathroom is quite big, once again, granite and tile. The showerhead was amazing. The bedroom itself had a large sitting area with lounge chair and ottoman, there was desk with chair and internet cable -- WiFi is available anywhere in the hotel too. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel is one of the new 'green' hotels - you insert your door card into a slot, thereby activating your A/C settings. When you leave the system goes into a 'conservation mode' that reduces energy use. The thermostat is on the wall, so no fiddling with dials on the A/C unit. The hotel has mountain or Strip views, both of which are great. Parking is free and plentiful.BREAKFAST -- The breakfast buffet was standard fare, with fruit, Yoplait yogurt, juices, coffee, hot cocoa, toast, bagels, muffins, and a 'build your own waffle' center. It was good, easy, and included with your stay, a nice touch since most hotels are shying away from this.LOCATION -- We were in Henderson visiting family, but this would also make a compelling alternative when getting away from the strip. From the hotel the Strip is a quick 10-15 minute drive. By 10-15 minutes I mean during a busy Saturday night, not during the middle of the day weekday. Granted once you get to the Strip you slow to a crawl, but that's normal! Easy access to I-15 via I-215, and easy access to Hoover Dam via I-215 as well. It took us about 28 minutes to get to the Dam from the hotel.PRICE -- We were able to get a matched price from a Courtyard in Henderson ($80/night) but even the standard rate of $109-$119 a night is great for the area.CONCLUSION -- We loved our stay at the Wingate and will definitely stay there again. The level of service and quality that you get for the price cannot be beat."
18,478,"Aug 26 2008 	Great place away from hustle 	Found out this place was fairly new, that was a plus.We stayed here our last night in Vegas to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle. It was a great stay. Room and bathroom was as nice as a hotel on the Las Vegas strip and plus you had your own frig &amp; coffee maker which all the big hotels don't. Complimentary breakfast was great as well.Internet access was down, but was repaired quickly. Staff &amp; management was very friendly. Convenient for us to take our rental car back to airport location.It was nice not to have to do so much walking just to get to a room!!All and all we had a great experience with this hotel !!"
19,478,"Jul 14 2008 	Quiet Clean and safe retreat	I was in Henderson for 3 days for work. The Wingate was perfect for my trip. I had free wireless internet and all the quiet and air conditioning I could take to get some projects done in the evenings. The hotel was very very clean and had a very kind and helpful staff. If you needed anything or had a question the staff was on it in a snap.In the morning, the breakfast was delicious. A great spread with different kinds of juice, yogurt, eggs, toast, cereal (with nonfat and 2%) bacon and sausage, and the real treat waffles! Which seemed very fun for the few children I saw there. You could make your own waffles easy, and tasty too!The fitness area was again very very clean and had treadmills, elliptical, weight machine, gymnastic ball, and more. I was able to keep up my daily routine. I didn't get to make it down to the pool, but I am sure it was great as the rest of the hotel was. The nightly rate is fantastic, such a great place for such a value. Smoke free and no ringing slot machines to be concerned with. The photos the I saw on expedia.com were exactly how it looked. But I did take a photo of the view from my room facing vegas. There is a gas station across the parking lot, great to fill up or just grab some vitamin water. The Kopper Keg a bar and grill is in the same lot, I went in but left quickly, smokey and keno at the bar isn't my thing. I end up shopping at the Trader Joe's Market on Eastern for some great food that I could keep in my hotel frig.I highly reccommend this hotel for anyone traveling on business or with a family that would like to experience NV without smoke, noise or casinos."
20,478,"Jun 3 2008 	Large rooms very clean	Never been off the strip before and found Henderson to be a nice change from the hustle/bustle of Las Vegas. We had an anniversary party to attend, therefore, several rooms were blocked for the out of town guests. Had my reservations about staying here at first, but after reading several favorable reviews, I have to agree with everyone else. Rooms are very large, clean and beds were rather comfortable. They offer a free continental breakfast which had many choices and the drive is only 7 miles from the strip, about 15 minutes or less. Very convenient to the airport as well. My only complaint is that the walls are thin, so if the person next door has the TV on, you can hear it in your room."
21,478,"Apr 26 2008	New and Clean	I stayed at this hotel for a business meeting. This hotel was brand new, clean and a great value. I was able to access the Internet easily from anywhere. The staff was very helpful and friendly."
22,478,"Mar 27 2008 	Great hotel and accomodations!	Had one night here before traveling back home. Very nice hotel, clean, friendly service, great rooms. The continental &quot;free&quot; breakfast was fantastic; one of the best ones out of all the hotels we stayed at during our two week vacation. The price at this hotel was great too. Would definitely stay at again if ever back in this area."
23,478,"Mar 5 2008 	Great quiet hotel for business travelers!	It is the first time I stay at a Wingate! I will come back!What a great concept! From the design, to the amenities; everything was terrific. I love the All inclusive rate concept.... free breakfast, free internet, free smile at front desk.... love it!Amazing service; the staff was very attentive to my every need!The shower heads in the rooms are awesome; I have to ask the hotel if Wingate sells them to the public online. I also wanted to point out that people coming to Las Vegas for business purposes, will find this hotel a great to escape from the crowds, noise and casinos. This hotel is only 10 minutes from airport, and 15-20 to the strip.As you can tell, I was impressed! I recommend!!! Great hotel for a picky french traveler!"
24,478,"Mar 2 2008 	Quiet convenient non-gaming hotel - ideal for biz travelers!	Stayed late October to early November of 2007 for 5 days on a business trip.This is a decently built Wyndham property similar in setup to a Springhill Suites by Marriott. It has great (but essentials only) amenities like a business center (2 Dell computers, and a full-size copy/fax/printer by Konica), exercise/weight room, sundries/convenience store, and outdoor pool. The structure is 4 stories tall; the room alignment is straight (in-line) with interior hallways/corridors. There are 2 elevators, and two sets of interior stairways. The hotel rooms face either Southeast (even-numbered rooms) or Northwest (odd-numbered rooms). The lobby is large and welcoming, and the hotels meeting rooms are all on the main floor for easy access. Parking is ample, and available on both the front and back sides of the hotel. The entire building is non-smoking and non-gaming.Access to this property is quite easy from I-215. The Pecos Rd/St. Rose Pkwy exit is recommended, as Eastern Ave is the main shopping street and it gets backed up easily, causing minor delays due to the number of traffic lights involved. If done purposefully, the trip to either the LVCC, McCarran airport, or The Strip takes less than 15 minutes. The front desk staff is young, but friendly. No is not in their vocabulary, and all reasonable requests are met with zero hassle. As a side note, this hotel has 1 jacuzzi suite, located on the main (1st) floor  good luck booking that one, as its usually reserved way in advance, and people have a tendency to stay over their initial booking dates for this room. (That was the problem I experienced on this visit.) They acted quickly to resolve the stay over issue with my reserved Jacuzzi suite, and put me into a 1-bedroom suite. They were also very accommodating with my request for a different room when I didnt care for the one I was initially moved to. Management is responsive to all concerns, including housekeeping issues (like missing toiletries, unmade rooms, and inconsistent cleaning, as I experienced). All efforts were made to ensure my satisfaction.The rooms are well-appointed, with nicer quality furnishings. We prefer the 1-bedroom suites versus the standard rooms, but those are nice, too. In the suite, the bedroom is divided by a set of pocket doors. The bathroom has 2 separate doors for entry, one in the BR, one from the main room. This allows for privacy for all. The suites also have a small balcony to enjoy the weather when its convenient  just dont forget to UNLOCK the door before it closes behind you! The bathroom is larger than average, with a real bathtub and multi-option showerhead. Some nice touches include Neutrogena toiletries, a night-light, and a hair dryer that isnt wall-mounted. The bed is comfortable, with super-fluffy pillows and quality linens. The funky clock radio next to the bed has some pretty cool features like portable MP3 player connector and fall asleep to music option. The bright blue backlight might drive you insane at night, though.Suites have a desk, couch, chair w/ottoman, side tables, coffee table, dining table w/4 chairs, mini-fridge, wet bar, microwave, and coffee maker. Theres lots of lights/lamps to pick from to select the right illumination for your needs. The closet, located inside the entryway, has ample storage, with 8 to 10 hangers, a shelf w/an extra pillow and blanket, ironing board w/ iron, an electronic safe. Climate controls are in both the bedroom and main room, with separate HVACs for each one. There is also a TV in each room, with a chest of drawers underneath for storage. Bring your DVD player and RCA connector cables, as there are connections on the side of the TV for Video and Audio (RCA jacks for video and audio, and the audio input has separate Left and Right for stereo sound). Amenities include an expanded continental breakfast, with a couple of hot items such as eggs and sausage/bacon, and other staples like bagels, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc. The coffee is Wolfgang Pucks brand, and there are usually six different types to choose from. The juice machine has EXCELLENT juices, like real orange juice and cranberry juice. If you need to compute during your stay, Internet access is free, and available in wireless form all over the hotel; in the rooms you can connect directly via hardline (Ethernet cable).Speeds are excellent, and service is consistent.The area immediately around the hotel is mostly devoid of amenities, but the Post Office, HealthSouth rehab center, St. Rose Hospital, convenience store (Seven Hills Chevron), and restaurant at the front of the property (Seven Hills Bar &amp; Grill) are there if you need them. A short drive up the hill to Eastern Ave will lead you to some great restaurants and shopping. If you have a GPS or navigation unit, bring it and use it  the side streets will get you there faster when traffic gets hairy on Eastern. This hotel is also amazingly convenient to the Henderson Executive Airport.HOTEL TIPS:- Go early to breakfast when staying over a weekend  it gets crowded and noisy in the later hours.- Book WAY IN ADVANCE if you want the Jacuzzi suite. Call before arrival to ensure its available and no one is staying over their reservation dates.- The top floors offer great views; Northwest faces The Strip and has great nighttime views (just ignore the parking lot lights out front). Southeast faces the mountains and offers great sunrises. ?- Park in back. Less traffic, less chance for damage. Easy access thru back doors or side doors.- As usual, check out the hotels website before you travel. It will always have additional information not covered in a review.GENERAL TIPS:- If you like sushi, I mean if you REALLY like sushi, go up the street to Sushi Club on Eastern Ave, just North of Horizon Ridge Pkwy. All-you-can-eat sushi for $15 (lunch) or $20 (dinner)! If youve eaten at the Sushi Club in Reno, then this restaurant should be familiar  theyre owned and run by the same great family. I was shocked to find this place in Henderson, and theres no way Id eat at a casino when this place is nearby. BTW, the fish is excellent here  its fresh, well stored, properly handled, and cut masterfully. I cant say enough good things about Sushi Club. Try the Godzilla Roll.- Wal-Mart is off of Eastern and I-215 if you need anything from them. However, a closer place thats less crowded is Kmart, at Eastern &amp; Horizon Ridge Pkwy  just a few blocks East of the hotel. Trader Joes is also in that center, and theyve got a great selection of wine, beer, and other food items. Their packaged meals are excellent, and can be a convenient way to eat well without spending a lot of dough. Perfect for a quick picnic lunch for that 1/2 hour trip to the Hoover Dam.- If you like wine, you cant go wrong with Lees Discount Liquors at the Northwest corner of Eastern &amp; Sunridge Heights Pkwy. Their wine selection is fantastic, and all adult beverages are priced inline with the typical discount liquor stores.- Theres a Lowes Home Improvement store at Eastern &amp; St. Rose Pkwy should you have a need for hardware or tools during your stay.----------------"
25,478,"Feb 12 2008 	Share your breakfast with the homeless here!!	This was my first time staying at a Wingate property. This property is eight months old, so the rooms were in good condition, though the pillows are cheap quality and uncomfortable.The &quot;free&quot; breakfast included with the room rate is similar to that found at other mid-priced hotel chains that offer a complimentary breakfast buffet to paying guests. The key words here are &quot;paying guests.&quot; It was absolutely disgusting to see what goes on in this property's buffet area, which is adjacent to the front desk, so there is no excuse of management in pretending not to notice. If you don't mind sharing your &quot;free&quot; breakfast with the homeless folks who wander in, then by all means, stay here. If you don't mind eating your breakfast with young adults who are barefoot and shirtless, then by all means, stay here. The breakfast employee was oblivious, though she was generous enough to hand out ziploc bags to the homeless so they can empty out the buffet and stuff it all in their bags. I inquired of the front desk staff about the situation, and was duly brushed off with a shrug of their shoulders.No wonder the room rate with the &quot;free&quot; breakfast was higher than other mid-priced properties in the Vegas area - - you will be subsidizing the homeless and the indifferent staff."
26,478,"Jan 31 2008 	Pretty Good	Flew to Vega$ to visit family and friends, and to play.Hotel is in an acceptable location for visiting friends in Henderson/Green Valley area. Checkin was easy. Very clean hotel and almost new it seems. Our king suite w/living room was very nice w/granite counters, sink, fridge, microwave, flat screen tv in living room. Bedroom had a comfy bed and another tv. Bathroom had no tub, only glass enclosed &quot;euro&quot; shower. For those that are &quot;green,&quot; the bathroom had those irritating energy saving compact fluorescent bulbs that take a while to fire up to full capacity. They also had a piece of paper with some &quot;SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT&quot; business about towel and water conservation that all the hotels seem to have nowadays. Save the environment, or save their utility bills?More importantly for me: the toilet area of the bathroom was way too dark. They need another light in the toilet area! I don't know if this is true for all the rooms, or just this configuration.Housekeeping was ok.Breakfast was just ok. The OJ was out of a fountain. The coffee was Ok. There was yogurt and fresh fruit. There was some greasy egg and cheese thing that I didn't eat along with greasy hash brown thing that I didn't eat. They had make your own waffles that were good, but I can't eat waffles more than once a week!Pool was apparently heated somewhat when I stuck my hand in, but still way too cold to be used this time of year. I say they should either heat it HOT, or close the pool for the season. No inbetween stuff! I can't say anything about the jacuzzi, because I didn't examine it.All in all, I would stay here again."
27,478,"Dec 18 2007	Nice place away from the insanity of the Strip	We chose the Wingate in Henderson for its proximity to St. Rose Hospital, where a friend was critically ill. I'm not sure what other reason would compel you to stay in Henderson, but if you do, this is a great place. Actually, I could see it as a decently-priced sanctuary from the noise and glitz. The rooms were large and comfortable, staff was friendly and helpful and it had a very nice breakfast (fresh fuit, juices, waffles, eggs, bacon, etc) included in the price. The room had a coffee maker and fridge--and a comfortable reading chair. The beds were really comfy, too.All in all, if you are a business traveler or just want some quiet (there is no casino in the hotel), this will be a good choice."
28,478,"Nov 15 2007 	I normally stay at 4 Star hotels but this hotel met my expectation	I stayed at this hotel during the week of Comdex. Most of the hotels I wanted to stay at were booked or way too expensive for our budget.Wingate is new, clean and has a modern decor. I especially like the down comforter bed.The &quot;odd&quot; number rooms faces &quot;St. Rose Blvd&quot; and has a view of the Vegas Strip. However, the &quot;odd&quot; number rooms can be noisy especially if you have a &quot;Balcony Suite.&quot;The &quot;Even&quot; number rooms faces the back side, away from the busy streets. This is the quieter side, but you only get a view of the parking lot.There is complimentary breakfast, the food is not that great, but as a traveler, I still appreciate anything complimentary such as internet and breakfast."
29,478,"Nov 6 2007 	My expectations were definitely met!	I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. I needed a hotel to stay at in Henderson that looked comfortable and had free wi-fi. I wasn't interested in staying at a casino, and this was a perfect fit. The hotel still has its &quot;Now Open&quot; signs on there, and it really looked brand new inside there.The room was impeccably clean. I had a comfortable king-sized bed. They had a neat alarm-clock where you could connect your iPod to. The wi-fi connection was fast. The complimentary breakfast was served from 7 to 10, and they had hash browns, sausage, and scrambled eggs. They had a waffle station there, and muffins, and cereal. All great stuff. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'll keep the Wingate in mind next time I go to Henderson."
30,478,"Oct 21 2007 	New hotel great price excellent free breakfast...	We stayed at this hotel because of it's price and close proximity to our family in the area. For what you pay, which isn't much in relation to other hotels in the area, this hotel is an excellent deal. The hotel was just opened in June 2007 and the rooms don't disappoint. Fabulously comfortable beds with soft linens, roomy bathrooms with granite countertops. comfy armchairs with ottomans to relax in...I could go on and on. We had good wireless internet in our room and enjoyed the free breakfast served downstairs. They have all the typical cold stuff, but also eggs, bacon and hash browns and waffle makers for you to make your own fresh waffles. I can't say enough good things about this hotel, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and it is such a good value. The only negative I could find would be that the doors to the rooms are very noisy, you can hear your neighbours doors being closed because they are so heavy. Other than that, great hotel!"
31,478,"Oct 17 2007 	Great Newly Built	The Wingate in Henderson, NV was newly built and opened in June, 2007. The hotel staff were very courteous. Being new, the room was in excellent condition. They have a contemporary chocolate brown and sky blue theme throughout the hotel. Granite countertops and bathtub walls adorned the bathroom. Free Wi-Fi, decent TV channel selection, microwave, mini-fridge, comfortable beds, and spectacular fourth floor view of Las Vegas and the strip made for a very pleasant stay. For the green-conscious guests, the Wingate also uses fluorescent bulbs. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
32,478,"Sep 30 2007 	Good value for business class hotel away from the strip	I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the lobby. Wingate seems similar in class to Marriott Courtyard/Hilton Garden, but I found it more upscale with contemporary furnishings in both the lobby and rooms. It was very clean. Bathrooms have granite countertops and Neutrogena bath products. Nice chair and ottoman in the room, along with a desk. They have a business center (really two internet kiosks) in a small room off the lobby - the rooms also have both free wired and wireless internet access. They offer a free hot continental breakfast - waffles, eggs, sausage, bagels, muffins, juice, cereal, yogurt, coffee with flavored cream. There is also a small frig. and a coffeemaker in the room and a sundry shop. No room service and no in-room movies. Many restaurants and stores within a mile or two from the hotel. The strip is several miles away. The only downside was that the doors to the rooms make a lot of noise,when closing, no matter how quiet you might try to be."
33,478,"Sep 21 2007 	Vegas Gem	Great non casino hotel. Safe for the kids. New,clean and great staff"
1,479,May 17 2009 	Off strip but nice place	Stayed here in April 2009 with a group of 6 women to celebrate a 40th birthday. The property was nice
2,479,May 11 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	Our annual supercross trip to Vegas included 1 mom and 3 teenagers. We usually stay at the Venetian
3,479,Mar 15 2009 	Very nice place	We stayed here from December 27-30
4,479,Aug 4 2008 	Great resort away from the glitz and glam	Some friends and I stayed at this resort this past April for a combined convention trip and girlfriend getaway. The resort and rooms were very nice and clean. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was slightly small but very nice. There were 4 of us and it was enough space. The rooms were nicely decorated and had ample closet space. They also had a full kitchen and washer and dryer and we got use out of both. It was really convenient and saved us money not having to eat out all the time. The resort had a pool
1,493,Oct 14 2009 	Don't expect hospitality courtesy or assistance	We booked this hotel as a place for our son and daughter-in-law's honeymoon in London. Months before they arrived we arranged with the hotel to pay for their stay with our credit card
2,493,Sep 24 2009 	Be warned you pay for what you get....	I took a punt on a lastminute.com deal for a recent trip to london and quite frankly was disappointed. In letter to LM.COM I felt like I had been offered a night with Cheryl Cole and George turned up. It is a B&amp;B
3,493,Aug 6 2009 	just ok	We needed a room for one night only and this hotel was the cheapest i could find with available parking. We paid £82 for the room and £10 per day for the car park - cheap by london standards!This hotel is set in a nice area and i felt safe at all times. The reception area looks nice but that is about it
4,493,Jul 1 2009 	Clean comfortable friendly staff and great location	My husband and I stayed here last week during a bit of a heat wave in London. We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning and the front desk staff allowed us to leave our luggage in the lobby while we went sightseeing and our room was prepared. When we arrived back at the end of the day
5,493,Apr 29 2009 	Horrible hotel	I booked the Abbey Court Hotel through Lastminute.com as a secret hotel. It was advertised as a 4* hotel in Kensington with luxury jacuzzi bath.In reality it is very poor. 2* is more than generous for this hotel and I think 1* is entirely realistic. Service was non existent. The room was pokey and the decoration was at least 30 years old. The room was badly over priced and did not include breakfast. If you are paying more than £50 for this hotel
6,493,Apr 23 2009 	Too expensive	It's been said by other - do not accept rooms 1-5 in the basement. We've never paid so much money for a room with a view into a wall - and with limited light coming in.Staff was not very friendly
7,493,Apr 20 2009 	WAY Overpriced	I booked this hotel using lastminute.ie &quot;Secret Hotel&quot; service. I thought a 4 star hotel in Notting Hill for 140 (£125) per night - room only - was great value and I had never used the &quot;Secret Hotel&quot; system before. This is not a hotel; it's a house so I think it should be called a B&amp;B (except you have to pay £9.50 per person for breakfast). If you stay here and they put you in rooms 1-5 ask to be relocated as you are in the basement with no light into the rooms and everyone has breakfast beside your door from 7:30am. Constant clattering of cutlery and tableware made it impossible to sleep in. The Jacuzzi is a rather small bath but it does circulate water. The bathroom was so cramped we didnt bother trying the jacuzzi. You have to pay £10 for them to give you the wi-fi password (I didnt pay
8,493,Apr 18 2009 	A very comfortable and enjoyable stay!	I loved this hotel. The tube station was just down the street....the Tesco Metro (grocery store) and Post Office very close
9,493,Mar 25 2009 	Believe the reviews......No way 4 star!!!	Trust me the bad press you see about this hotel is correct. How on earth this is a star hotel god only knows. we booked through late rooms where the normal nightly price was supposed to be £300...and we got it for £99. The room was dirty
10,493,Mar 15 2009 	Remember it is a 4* Town House - Not Hotel	Very nice appearance from the outside
11,493,Oct 27 2008 	Old and Tired	Hotel is old and tired and could do with complete makeover. Rooms tiny. Definitely not a 4* hotel!!!	
12,493,Jul 25 2008 	False web advertising	The location of the hotel is good
13,493,Jun 15 2008 	Pick your room carefully	The AA hotel guide from 2004 rated this hotel as a 4 star
14,493,Feb 22 2008	Terrible Experience and it continues......!!	They charged the room twice deliberately
15,493,Nov 27 2007	Would't recommend it...to anyone!	The hotel is in great location
16,493,Nov 14 2007 	Severely disappointed	On arrival at the Abbey Court Hotel
17,493,Jun 24 2007 	Wonderful!	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Abbey Court. I wish I would have booked for longer. The room was quiet and very comfortable and very clean. It was really a pleasure to stay. I would highly recommend the Abbey Court to anyone. Thank you
18,493,Jun 12 2007 	Not Impressed	Although described as a boutique hotel this is actually a B&amp;B. The location is great but I had the same problems as most others. In summary these are as follows. My room was tiny. There is no air-conditioning and no lifts so I was glad I was only on the first floor. The voile did not reach to the bottom of the window. The toilet handle was broken and the seat would not stay up. Also
19,493,May 12 2007 	Perfect for One	In reading other reviews I seriously think some people are reviewing the wrong hotel. (there are 2 Abbey Courts)Except for a couple of minor things I would give this hotel an exceptional rating especially for a woman visitor.one minor thing is the door to rm uses a skeleton key. No security latch inside. At night I would put my suitcase in front of door as an added precaution. the other being the cord for the tea/coffee pot was not long enough to reach the plug from the table. I had to sit it on floor to heat water. However the instant coffee was very good for an instant. and my favorite cookies as a bonus. Walkers shortbread.However the security in this hotel is great
20,493,Mar 29 2007 	Not a bad place...	I was of course apprehensive when I read some of the scathing reviews on this hotel
21,493,Mar 18 2007 	False Advertising	My fiancee and I shelled out quite a pretty pound for this place
22,493,Feb 22 2007	Dont panic it's ok	I have just stayed one night at the Abbey court and do not understand the bad reviews we found it very peaceful and the staff helpful. The location could not be closer to a tube within easy reach of central london. There is also a very good greek place to eat acorss the road called GREEK AFFAIR. FOR £100 WITH BREAKFAST IT WAS A FAIR DEAL IN CENTRAL LONDON SOMETHING WE BOOKED AT THE LASTMINUTE. Believe me there are far worst places so if you stay here just chill out and expect a good old fashioned B&amp;B at least everything worked unlike some upmarket plasma screens that dont work!	
23,493,Feb 18 2007 	One of the worst experiences ever	We had to book a place in a hurry and came over a dropped our things. The price was high 150£. That night we arrived and they still had not brought our luggage to our room. No one offered to help. When we arrived the rooms was filthy
24,493,Dec 7 2006 	The staff went above and beyond what was necessary	After a disasterous booking at another hotel
25,493,Nov 28 2006 	Shabby and unfriendly	We found the Abbey Court on Tripadvisor and hoped that some of the negative reviews were due to the fact that there are
26,493,Oct 20 2006 	if you're desperate only	This is NOT a boutique hotel. The best thing about this place is its the location near Notting Hill tube.Other than that the staff barely speak english and the place feels like you'll die of ricketts if you stay too long. If you are a guest in this country please don't think this is normal.	
27,493,Jul 21 2006 	no air conditioning	Just returned from 3 nights at this hotel from 16th July whilst London was going through something of a heatwave Although its listed as a four star hotel
28,493,Jul 20 2006 	Friendly staff in family athmosphere	We stayed for 7 nights in July 06 while record heat in London was climbing every day. However all of the the staff at the Abbey Court hotel remained courteous and friendly at all times. Remarkable!The room allocated was on the second floor (no lift) which was spacious enough for the two of us. While the heat was concentrating under he roof - a fan brought relief. This is quite an exceptional summer! Nice breakfasts plus newspapers are served in the conservatory. ´We´d recommend this hotel to pepple looking out for a convenient location (Notting Hill gate) friendly staff and cozy rooms.	
29,493,Jul 12 2006	Unimpressed with The Abbey Court Hotel	We paid £112.00 per couple for 1 nights stay in this hotel. It looks great from the outside but inside its not so good. We were put into a room in the basement which was dark and cold. The carpets and furniture were all stained and the iron left marks on our clothes. The bathroom was tiny and dirty. Overall we were very unimpressed.	
30,493,Jul 11 2006 	My home away from home in London	If you are looking for a stylish town house hotel at a fashionable address in London
31,493,Jan 21 2006	Quaint charming comfortable good location	Very much enjoyed our stay at Abbey Court and recommend it to others. We stayed here on the recommendation of a very hip Londoner friend of mine.PROS1) Attractive old Victorian property with lots of old quirks
32,493,Dec 5 2005	Do not stay at this hotel - they will try to steal your money	The management of this hotel is just terrible. They're out to rip people off of their money. Due to unforeseen circumstantces we were not able to stay at the hotel - we had a bunch of flight cancellations and then when we got to London and asked for the address to Abbey Court we were given the address to a different Abbey Court. So needless to say we stayed at a different Abbey Court. But because we had a reservation they proceeded to charge us for one night stay although it was no fault of ours that we didn't make it there. The other Abbey Court close to Paddington Station is so much better. The service there was great and the price for the rooms were very reasonable. Just don't stay at this Abbey Court in Kensington or they may try to charge you for a whole bunch of extra money and refuse to refund your money.	
33,493,Nov 13 2005	Great old world charm	I stayed at the Abbey Court with my father for a night and found the hotel to be excellent. OK the rooms weren't the largest but were excellently equipped (tea/coffee making
34,493,Nov 7 2005 	don't go there	I stayed in single room for one night (GBP 99.-) and it was old
35,493,Oct 31 2005 	So Higgins and Eliza	A terrific location
36,493,Oct 22 2005	Highly recommended	Just a few days ago I came back from London
37,493,Aug 5 2005	Nice surprise	We arrived at this hotel after being moved from another hotel due to problems with their rooms. We were expecting a hotel of equal size (100 rooms) but this had only 21 rooms. Upon check in we were greetly warmly but I was still worrying about the size as it appeared to be just a b&amp;b and the fact it didn't have a bar or restaurant. We were on the top floor so a bit of a trek up 4 flights of stairs! The room itself was a great surprise as we expected it to be tiny but was very roomy. We had a king size bed with quality furnishings. They even had a selection of books and magazines on a table. There was plenty of tea
38,493,Jul 9 2005	Reviews Overstated	We stayed here on the recommendation of our travel agent (she's fired). The room they gave us for $300 plus a night was cramped
39,493,May 4 2005	Abbey Court Hotel [Pembridge Gardens]	we stayed two nights in April at the Abbey Court Hotel by Notting hill Gate. Great location..wonderful friendly knowledgable staff . The manager even walked us to get our bus tickets and showed us where to go. Our room was a decent size
40,493,Feb 24 2005	A romantic getaway	The Abbey Court Hotel claims to be the place to go for a romantic weekend...and it certainly is! My boyfriend surprised me a few days before Valentine's Day by announcing we were going to London. Not the most romantic guy I expected him to have arranged a run of the mill B&amp;B for us. But he really got it right this time!The Abbey Court was the perfect choice for our romantic weekend - champagne
41,493,Feb 16 2005 	Pure Romance	I found this hotel on the web and was planning a surprise for my wife for Valentines day
42,493,Dec 6 2004 	A real London Gem	After a bad stay at another hotel I checked out and moved to the Abbey Court Hotel in Notting Hill for the rest of my weekend. It was superb. The staff were great
43,493,Nov 14 2004	Disappointing	Yes
44,493,Oct 26 2004	Wonderful Stay Here	Stayed at The Abbey Court Hotel Pembridge Gardens in July 2004 and found it to be a most comfortable and clean Hotel
45,493,Apr 8 2004	A romantic retreat in the heart of Notting Hill	We have just returned from an 8-day stay at the Abbey Court Hotel
46,493,Dec 4 2003	A rarity 	We loved this boutique hotel. We found the rooms very clean
47,493,Sep 27 2003	Small lovely ... though a few problems	We recently stayed at the Abbery Court for two nights as we travelled around Europe. I would say in general that for the outrageous prices of London hotels that this hotel was on par. The hotel is a small townhouse in a quiet

1,496,Very Clean room helpful staff -shame about the breakfast	Paid 69 pounds for single room with ensuite which is good value for central London. Very near museums. Everything very clean and plenty tea and coffee in room..Stayed 2 nights and bed linen was changed on second day. very quiet position and no traffic noise.Staff very friendly.Very disappointed with breakfast : website makes big feature of &quot;Organic breakfast&quot;- home baked muffins and home made granola....all that was on offer was cereal and toast and weak tasteless coffee.Either the hotel is under new management or else owners are having to make economies in which case they should remove misleading description of breakfast on the website.
2,496,Nov 12 2009 	Another Great Stay	My second time in a year staying at the Abcone and again had a great stay. Let me keep my bags there as my room wasn't ready. Room was clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly and the location is awesome. I will stay again next year as I pass through London.
3,496,"Oct 14 2009 	Used this hotel 4 times	I have used this hotel 4 times, its clean, quiet, the staff are helpful, it was my husbands birthday, the staff left a box of chocolates and a birthday card in the room for him, very thoughtful.The hotel is near Gloucester Road underground, museums, supermarkets, restaurants and Hyde Park.If you are British, I would recommend this hotel, Americans are used to a higher standard so bear this in mind."
4,496,"Jul 29 2009 	No sense of hospitality would not recommend	I arrived at the Abcone with high expectations. I expected a very sweet place, but instead found it to be a typical shabby London hotel where there is no sense of customer service. First I was told the room was 20A but it was not even written down, and due to the accent I thought he said, &quot;28&quot; so I went and tried someone else's room! And this was on the third floor! I then returned and got the right room number but my room card did not work. Again up the stairs. I then asked for wireless and was told it was down. I also asked for an iron. I mean, this is supposed to cater for business guests, right? No iron in sight, and finally by 10pm I told them to forget about it; just as well as he had not managed to locate an iron. The room (single) was dark and very basic. If you expect any amenities this is not for you.Shower pressure low. The real surprise was the breakfast; it lists 'organic breakfast' on the website. Do you consider Kellogs packaged muesli as organic... no fresh fruit, no yogurt, we are talking BASIC. The wait staff walked around looking like slobs, wearing sweat suits and no one bothered to come around for tea as I sat for 10 minutes. I decided to leave knowing I'd find something much better elsewhere. Thankfully I left and found a local cafe, thereby forfeiting the included &quot;Organic breakfast&quot; - after getting a glimpse of the scene I did not trust what would come out of that kitchen. The sense of apathy was very high. This is not a place that seems to care about serving or hospitality. Why run a hotel if that is the case? I was very disappointed and would advise not to stay here, unless you really have no expectations and just want a super basic place to sleep."
5,496,"Jun 17 2009 	Ok place to stay	We stayed for one week in this little peaceful place. The room was big enough for us three, facing a small interior and absolutely no noise from the street. Quite clean exept the spotted carpet and some mold in the bathroom walls. On cloudy weather the room was a bit damp and cold, but got soon warm when the sun shined. The beds were okay and sheets were changed almost every day,and the towels every day. There was always hot water but not cold water in the evenings so we picked some drinking water from the near shop.The breakfast was quite ligh: cereals, toast, cheese and marmelade, orangejuice, milk and coffee. But on the street when walking to the tube there were many places offering food. And an exellent Waitrose-market open from 8 am to 9 pm! The situation was one reason we chose this hotell, a short walk to three tubelines, to many museums and even to Harrods and other big shops. This was very useful during the tubestrike. And silence was important for us too, a good nights sleep made it possible to run all days around the town.The staff was okay and provided everything we asked, but some of them had difficulties in understanding english, for example when asked an extra blanket and sheet we got just two sheets and no blanket at first."
6,496,"May 31 2009 	Very easy access to public transit	I booked the Abcone for it's proximity to the Gloucester Road Tube Station which is 2 blocks away. The hotel it self was clean and quiet. The single rooms are little small but adequate. There is a free minibar which was a nice touch. There is plenty of restaurants and pubs around the tube station. The breakfast was okay and is served in the basement. I would skip the internet which is expensive and go to the internet cafe on Cromwell. Just make a left out of the hotel, at the corner cross the street, turn left on Cromwell and it's a few doors down. Less than 1 pound an hour. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Central London."
7,496,"May 14 2009 	Awful would never stay again or recommend	Having seen some of the negative reviews of this hotel on trip advisor before booking I was a little put off but have experienced this before and some of the other places I have stayed in have turned out to be very nice. Unfortunately this was not the case here. Me and my partner booked a double room for one night. We arrived at the hotel at around 1.15pm and were told to come back at 2pm as that was check in time (despite the hotel being empty). When we came back we were booked in and went to find our room - a twin room. Having paid three pounds short of 100 we went back to the reception and explained we had paid for a double - receptionist was very rude and seemed agitated about changing our room to what we had paid for. Finally got a double but the room itself was disgusting and below basic standards. Stains all over the carpet, we did not have a double bed just 2 singles pushed together the bathroom smelt of sewerage and the sheet on top of the bed looked like it had seen better days. When we later came back from the theatre the hot water wasn't working we had to let it run for 20 minutes only to have luke warm water. In the night the mini-fridge in our room was buzzing so loudly we had to turn it off (after only a few hours sleep because of this I woke up the next day with awful back pain because of how uncomfortable the bed is). When we woke up my partner said he had heard a mouse in the night, which given the state of the place doesn't surprise me. Needless to say we didn't have breakfast there. Overall the 'hotel' was a real let down - yes in London you need to pay hundreds to stay somewhere acceptable but come on there should be basic health and hygiene standards. Good location as so close to the tube but there are other hotels near by that offer better accommodation for the same price- thank god we were only there a night. PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS THEY ARE GENUINE!!!"
8,496,"Apr 27 2009 	Good Hotel and Great Position	For London standard this hotel is very good especially because of its great position close to a tube station (Gloucester Road), in an excellent district as South Kensington. Rooms and bathrooms are not very roomy but clean and comfortable, always with kettle and coffee/tea supply. Receptionists and breakfast buffet are on average."
9,496,"Feb 23 2009 	Do not stay here!	Dodgy has hell! Stayed one night with a colleague last week. Though I got a bargin - 59 for a Delux Double with breakfast booked through the hotels own website. If the trip was any longer than an overnighter, we would have booking into the Holiday Inn across the road.I had enamel taps that were painted white with gloss, blood stains (and not small drops - pools) on the carpet, I had to get drunk to brave getting into bed. No hot water either from taps or shower, not good as I had a v.important meeting the next day"
10,496,"Feb 17 2009	1st I book my flight then I call The Abcone	I have traveled from NY to London over a dozen times since 1987, all of them for pleasure. My first trip I stayed across the street at what was then called the London Forum Hotel through a BA offer. A very nice, but typical 27 story hotel. Knowing that I would be back in London again, I scouted the area for the more 'affordable' and 'quaint' hotel. Spotting The Abcone I noted the address and phone number.Sure enough I had to return to London and I contacted The Abcone to inquire about their hotel, accommodations and rates. Satisfied with my decision I then booked my stay.Now, everyone knows a family run 40 room hotel will not decoratively compare with a 400 room incorporated hotel chain nor compete with its luxuries. But I felt I had found a home away from home feeling I prefer. I was a name not a room number so to speak. The staff and owner were always there on hand. My room was spacious enough for my travel companion and me. The ensuite bathroom was just fine and there was enough space and hot water. Though this is not a modern interior everything was clean, in good condition and in its place. I dont eat a big breakfast, but do enjoy morning coffee; juice and roll or toast and I chose that over something heavier. There are a few places within a 3-5 min walk to experience how Londoners do a big breakfast.Being a heavy duty sightseer the hotel location was near perfect for me. An ideal base. With short 3/5 minute walk to the Gloucester Road Tube Station with 3 popular tube lines to choose from!! I could easily run back to the hotel to drop off things collected through the day, change clothes, or take a nap. There are plenty of places to dine and shop for essentials and late night snacks.The second time I stayed at the Abcone my brother lost his passport, a travelers biggest nightmare. Upon notifying the desk, Ali, the owner called to say he had instructed the staff to have a look for it, provided a photocopy he had taken of his passport, given us the address, phone number, directions to the US Embassy and offered to get us a cab. Over the years Mr. Ali, or his Uncle Rayani, was always there to say a hello. and accomodate guests.This is much of the reason I always stay at The Abcone when in London, and will continue to do so.

11,496,"Jan 21 2009 	Don't be fooled	Having stayed at a few hotels over the years gives me the right to complain which I rarely do! This place, however, leaves me no choice. The price cannot justify it 100 pounds a night! No shower curtain, no wash cloth, no shampoo, tiny soap bar, 4 TV stations barely visible, twice woken up by fellow asking aboutany tea or coffee needs, green light shining into room from terrace,window open after cleaning regardless of cold temperature, no extrablanket, no radio, 2 tiny chairs to sit, the breakfast was near to being the biggest joketoast and cereal, OJ, slices of cheese all this for 100 pounds a nightI stayed 3 nights getting more irritated finally left went stayed at Hilton for 55 pounds night glorious breakfast and superb room.As long as we support these blatant ripoffs they will continue. Don'teven think about staying here (Abcone). This is no reflection on the staff whowere quite nice, its the owners who should know better or just don't care! Shop there are way better hotels for way better prices and don'trip you off so blatantly! Totally disgusted and its not &quot;Hey this is London!&quot; is no excuse for this rip!"
12,496,"Dec 30 2008 	Tiny room but could be nice with some effort	We chose the place based on the description on the hotel website. They clearly had some good marketing people that chose the best aspects to highlight. It looks pleasant enough from the outside, part of a block of typical London town homes (I believe this hotel was originally two homes).Our room was on the second floor facing the back. There is a lift but it is very small, clearly an afterthought, and two people and luggage won't fit. We used it as a dumbwaiter for the bags and walked the stairs ourselves. Our room was probably once a bedroom when it was a private home, but the bathroom and the lift shaft were carved out of the original space so it was the size of a large bathroom, smaller than our stateroom on the ship we had just disembarked. There was just enough room to get in the door and circumnavigate the bed. The furniture was modern-ish and sensible and the bathroom, though quite small, was beautifully tiled (obviously added later) and sparkling clean. However, the carpet in the room itself and mattress pad were both grubby.The website calls the breakfast &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;gourmet&quot;, I forget which, and claimed it was included but that was a little ambiguous. Full English breakfast was optional/extra. The included breakfast was a adequate but spartan Continental setup. The space where it is served is very pleasant greenhouse-ish room on the basement level. Service is perfunctory at best.In summary, if you want someplace relatively inexpensive (for London, which is -- in general -- outrageously overpriced) in a convenient area (a block from the very pleasant Waitrose supermarket and tube station) this is a tolerable choice but don't expect what you see on the website unless they've done some cleaning and attitude adjustment."
13,496,"Oct 23 2008 	Pretty damn awful	Tiny room without even enough space to open my suitcase, awful shower with no water pressure, poor quality mattress and bedding, and TV was only a 14 inch.Then there was breakfast, ok there was cereal and milk, and they would even bring you toast, but the additions to this were jam or processed cheese slices.For the price I think they should invest more in the cleanliness of the hotel and quality of the rooms. There is NO excuse for poor showers and cheap mattresses, when you can stay at a Holiday Inn for the same money and get a consistently high service.Basically, if you want to feel like you're paying 100 pounds a night for a hostel room, go for it, otherwise, don't bother staying here until they sort it out."
14,496,Oct 13 2008 	great hotel in london	Great hotel . Friendly stuff. More than you expect from a London Hotel.
15,496,"Oct 9 2008 	Good for a short stay	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in a twin room. The room was clean and nice but quite small. The bathroom was nice and clean. Staff were friendly. There wasnt much room for suit cases in our room. It is a good place to stay if you can get a room for a decent price and if you are only staying a few days. If you are staying longer you may want a bigger room so you'd have more space, especially if 2 of you are sharing. It is in a great central location, near the tube, buses and taxi rank near by. I would stay here again."
16,496,"Sep 25 2008 	Lovely Little Hotel	We stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights August 2008. The location is fabulous and is definately the better side of London to stay - The 1st time we visited London we stayed near Aldgate East which was a real dodgy side of town however this hotel was in a really pretty &amp; quiet area and only a short trip to Harrods :-) The hotel is only a short stroll to Gloucester Road tube station , restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. The hotel was very clean and comfortable and the rooms were large and spacious. Staff were polite and kind and allowed us to store our luggage for the day after checkout. Next time we go to London we will definately stay at this hotel !"
17,496,"Sep 17 2008 	Perfect Location	I stayed at the Abcone Hotel for 2 nights September 2008. The location is perfect being 1-1/2 blocks from Gloucester Road tube station but on a quite side street. Nearby were plenty of restaurants and a supermarket. I had a single ensuite room which was quite small but adequate with everything needed by the single traveller. When in London you don't spend much time in your hotel room! It was quiet, clean, secure with TV, tea/coffee making, mini bar and a fan. Continental breakfast was served in the basement and included in the tariff of 55 GBP booked online direct to hotel. I reckon I got a bargain. My flight out was at 10:15pm and the hotel happily stored my luggae for the day after I had checked out. In my opinion - the perfect hotel for single travellers of any age."
18,496,"Jun 5 2008	Pleasant stay	As a group leader of 13 Italian tourists, I stayed at the Abcone in June 2007; we were pleased with our stay. The location is perfect: just 3/4 mins' walk to Gloucester Road Tube Station, the area is very quiet. Rooms and bathrooms are clean.Breakfast a little bit poor and ... starts at 8:30am on Sundays! (had to leave withour having breakfast, which was a bit disappointing). On the whole, it is good value for money and I would recommend this Hotel. I will certainly stay there again next time."
19,496,"Apr 14 2008 	quite a relief!	I had been looking for a suitable hotel for a small group of ladies celebrating birthday weekends on a medium budget. Just after booking a couple of quite negative reviews appeared here and I was a bit worried! However, we had a great stay.Plus points: Rooms were all clean, and looked fairly recently furnished.Triples were large, Doubles more compact but still fine for a couple of nights.Soft drinks in minibar were 1 each, yes, more expensive than shops, but cheaper than most other london hotels I've stayed in!All our rooms had nice powerful showers, some over bath, some walk-in.We were able to store our luggage for several hours before and after our stay.The receptionist let us check into our rooms early (tho obviously this will just depend on if they have been vacated early and cleaned)Breakfast was available until 10:30 on Sunday, and was adequate for us (Juice/coffee/cereal and plenty toast).Only 200 yards from Tube and Taxi Rank.Several pubs/bars/cafes/supermarkets available in a 5 minute walk, and only 10 mins walk to the V&amp;A, Natural History and Science museums.Quiet side-street location rather than facing directly on the busy Cromwell/gloucester Rds.Room for Improvement:The water never seemed to run cold, which wasn't too pleasant for tooth brushing.The website mentioned a bar but, when we arrived there wasn't one. I thought it was my own mistake, but checking again it's still mentioned (although the main page with picture of it is gone). We were obviously a bit disappointed, but there was a large bar under the monsterous looking holiday inn next door and several shops so you could buy your own for late night consumption without feeling guilty!I think overall that it is of the same or higher standard to other london hotels of the same price - they are all expensive for what they are, but for anything cheaper you are probably going to book 6 months in advance, very last minute or stay in a youth hostel, all fine at times, but not always possible! Both myself and other members of the group agreed we'd be very happy to stay here again."
20,496,"Apr 2 2008 	Great Hotel for the Price	I knew this hotel from living next door in college. We decided to stay there since I was familiar with the area. It is right behind the Gloucester road tube station so you have immediate access to public transportation and can be anywhere in minutes. The hotel is small, clean, quiet and very accommodating. When My husband and I checked in, we realized that I had booked us in two twin beds. the hotel was very accommodating and changed our rooms for us. then, when we went to Normandy for the weekend, they let us store our bags there for a minimal charge rather than having to take them with us. For those who complain about small rooms, I think they have not traveled in Europe much. the rooms here were a bargain for the price! I would definitely go again."
21,496,"Apr 2 2008 	Do Not Go To This Hotel	In short, only go to this hotel if you like being made out to be a con artist and if you love being ripped off.If you are going to book the hotel, I advise you to book directly through them via their website.When I arrived they did not no I had made a booking through www.octopustravel.com It took over an hour for the receptionist to understand I had paid in advance after him swearing and being very uncooperative and rude. I had to pay 120 for 2 nights and when the manager was in I would get a refund!! Service in all was appalling, the rooms were basic, nothing special (which was fine) but the carpets are filthy. Windows broken and would not open.I was horrified when in my towel a man came bursting in the room asking if I wanted room service!When checking out I spoke to the manager about my concerns and he laughed it off not even apologising.All in all I would not recommend this hotel to anybody."
22,496,"Mar 1 2008 	Wouldn't recommend...	How should one take a shower when the water is boiling hot and the thermostate broken and there's anyway no cold water at all?Maybe that this is a typical London Hotel illness,but this is not the free ticket for the Hotelliers not to do anything about it.The phone plug was broken,tv and hairdryer ok,as well as the furniture,but a dirty carpet could not convince me to like it,though the price was ok.Thin walls,not really a place to get some sleep.Be aware:no light on the nightstand,nor on the desk."
23,496,"Mar 1 2008 	Not Clean!!	We had originally booked to stay here for 2 nights but changed at the last minute to just 1...I'm glad we did! The room was an OK size but was a bit shabby. The carpet was stained and around the skirting boards and behind the bed clearly hadn't been vacuumed since, well, ever! There was also no hot water in the shower. I guess for the price though you can't really complain too much and the location was good"
24,496,"Feb 18 2008	Great location poor cleanliness 	Loved the location 3 mins from Glochester tube station, it was also on Big Bus Tour route, the room was what I would expect for the price, though on arrival towels smelt (I suspect maybe room was dormant for a couple of days, towels were hung over an opened toilet bowl thou grand after that) and bed was made with clean sheets but with a old fashioned blanket, one bed had a cover which was swiftly taken off, no air conditioning (window opened) and got quite warm at night, a continental breakfast was included in our stay so when we asked for toast we did not expect to be charged for a English Breakfast at check, but they did take it off the bill. Information leaflets in the hotel were out of date, a whats on guide detailed Nov 07 activities and when we enquired about a bus tour we were presented with a leaflet so glad we had done our own research. It is in a beautiful area and for minimal changes this has the potential to be a little treasure."
25,496,"Feb 13 2008 	On a quiet street in a great location	The hotel is on a quiet side street in a residential area which gave it a restful feeling. But it is only 1 block to the Piccadilly Underground and shopping district.The room was on the small side and the bathroom on even the smaller side. But everything was very clean, and fresh-looking &amp; lots of hot water. The entire room was lit by a huge window that opened!Ideal room for a short stay. We skipped the hotel breakfast and walked around the corner to a neighborhood restaurant."
26,496,"Dec 8 2007 	Loved the hotel.	We stayed at this hotel for 67 pounds/night. It was extremely cheap, and the room was fantastic. It was rather spacious compared to other hotels in London. The bathroom in our room was beautiful and spotless. It looked like brandnew. The breakfast room had big windows, and very bright. There were not many negatives, but maybe the wall was a bit thin, because we could hear the next door. However, over all, it was a fantastic stay."
27,496,"Nov 18 2007 	Worst hotel in the World	Our stay was booked through laterooms this is the email I sent them the morning after our visit.It isn't often that I feel the need to complete a feedback form, and I cannot remember the last time I truly complained however, having just had my worst stay ever in a hotel anywhere in the world I feel the need to tell you about the Abcone Hotel, 10-11 Ashburn Gardens, London SW7 4DG. This is supposed to be a three star hotel so although I didn't expect anything really flashy I did expect a comfort and level of service worthy of a professional hotel.  I booked on Tuesday 03 October and we stayed last night.  The hotel boasts the following facilities amongst others: Satellite TV/ In-House Movies  If you try to watch anything other than the terrestrial channels it asks you to insert your Sky Card. Room service (24 hours)  However, I have no idea what room service was offering since there was no menu in our room, or mention of room service facilitiesWake Up Service  Only if you ask for it  it wasnt offered.Health Club  No idea where this was  again nothing in the room to indicate where you were supposed to go.Hotel Parking  If you delve a bit deeper this is advertised as Private Parking - This is my main reason for complaint. As stated when I made my reservation we needed a late check in. So as it was Central London I deliberately opted for a hotel with parking. In fact, upon arrival we were told there is free parking in the street outside until 8:30am. You cant park in our car park it is closed! I found this a bizarre situation and complained that the street outside was completely full and we needed to park, we had stated we would be late arriving  had nobody thought it a good idea to contact us and tell us the situation with parking. The aggressive, rude receptionist then told me that he would take me to the car park and arrange to get our car in  it would cost 30.00, at the Holiday Inn across the road! I had assumed that as the details on the website said that there was hotel parking, and didnt note an additional charge that it was free onsite parking. He then went on in pigeon English to try to explain the concept of Inclusive versus Exclusive to me; which frankly by this time I was in no mood to hear and it bears no relevance to the circumstances. I am extremely angry that we were duped in this way  faced with Hobsons choice; wait for a parking space outside and move early in the morning, pay 30.00 to park in another hotels car park or go elsewhere and forfeit 135.00 for a room you dont use. We were lucky a parking space became free but it did mean we had to leave earlier than we needed to this morning. Breakfast - A continental breakfast was supposed to be served this morning; it consisted of small boxes of cereal and toast, little pots of jam and slices of processed cheese still in their individual plastic wrappers.  According to the website you can have breakfast to go but when you ask for it your toast is handed to you in a scrunched up serviette and you have to fill your pockets with the jam. No orange juice or water is given to you  just a handful of toast!  Hardly a three star menu or the superior service promised. There was a nice little balcony outside our window; used to house the green floodlights that lit the front of the building  and our room. I finally managed to drift off to sleep around 6:30am when they went off!  Without a shadow of a doubt we will remember our stay at the Abcone for many years to come. I hope this feedback is of some use to you.Although this review did appear on the Late Rooms website for a very short time it quickly disappeared!"
28,496,"Nov 4 2007	Quite adequate	The Abcone Hotel is situated in Kensington, a nice area of London, close to Gloucester Rd tube station, a nice variety of eateries, supermarkets, Royal Albert Hall, Hyde Park and the Natural History, Science and V&amp;A museums,We had a double room which was nothing fancy but quite adequate for the time we spent there. The bathroom was clean though very small. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels and tea/coffee delivered daily. There was a small fridge with drinks. We didn't partake so can't say how expensive they were.In the mild October we had, it was necessary to keep windows open during the day. It was okay to close them at night without overheating. As a light sleeper, I was relieved the hotel was located at the quiet end of the street away from noisy Cromwell Rd and that we were not bothered by noise in the hotel itself.The biggest disappointment was the &quot;organic&quot; breakfast. A small selection of cereals, processed sliced pan toasted and cheese slices in individual wrappers are hardly organic or even acceptable as a selection for breakfast. The serving staff were busy and rather sullen and annoyingly wearing high heels on wooden floors. One busy morning (about 14-18 people) we arrived for breakfast and while we found seats ok, we were told there were no cups or cutlery left! We were left to scavenge some unused ourselves from uncleared tables. Cooked breakfasts were available for an extra charge.When we visited much of the paintwork in our room was chipped and the TV had a fault which meant it switched off then on again every five minutes or so. The reception staff weren't terribly friendly. On some websites, I notice it says you can check in here at 11am. We tried to but were told it would be 2pm at least..We were able to leave our bags though before check-in and also after check-out which was good. We tend to magnify the bits that annoy us but, on the whole, we were reasonably content with the hotel especially the location. We were out most of the day so, apart from the disappointing breakfasts, it was fine for our purposes for a couple of days sightseeing. We were on a tight budget and our deal worked out about 80 or so a night but I wouldn't like to pay more for what we actually got."
29,496,"Oct 30 2007	OK For A Night	Chose this hotel as attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Walking time to the RAH is around 20 minutes so it is convenient for that.The Abcone is a clean well maintained hotel which served the purpose quite well. I had a single room which was very hot, even with the window open and the bathroom was the smallest I have ever come across. Fat people could not use the toilet or the shower. I found I could not sleep because of the heat and the heating was turned off and window was open. Noise from outside the hotel was also a big problem at night.The breakfast is very basic, cereals and orange juice and toast with processed cheese. I am sure they could do better here.Reception staff were unable to help with basic questions, he had never heard of the Albert Hall. Next day there was a girl on reception who could not tell me how to get to Chelsea. My son also stayed in a single room which was more spacious and had a much bigger shower room so it is the luck of the draw with which room you are given.I would consider this hotel again for a one night stay but would want a different room."
30,496,"Oct 26 2007 	pretty good	we stayed in the Abcone after a show at the Albert Hall and location is great for that - about 10 mins walk max. the reception staff were friendly and helpful - they let us in the room way before the check in time . the room was spacious and spotless with a decent shower. nice and quiet in a fairly residential area but near bars/restaurants for a night out. but the breakfast really let it down, a couple of sullen waitresses who half cooked the toast and that was pretty much all there was on offer except cereal - i had to go in the kitchen and ask if i could have tea as only coffee was out on the 'buffet' table and the staff were pretty indifferent (not sure you could really call it a buffet continental breakfast - think they were being a bit liberal with the truth there) but overall not bad value for the money"
31,496,"Oct 16 2007 	Perfect and quaint in the heart of Kensington!!	I was spending the summer in the UK, but the first week I needed a place in London by myself. Being very familiar with the Kensington area, I wanted to stay there so I wouldn't have to do too much searching upon my arrival. Those of you who know Kensington will know that it is one of the more expensive areas of London!! Well I lucked out...the Abcone had excellent rates. When I arrived, the reception was excellent, although I laughed when I went into my room - it was the tiniest room I had ever seen!! That said, everything was so well fitted/organized, that it was perfect for one person. The bed was comfortable, there was tv and all amenities, the bathroom basic but clean and the daily service kept the room spotless. Breakfast was included and was a nice selection of cereals, breads, fruits, etc. It was VERY hot that week, but they provided a fan and that plus the open window helped. The only downside was that they had no ice machines, but the kitchen staff were kind enough to bring me a big bowl of ice each night after a long day in the city.I did not see any other rooms, but I'd highly recommend this hotel for single travelers who want something nicer than a hostel. This hotel is on a quiet street just a couple blocks from Gloucester Road Tube on the Picadilly Line. Close to a grocery store, 24 hr stores, starbucks, restaurants, Natural History Museum and more! :)"
32,496,"Oct 5 2007	what a rip off!	This is such an expensive hotel for what it is providing! paid 300 for three nights stay when its only worth half the price! this is purely a rip off. Silly of me to book direct through the property but even then its not decent to charge in such extreme.what a start of my europe trip, to feel so rip off! breakfast is not visiting. better to get it off gloucester road. just don bother with this place."
33,496,"Oct 1 2007 	Handy location - quiet	Was situated in a really quiet area, but only a quick walk to tube, pub, cafes and shops. Hotel was a bit dated but very clean. We had breakfast in the hotel the first day but it was only mediocre so went out after that as Cafe Paul was only down the road and really good. The price was the clincher for this hotel. Best value as London can be so expensive, all we wanted was a nice, clean room that we'd be able to have a good night's sleep and not be ripped off. That's what we got."
34,496,"Sep 30 2007 	average	Stayed here for 8 nights. Great location for London base. Short walk to underground Gloucester station &amp; top cafe for breakfast. The room was very small, not even enough room to lie our suitcases on the floor. The drain in the shower did not drain away. The bathroom was a good size. Luckily there was a fan provided in the room which we had turned on at all times. We had an opening window but it was still quite hot inside. The room was fairly clean &amp; was kept stocked with tea/coffee supplies. NB this hotel even provided &quot;real coffee&quot; &amp; perculator machine! We had a small bar fridge which was great for keeping up the food supplies. Didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but it was advertised for a very reasonable price by London standards. Plenty of shops including supermarket &amp; restaurants nearby so you won't go hungry. The hotel was very quiet &amp; located directly across the road from a major hotel chain hotel. All in all a pretty average hotel but ideally located &amp; close to transport."
35,496,"Sep 24 2007 	nice hotel	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, reception staff friendly and helpful, room was plenty big enough,( we have had much smaller both in London and other areas ) nice comfortable bed, tv, tea coffee making facilities plus a mini fridge ( which they will keep topped up with cold drinks at an extra charge if required ), carpets had small stains, but this is due to negligent guests spilling things rather than any fault of the hotel, towels changed daily, tea, coffee, milk, soap and shampoo replaced on a daily basis, walking distance to the museums, harrods, gloucester tube couple mins away, dont know what breakfast was like as we took the opportunity over the weekend to have a lie in, rather than get up for breakfast ! On the day of departure, they look after your luggage free of charge which was a big help as we were travelling late at night so still had the day free to go sightseeing. Overall, we had a very comfortable stay, and will definately book this hotel again next year."
36,496,"Sep 16 2007 	Basic but good value	If you only need a clean bed for the night in central london and don't require all the expensive extras, then The Abcone Hotel can be ideal. Reception was efficient. My single room was on the top floor. It was tiny but I was only in it a few hours to sleep. (watch out for the window opening wide if you have kids). It was quiet and the bed was fine. The shower was OK but the sink tap water wouldn't run cold. Continental breakfast (cereal, toast, juice and coffee) was all I needed. Cooked breakfast available at 3.95 extra. Overall good value at 55 by London standards for a clean room in Kensington, only 100m from Gloucester Road tube station."
37,496,"Sep 8 2007 	Perfectly adequate	I was pleasantly surprised! Very much booked to a budget for 3 nights and concerned after what I had got for a similar price in Earls Court 2 years ago but it was fine.Yes the room is small, but they do come smaller! It was clean, newish furniture with a comfortable bed, sparkling bathroom. A perfectly good place to sleep: who wants to spend the day in their hotel room in London? Niggles: The water refuses to run cold so drinking water has to go via the fridge, the carpet had seen better days, the breakfast was basic but what do you expect at this price point? Reception staff were helpful and stored a huge sports bag for me whilst I travelled elsewhere for a reasonable charge and nil once we had booked in. Literally 2 minutes walk to the 'tube'and direct to Heathrow Airport, so an excellent location just a few stops from the West End.I would stay there again and pocket the savings to spend elsewhere in London."
38,496,"Aug 7 2007 	great value	Great location, fantastic price, clean, fan in room..really handy! Would use again, breakfast ok."
39,496,Jul 3 2007 	Good for Olympia	Good location near tube station and handy for exhibitions. Clean and friendly. Very good value breakfast - only 2.95 for continental or 3.95 for English! Nearby Waitrose for drinks etc. and lots of restaurants nearby. Quiet location for London.
40,496,"Apr 30 2007 	Disappointed	Don't believe the size of the room from the pictures they show you. My husband and I could barely move around each other in the tiny room we were given. Carpet was absolutely filthy and they didn't even vacuum every day. Bathroom, while small, was modern and the shower was hot and strong but tile grout was beginning to mold and mildew. Could hardly get down the very narrow hallways for the linens laying on the floor every day.On a positive note, the staff was friendly but not too knowledable about the city and the extra pillows I requested arrived immediately. Furniture was clean and modern and had a nice wardrobe for clothing. Excellent location and neighborhood. Glouster Road tube station is 2 blooks away and good choice of inexpensive (if anything in London can be called that) restaurants in the neighborhood. Grocery store also very close.I would not stay there again."
41,496,Apr 10 2007	cold showers not part of the plan	well located hotel BUTasked for a non-smoking room and it was not forthcomingbreakfast was until 9:30 - when arriving at 9:15 told that cooked breakfast was off and offered toast with an attitude instead on last morning there was only cold water in the shower which topped off a relatively unplesant stayas there are many hotels in this central area i would recommend staying elsewhere
42,496,"Mar 27 2007 	Hidden gem in South Kensington	My wife and I recently spent a wonderful 6 days at the Abcone Hotel. We had arrived at 8:30 AM after an overnight flight from San Francisco. Our room wasn't ready ( as expected) but they said they would have it ready as soon as they could. After going to breakfast, we returned at 10:30 AM. We were then told our room was now ready and that we were welcome to check in early. This was very nice of them as we were quite tired.The rest of our stay was great, and everyone was always more than helpful. Any requests were taken care of right away ( extra pillows, ice, etc.) The room was clean, though much smaller than most rooms here in the States. But we knew that going in so we weren't surprised. Having visited London one time a few years back, I wanted to stay in South Kensington, and this stay at the Abcone was all I could have hoped for. I just hope that with too many good reviews, they don't raise their prices! London's not cheap!"
43,496,"Mar 24 2007 	Excellent!	This hotel is the best budget hotel that I have ever stayed at in London.... and I have stayed in a lot!The hotel is 30 minutes exactly from heathrow international terminal 3 with no line changes!The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly! Funny too!The price was fabulous for London. 89 GBP per night for a very spacious family room ( we were 3 adults, 1 four- year old).. 2 twins and a king bed with a remarkably clean spacious bathroom. Loads of wardrobe space and a huge window with a private balcony. Great continental breakfast, very clean and quiet.Also, they have internet access in the lobby for a very good deal.Very quiet and 2 blocks easy walk to the Glouchester road tube station, a really safe residential neighborhood with a boots drugstore, waitrose market, pubs and the like all within a block. we walked to chelsea and V &amp; A museum in 20 minutes, easy walk.I will definitely return and tell everyone I know about this fine hotel.Stay at The Abcone! You will not be sorry!"
44,496,"Feb 7 2007	very nice stay	I am an Italian teacher (evening classes) and I stayed at the Abcone Hotel from the 2nd to the 6th of February with a group of 15 adult students. I had booked after browsing the internet site of the hotel and reading some reviews of previous guests on tripadvisor. I didn't expect to find such a nice hotel. The staff are very friendly and helped the group when they were in trouble (for instance with the room key), everybody was satisfied with their room and their breakfast. The hotel is quite modern and in a very quiet area of London, if you need to eat something quick and cheap there are several places nearby where you can enjoy a meal and the most important thing when you need to visit the town - the tube station is really 10-minute walk from the hotel. The price for the group was really cheap. I am recommending the hotel to my friends and I'll be back on my next visit to London."
45,496,"Jan 17 2007 	Unwelcoming and Cramped? Tell Me About It!	Only stayed for one night, and to call it cramped and dirty, would be an understatement. The bedroom window looked as though the glass would fall out with a gentle breeze. A pane appeared to be glued together. There was no hot water in the bathroom, and you had to practically sit on the toilet when you wanted to use the basin.The bed was a mere 6&quot; from the wall at the base, which meant clambering over the bed to reach the far side.Unfortunately we missed breakfast (due to a missunderstading at check in) Reception were very blunt and said &quot;I told you breakfast finished at 9.30&quot;.......No offer of a bowl of cereal, cup of coffee or even a fruit juice! There was a workman sat at the reception desk chatting (no work going on in the hotel?) and he had a cup of coffee???? The hallway floors were covered in clean sheets and towels for the 24 hours we were there! I truly feel they took our money under false pretences. Right is right and wrong is wrong and this was definately very wrong. Hope they are happy with our well earned money."
46,496,"Dec 22 2006 	Most Excellent Value	I stayed at the Abcone for 3 days in November/December 2006. I found it to be quite clean and modern, and in a most excellent location - 2 blocks from the Gloucester station. The room was small, but to be expected in Central London for the price. There is internet available at the hotel, but there is a much cheaper option right across from the tube station. The only issue that I experienced was that my key didn't work at first -I was quite tired when I checked in and my key didn't work the first time, or the second, but the third they got it right. Small price to pay I believe. Also, local calls are charged by the minute - so beware. Good eats nearby if you want something quick. Close to a post office which was quite nice. I would definitely stay here again. Not recommended for those who spend a lot of time in their hotel rooms as they are smaller than what the average American is accustomed to. But housekeeping was efficient and the bathrooms clean and modern."
47,496,"Sep 29 2006 	Do Not Stay	Carpet Was Filthy, Bathroom ceiling leaked water, Two twin mattresses pushed together to make double bed, Small room, Had to walk sideways to get into small bathroom."
48,496,"Sep 26 2006 	Good budget priced hotel	Having read previous reviews of Abcone Hotel was dreading our stay. The hotel was well presented, the hotel staff were helpful and our room was faultless. We had a spacious room, lovely decor, well fitted out and equipped with hot drink facilities, hairdryer and a fan. The bathroom was tiled floor to ceiling in marble .The only drawback, if there was any, was that the breakfast was fairly basic, cereal and toast, but hey thats all you have at home. Would recommend as a good budget priced hotel in a lovely position in Kensington.Ione and Steve Gibbons, Saddleworth UK"
49,496,"Sep 19 2006 	Hard to Enjoy	Just back from two-night (personal funds) weekend stay, following three previous days in business class hotel. I regret paying the 65 pounds/night (for regular single), as the value proposition at even that level was minimal. Stiflying hot third floor room (while outdoor temp were friendly low 20s), no a/c, disgusting cheap mattress with no padding/cover against its annoying buttons and threadbare sheets, &quot;organic&quot; breakfast of Kelloggs boxed cereal, toast and bland coffee... Save your money."
50,496,"Jul 5 2006	Great Value!	I am an American living in the UK and travel to London quite alot, every hotel has been cramped and dated. I had a friend and her young daughter visit from the US and we stayed in the Abcore Hotel for 3 nights. It was wonderful, what a change from all the tiny budget hotels in London! We booked the family deluxe room at an unbeatable price of 285 a night, thats half the price it would have cost for 2 rooms anywhere else. Our room had 2 single beds and one double bed, we also had a cot in our room for an infant, with plenty of room to spare for luggage and space for the kids to run around at the end of a long day. Only room we could find like this, 3 adults and 2 kids comfortable in one room! Absolutley could not believe how big the room was, especially in London. Location was great too, short walk from Glouester Road tube station which is on the Circle and District line so its extremely easy to get to where you want to go. Quiet street, we had the windows open at night. Friendly staff, we arrived well before check in and were told as our room had been empty the night before we could go ahead and put our bags in our room. Didnt sample the breakfast as we were up and out too early in the morning. Only complaint would only be our problems with booking, you will only have this problem if using a Switch/Maestro card. As they have no way to validate the card unless they charge you for 1/2 one nights stay and then credit it back to your acct. But staff was very friendly and happy to help. I would reccommend this hotel to families or groups that dont want/cant afford 2 rooms at a time. Very impressed, already planning to go back!"
51,496,"May 31 2006	A great hotel choice	My mom and I just returned from a trip to London where we stayed at the Abcone, and we really liked it. After five visits to London, it's the best budget hotel I've stayed at. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. We arrived too early to get into our room, so they stored our luggage in the back room while we went to the museums just down the street, and when we returned, our luggage had been put in our room for us. The room was a good size, clean, bright and attractive, and it had a proper bathroom with a real bathtub, not one of those airline capsule type bathrooms a lot of British hotels have. A kettle with tea &amp; coffee supplies was provided, as well as a hairdrier and a small fridge with an honor mini-bar. And they have an elevator, which is rather rare in a budget hotel in London. In a great location near the Underground, buses, shops &amp; restaruants, but located on a side street so it was mostly quiet even with the window open. Our view was a tree filled park across the street. Within walking distance of the V&amp;A and Natural History Museuems.We did not experience the water temperature problems that some other reviewrs have mentioned, but I can see where those spigots might be somewhat confusing to people accustomed to straightforward American water faucents. Also, those visiting the U.K. for the first time must realize that things are just smaller there - the hotel rooms, the elevators, corridor width etc. - and this does not make the place a bad hotel. Our room at the Abcone (which was a twin, with two single beds) was actually a pretty good size compared to places I've stayed on previous trips.I can fnd only two little things that were not so great - one being the continental breakfast included with the room price, which consisted of merely cold cereal and cold toast. After the first day, we went down the street to Waitrose and got packaged muffins and fruit and had them with tea in our room. Also, they charged 3 for interent access in the lobby. I went around the corner to an internet cafe and paid only 80 pence for a half hour on line. However they only charged 25 pence for a local phone call made from our room.Over all, I found the Abcone to have been a great choice for our visit to London and I'd definitely stay there again."
52,496,"May 27 2006	Not as bad as reviews might lead	I recently stayed at the Abcone Hotel for 2 nights. I was in a group of four people so we got 2 rooms. My room was one of the basement rooms. It was small, but not that bad. The bathroom was nice, and there was plenty of hot water. The other room was upstairs and was smaller than mine, but similar in condition. The beds were only ok, a little hard for my liking. The self serve breakfast for 3 pounds was pretty good and consisted of toast, cereal, juice, coffee, tea, etc. (I did not try the full English breakfast). The staff was friendly enough, although they did try and charge us for a few extra breakfast's, so beware. Overall, I would say the hotel was fine for what we paid. It is in a good location, 2 blocks from the Gloucester Road tube station, and in a good neighborhood. That said, I would most likely not stay there again, as on the end of our trip we stayed in a much nicer hotel, for not much more money (see best western mostyn)."
53,496,"Mar 24 2006	Worried but positively surprised	After having read some of the reviews here at Tripadvisor I kind of regretted that I had booked a stay at Abcone Hotel. We arrived very late a Friday night and were kind of expecting the worstLuckily we had booked a deluxe room which was tiny for being such a room however spotless and very clean - even the bathroom was sparkling. Nothing to complain about when it comes to cleanliness and the beds were also very comfortable.Most of the complaints here at Tripadvisor are referring to the size of the room but you simply cant compare a Victorian building in central London with a modern hotel anywhere in the world; Victorian hotels usually have small rooms.I find Abcone well suited for a weekend-trip to London but if youre carrying tons of luggage and are in need of loads of space I would recommend you to stay somewhere else. Personally I would stay here again if the price is right./Peter, Stockholm, Sweden"
54,496,"Feb 22 2006	Dishonest	Overall the hotel was clean and is in a good location. What you would expect for the reasonable price. But, I will never stay there again and for one reason. They are dishonest. We checked out of our room and the man proceeded to tell us we owed almost 80 pounds for telephone and mini bar use. We never touched the mini bar - not once. We did use the phone but checked out our calling cards with TWO front desk staff to make sure they were free to call out. The front desk attendent told us that there was nothing he could do and offered to take 25 pounds in cash and wipe the record clean. I refused this - there is no record of cash transactions! Plus, we did not use any of the services we were being charged for. He was rude, telling us to be more careful next time! It was an awful experience and I would hate for anyone else to have these same mystery charges on check out."
55,496,"Dec 28 2005	AWFUL! No cold running water.	Don't stay at this hotel! There was no cold water for 3 days in a row, only very very hot. Had to wash my face with a bottle of mineral water. The elevator was broken for those 3 days. I laughed out loud when i saw the size of my room. It was a bed, a wardrobe and a desk crammed into a closet-sized room. On the up- side the price was good - 2 nights for a single room was 90. But only go to the Abcone if you are really stuck!!"
56,496,"Nov 16 2005	Never Never Stay There	My friends and I stayed at the Abcone Hotel at the end of October and had NO COLD WATER throughout the trip, the carpeting in the room was dirty and a dead fly was found on the floor on the first day (albeit this was gone when the room was cleaned). The first room we were shown to wasn't big enough to get the three of us in with our suitcases, the second room, though larger, still had very small beds and the third one was a sofa bed (which I had agreed with staff we would not have before arriving). The staff were very unhelpful and on trying to get compensation from the Manager, he accused me of having too much complaints to be genuine, COLD WATER isn't a complaint, it's a necessity!!!! I also had the same problem as a previous complainer with the taxi I ordered, a private taxi was called when I asked for a black cab. I would never stay at the Abcone Hotel again."
57,496,"Jun 6 2005	Quiet Location but Manager Standards Are a Problem	Hotel is located in a quiet and pleasant neighborhood, near public transportation. During our two stays we were in 3 different rooms. They were all clean and quiet and the bathrooms were well maintained. The continental breakfast, however, was the poorest quality of any hotel on our trip.We had 2 problems during our stays. First, one room was over the boiler room and very hot all the time. Something malfunctioned with the water system and all cold water faucets delivered scalding hot water--even the toilet tank filled with hot water. The staff could not seem to get the problem fixed, and only after we insisted on another room did they move us.The second problem is that when we asked the desk to call us a taxi, they called instead a private driver and didn't tell us. The driver charged quite a bit more than a taxi would have, and the driver admitted that he paid a commission to the hotel manager for each customer the hotel provided. So if you want a taxi, you'd better get your own so you won't be tricked like we were."
58,496,Mar 24 2005	Adequate	We stayed in this hotel only one night and found it to be small but adequate. The hotel is about a block from a main street so it was quiet while still being close to restaurants and stores.
59,496,"Mar 22 2005	Pity about the staff	Hotel itself is in a good location and the room was fine, albeit slightly noisy as it was directly opposite reception on the ground floor.The main problem with the Abcone is the lack of courtesy shown by the staff and management. We requested an alternative room and were told that there was no alternative available, which was directly contradictory to advice given to colleagues who were moved from a room in the basement (which was also very noisy).Rooms were very clean and tidy and bathroom equally suitableBreakfast was dreadfull. the breakfast provided with the room was continental (which consisted of cereal and toast) - price if not included in the room 2.95. This can be upgraded to full english breakfast which is 3.95, but best avoided (this was cooked in the microwave, with the exception of the beans that they forgot to cook and were provided cold!. Naturally we assumed the charge for this would be the additional 1, but my credit card statement showed a different picture when the hotel charged the full amount to my card without informing me. I have since raised this with the manager of the hotel who made it quite clear that he was not concerned with my complaint on the basis that &quot;there are plenty more customers out there&quot;.Overall, fine looking hotel with potential, but very badly managed and my final word...watch your credit card statement carefully!"
60,496,"Feb 24 2005	Good Stay	We stayed at the Abcone Hotel for four (4) nights, mid January 2005. Our stay there was quite enjoyable.The location is great! They're only two blocks from the Glouster Road tube station, which proved to be very convenient.The hotel staff was friendly and pleasant. Our room was located on the fourth floor, and was of average size for this class hotel. The room was small, but not smaller than I've found at other hotels in the city. We found the room neat and tidy. The bathroom was updated, modern, and very clean. On a whole, the room was basic if not utilitarian, but met our needs. My only complaint in the room (which is not major) would be that the carpeting should be replaced. It was stained, but clearly had been vacuumed. I found the Abcone hotel a good value for the money."
61,496,"Jan 3 2005	Hated the room	We booked a room at the Abcone Hotel in London for 30th Dec '04.We were given a room in the basement. The carpet had filthy black stains all over it.The room was so tiny, it failed to represent any of the advertisements we saw on the rooms. Plumbing pipes banged loudly all night, without relenting. Persons working for the hotel shouted arguments until midnight, we presume they were in the only other room in the basement on the other side of the linen cupboards. If this is the type of room one is given for booking over the internet, do not bother."
62,496,"Dec 5 2004	Great Value in Fabulous Location	This is a lovely 3 star with comfortable, well-kept rooms. Rooms aren't huge but fine by European standards, especially if you get a deluxe room. Bathrooms are all marble and sparkling clean, but cold water seemed to be in short supply, which really means there was never a problem getting a hot shower!! The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. Great location with Glouster Street tube station, two supermarkets, restaurants, and a Starbucks just around the corner. It might not be a great place to stay in the summer as there is no AC and the rooms can get quite warm."
63,496,"Dec 1 2004	horrible experience	i found mold in a picture frame, which i am alergic to, the cold water in the bathroom never appeared, the shower was broken, the room was extremely hot, with no way to turn down the heat and the breakfast was a fraud. The employees didn't know how to treat a customer , there was stains on the rug, dirty sheets and a very uncomfortable bed tht left a small cut on my knee, also when i went to the desk to complain about these problems, the staff simply said, ok and im sorry about that...."
64,496,"Oct 27 2004	Lovely hotel gonna stay here again!	We were three adults friends travelling together.We paid 88  for a three beded room, with a bathroom, which was recently upgraded, and had a standard of a lux hotel (and i have stayed in a few!)Had NO problem with the shower and hot water, even though we got up late in the &quot;morning&quot;, three girls taking long showers and the hotel was fully booked! (Maybe people need to find out how to regulate the water temp :-) )The room was okay, with a coffee maker, refrig. and a hairdryer. Good sized wardrobe!We will stay here when we go back in the spring!"
65,496,"Aug 4 2004	Never never stay at Abcone Hotel	Never, never choose this hotel if it appear on your search!!! My room was ridicusly small, the cold water in the bathroom never appeared, the shower was broken, the room was extremely hot and without air conditioning, the lift simply didn't work at all, and the breakfast was a fraud. The employees didn't know how to treat turists, I felt like they want to charge every single thing on your bill. Really an unpleasant stay. I do not recommend it."

I have to say I have stayed in many hotels in London for various occasions and this hotel was really good. The staff are friendly and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. I would reccomend it and use the albion when I next visit London."
2,503,"Oct 26 2009 	Compact clean and very friendly	We enjoyed our stay at Albion House, this is the second time we have been. The room was small, however it had everything we could want, and was very clean. It is in a very quiet and convenient area near Kings Cross station. The staff are friendly and we would certainly go back again."
3,503,Oct 21 2009 	Excellent business or personal travellers hotel	The Albion is wonderfully clean and the rooms are all brightly decorated and modern with very clean en suite facilities.The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the locaton is ideal for getting around al areas of London.It really is excellent value for money.
4,503,"Oct 21 2009 	Great quality for a reasonable price	I have been staying in the hotel regularly as of May 2009. All I can say is - great quality for reasonable price, polite and helpful staff and superb location. My colleagues from our office in abroad are also always staying in Albion House Hotel when in London. The location is absolutely great - centrally based, not far away from main attractions. Great transport links as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel to people, who expect great service in a cosy hotel for a good price."
5,503,"Oct 20 2009 	Clean Close and Comfort! Value for money!	Close to Kings Cross (tube/bus/rail), friendly staff, the rooms are clean, OK breakfast, very good location, comfortable beds! Perfect stay for those who don't need a big lobby, mini bar etc Very close to all lines in London Underground. Nice park area. Central located, but quiet area."
6,503,"Oct 15 2009 	Great location great value	Recently stayed at the Albion and just had to give it a reveiw after seeing some of the negitive comments. I shared a room with some friends on a girly weekend and we were very happy with the hotel. The room was clean, we had comfy beds and a modern fitted bathroom. It had all the essential bits in the room and the staff were really nice.For a very central base in London thats good value for money, it gets my thumbs up."
7,503,"Oct 14 2009 	Very pleased	I stayed with my wife and our young son we had a triple room which was a nice size and accomadated our needs very well, ground floor so was easy access esp with a small child and luggage, tv,towels,tea coffee facillites all supplied too, frindly staff and a great location for a short family break"
8,503,"Oct 14 2009 	Happy	I stayed here at the Albion House Hotel for 3 Nights for business I am was very happy with my stay, nice sized room clean and tidy and all the pieces I needed ie tea coffee, towels hairdyer, also TV with free view which was great, also was able to work from my room in the evenings as there is free wi-fi connection which was even better would be very happy to stay again either for business or personal"
9,503,Oct 14 2009 	A top stay in a top place in a top town!	The Albion House is the perfect place to stay for a trip to London. It's 30 seconds walk from Kings Cross/St. Pancras and only 5 minutes from Euston station. Central London is all on your doorstep. We didn't need to take a taxi all weekend!
10,503,"Oct 12 2009 	one of the best B	i've stayed there because it is very closed from the rail international station , St. Pancras. Once, the area was not really good and clean, but nowadays seems is changed due to the new station. Under my opinion Albion is the best bed and breakfast in the area.. considering London budget hotels are not really good comparing with other countries.I didn't expect the bed was so comfortable for what I paid... The room was also quite modern, maybe the bathroom was the oldest thing in there. Breakfast quite limited choice, but is normal being a B&amp;B...I reccomend it to everybody who's going to London for short period of time."
11,503,"Jul 22 2009 	Shabby but not chic!	Stayed at The Albion House Hotel for 1 night in July. We were a group of 3 female friends, we had booked a triple room several months in advance, and followed it up since then with several phone calls - including one on the day of arrival - to check the booking was still OK. Arrived at the end of an evening out to check in as arranged, and were given 1 &quot;double&quot; and 1 single room by a very rude night receptionist, meaning (a) we were separated (something we'd gone to great lengths to avoid as it was a kind of reunion night out) and (b) 2 of us had to share a very small double bed. Rooms were at the top of the house and very hot, bathrooms grubby, and the towels were a joke. My bath towel was a small, ancient, well worn towel absolutely full of holes! Needless to say we did not stay for breakfast in the morning. Put our complaints to the person on duty in the morning who pleaded ignorance and said we'd have to email the manager, who has not responded to any of these issues. Avoid!"
12,503,"Jul 6 2009	Average/Acceptable barely	We stayed in 3 hotels on Argyle Square, and this one was the best of the bunch. Very small bathroom, but heated towel rack. Nicely decorated, although very small. Did not have a front desk - you must go to their companion hotel a minute walk away. Considering the area, didn't feel very secure that there was no one &quot;on duty.&quot; Breakfast was simply toast and tea. Would stay here again, if we had to, but wouldn't be thrilled."
13,503,"Jun 19 2009 	That was not a room it was a closet!	Before we traveled I read some of the reviews, and took my chances, and it was all they said and more!The check-in was in diferent hotel, when we arrived a no talking man, made us pay first, and only after it, he gave us a room key for the Excelsior Hotel, not for the Albion House.Our room was on the ground floor, and it was so small, that i cant really descrive! I can only say that before I get out the bathroom i have to knock on the door and my boyfriend needed to get up on the bed, so I can get out! The breakfast was in Albion, so we needed to go outside, and it was only tea, coffee and toast.It was not a pleasant stay."
14,503,"Jun 17 2009 	Not as bad as we thought	After reading reviews on here we were very apprehensive about what we found here even had a look elsewhere but for the price and location we couldnt find anything. Location was great for St Pancreas and Kings Cross. We had to check in a the Melville which was accross the square this one didnt look as nice, we nearly we seperated as we had three rooms but we all got in the Albion. The Albion hotel was clean tidy , suprising how what you can get in such a small space ie bathroom shower, toilet and some have a sink in the bathroom the size of a wardrobe. Bu the overall thing that let this place down would be the breakfast which was included but might aswell not have been as it was a joke, choice of 2 cereals, chesse slice, hard boiled egg and white toast!!! So overall somewhere to put your head down alright."
15,503,"May 11 2009 	Dont go here	Have to check in at a different hotel down the road which is no problem and the woman was helpful.Rooms were ok......and thats the best bit!! Beds were uncomfortable but at least clean. Carpets were worn and dirty, kettle did not work, towels were old and frayed. I did not expect too much before my visit but did expect cleanliness.Service was non existent. Had to wait 15 mins to get a seat for Breakfast (room holds about 10 people). Then had to wait another 10 mins for our dirty table to be cleaned and new cutlery etc. Went to get some cereal but there was none left! (This was 8.45 in the morning and Breakfast only opens at 8). When I asked for some the lady did not understand me as she did not speak much English!! Eventually got some toast after another 10 mins but there was nothing to put on it! I asked the lady for some butter and jam. She came back with 2 satchets of Strawberry jam but not butter. I went back to her and asked for some butter or marg but they had none!! So, the choice for Breakfast was cereal, which they had none or toast, which they had no spread. Walked out and packed and then went back to other hotel to check out and complain. I asked for my money for Breakfast back and explained the reason. How bizarre, the lady that had checked us in the previous day had lost the ability to converse in English and kept saying she did not understand!! By this time I had given up and just left.......never to return!!"
16,503,"Mar 2 2009 	Value for Money in the heart of London	Clean and friendlly, spotless room (recently refurbished), ideal location close to St Pancras and Kings Cross, beside UCL. Check in in Melville Hotel, room in Imperial, brekfeast in Albion House, who cares, at the rates we paid this was excelllent value.Friendly receptionist, good brekfeast, all buildings within thirty paces of each other. Held our cases until 7pm on departure date."
17,503,"Jan 20 2009 	Great Location but not up to standards	I stayed in this hotel for a few days when traveling on business. I have not stayed in hotels in this area before, but reading the reviews here I thought it might be a good place to stay - very good price and advertised to offer modern traveler standards for business and leisure travelers.The hotel is quite modern inside and quite nice. The room was of adequate size for a solo traveler although the bathroom was indeed extremely tiny. Be aware though that the beds are extremely small - a double bed is the size of a single bed in other hotels. The breakfast was good, nothing luxurious, but for the price range 50-60 GBP it being included in the price of the room, cannot complain at all.What I did not like and what ruined the whole experience for me with this hotel in a way that I cannot recommend it to anyone who is even a bit concerned with cleanliness and standards is the room cleaning. I can be fully sure the linen was not changed and it was very easy to see that the pillowcase was not changed at all during the several days I stayed there. Adding to this - the hotel only provides one towel (not separate towels for hands and body). What's ultimately worse - they did not change the towel - so think about having to use one towel for your whole body for several days! Having stayed in a number of hotels in the past - this is the worst experience of this kind. When I asked for an extra towel I got one that smelled bad and was not obviously clean - I stopped trying further at that point. I can not recommend this hotel to anyone caring even a little bit about hygiene. It is such a shame that these sort of simple things completely ruined the experience of staying in an otherwise nice hotel."
18,503,"Aug 18 2008 	Good place  good location...nice people !	I stay in London B&amp;Bs quite often due to work comitments , which means i need a place : clean and conmfortable room for 3 nights per week.I only discovered the Albion a few months ago , and have been staying there ever since. A colleague told me about it and i decided to take his advise .....I ve stayed in a few places in the area , and the Albion seems to be the best by some distance. The rooms are a good enough size but more importantly they are clean and bright and excellent value for money in Central London.60 per night for a single room is pretty good.The staff are always helpful and look after when im there.I do recomend this place to business travelers."
19,503,"Apr 6 2008 	Dont think about going there.	We had two family rooms ,one was on the fourth floor and the other was in the basement.You have to climb narrow stairs so its difficult if you have any large luggage.Both rooms had a bad smell,and the shower room was so small the wash basin had to be located in the bedroom.The Continental Breakfast was the worst hotel breakfast that we have ever had. None of the staff were very good with speaking English.The only good thing is that the room had been decorated but it did not stop the bad smell."
20,503,"Mar 13 2008	Great Service	Great service and very cosy rooms at a great priceParth Parmar, Leicestershire"
21,503,Mar 7 2008 	Great Customer Service	The staff was very accommodating. We had to arrive a day early and they were very nice and helpful. The hotel was clean and the breakfast was great. I would highly recommend this hotel to travelers!
22,503,"Feb 10 2008 	Some other place next time	I stayed at the Albion House Hotel last June for four nights. It was okay to sleep there, but only to sleep. The rooms have no aircondition, which is a huge disadvantage when it is about 25C outside. There was also only one towel in my room as it was a single room so I had to organise another one at the Melville Hotel. If I wanted to take a shower I always had to &quot;evacuate&quot; the toilet paper first or it would have been drenched. The room itself was very small and the bed was very narrow, so I had to take care to not fall out of the bed when I turned at night.Another disadvantage of the hotel: It has no lift, so be prepared to carry your luggage upstairs.The manager was not friendly at all, but the room-maid and the guy at the breakfast room were very nice. I don't think, that I will stay at this hotel again. I already booked my next trip to London and this time I chose the St. Pancras Youth Hostel which is not far away and has a better service and more space (I stayed there before)."
23,503,"Jan 16 2008	Lack of Security and Surveilance	My mother, my sister and I stayed in the Albion Hotel during the last two weeks in December. Upon Arrival we were told that a laptop computer had been stolen from a room and that a report had been filed with police. When we arrived a few hours later there was a posted reward for anyone who had information regarding the theft. The next two nights we stayed were uninterrupted, and we assumed that things had quieted down.We left the hotel one evening and arrived several hours later. When we returned we quickly noticed that things had been rifled through. Our suitcases were searched to the bottoms. A digital camera was stolen, along with two cellphones. 80$ were stolen as well as all three passports, two ID'S and a driver's license. We first reported to the receptionist, then the police. The receptionist informed us that the surveillance camera in front of the hotel was inoperable, and had been prior to the first robberies. Conveniently, the hard drive containing the video had become corrupted as well. Anyway, I am just freely expressing my experience. Aside from this unfortunate event, the hotel is very comfortable and hospitable for the value of a London Hotel. I don't discourage staying there in any way. Cheers."
24,503,"Nov 5 2007 	Surprised	After reading the reviews on this site, I thought I'd take my chances.It rated better than others in this price range.I was expecting the worse! However I was quite surprised. Yes you do have to check in at the mentone across the road but that is only 30 steps away.The neighbourhood is quiet and non threatening-I walked through it morning noon and night.The room although very small, was clean and had the amenities I required. Breakfast was sufficient coffee, tea and toast.The staff were friendly and accomodating."
25,503,"Oct 16 2007 	Disgisting!!DISGRACEFUL and inhabitable!!!!!!!	8 of us(girls ) arrived at albion house hotel on a fri night at 1am after a flight and transfers to kingcross. We had to go across to the Melville hotel reception to check in. On arrival we were told they knew nothing about us(despite us having a printed confirmation and number and having paid a deposit).We were(after a considerable about of argueing with the man on the desk) brought to the carlton hotel around the corner. We were shown two rooms for 4 people per room. this hotel was grotty and two people per bed in a small queen size bed. the shower and toilet were beside each other in a tiny bathroom. the following morning we went to the melville reception where we were promised that they had rooms for us that night. We returned later that day after heading into london and were told that we there were no rooms for us, even though we were promised earlier that morning that there were. The manager was rude, obnocious and very very unhelpful but eventally showed us to a further two more hotels where our party had to seperate. The part hotel was one of thes. This was a disgrace! one of the rooms had lights hanging off the ceiling held in place with tissue paper, ripped wallpaper, a curtain hanging sideways by a thread and RAT bait in numerous areas on the floor. THe floor was filthy and the bed was broken in two areas when you sat on it. The bathroom was tiny and unclean!this was inhabitable and a helath and safety hazard!!! We were not contacted earlier in the day by the manager to inform us of this move, we could have had a chance to find somewhere else.The manager was so unhelpful and very nasty!!! In fact, a family with two small children arrived in the same situation and were left with no where to stay, obviously causing huge distress! We were only looking for somwhere to stay that was basic and clean, we weren't fussy travellors and this was neither. NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!!avoid anywhere on arglyle square/street. It's an absolute disgrace and totally unaccepatable. It's a big SCAM!!!!!!STEER CLEAR!!!!Inhabitable and Disgusting to sum it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
26,503,"Oct 15 2007 	terrible...bad bad service	We didn't actually mangae to stay in this hotel...seeing as the manager denied any knowledge of us despite the fact we had an email with confirmation number. The manager was really unhelpful..he 'helpfully' managed to find accomodation in a hotel down the road (the Park Hotel), in which we found our bed was broke, the bathroom light didn't work, the heat was 'stuck' on, the light hanging out of the ceiling, ceiling holes stuffed with toilet paper and worst of all actual RAT bait in the bedroom under the sink...disgusting. worst hotel i've ever stayed in...steer clear."
27,503,"Oct 9 2007 	Good deal on a budget	Ok people just remember, this is London, it's expensive! For 75 quid I imagine you could do much worse than this hotel. The room I had was shoe boxed sized but clean enough and reasonably decorated - there was even a trouser press! Not for the faint of heart was the 4 storey staircase to the top floor as there's no lift! Breakfast was moderately better than I expected, toast, cereal, boiled eggs and processed cheese if it takes your fancy. I wouldn't want to stay here for a week, but for a couple of days its good enough."
28,503,"Sep 12 2007 	Dishonest total unacceptable	Very dishonest and totally unacceptable! I booked Albion House but all guests who book Albion House have to check-in at Melville Hotel which is 1 minute walk. I booked a twin en-suite room for two nightsat Albion House and the guy at the reception of Melville Hotel asked me to pay all my room charge first, which I did. Then he showed me to Albion House. On the way, he told me that tomorrow I have to move to another room. He said he has given me a bigger room. The way he said that as if he has done a big favour for me! I stayed two nights only but have to change room every night. I felt this hotel very dishonest. I made reservation in July, if you cannot accommodate my request for a room for two nights, you can reject my booking but they confirmed my booking. I felt they are dishonest because the guy at reception never mentioned to me that I have to change room before I paid my room charge. If I knew that, there were &gt;40 hotels in that district, I maybe able to find another hotel. It was so troublesome as I have to pack and unpack.Besides, no bath soap and shampoo provided in the room, only a tiny piece of soap. The alarm in the room is not working. Breakfast is very simple, they give you 2 slices of white bread. On the counter, there is boiled egg, two kinds of cereal, orange juice or apple juice, some canned fruit, coffee or tea.I strongly suggest you do not stay in this hotel or other hotel underthis group which is Excelsior Hotel and Melville Hotel."

30,503,"Jun 11 2007	Great Stay - Great Value!!	As a regular business traveller to London, I always find that the Albion delivers great value and comfort. The service is great, the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. It's such a great place to stay that I always book here when in London."
31,503,"Jun 5 2007 	Excellent Hotel for Central London	My wife and I stayed at this Central London hotel for 4 nights and I can recommend it to anyone without hesitation. I am somewhat confused about some of the negative reviews on here because for the low price you pay, this place is centrally located, extremely clean, friendly, and we found that they will bend over backwards to give any advice on what to do/where to go in London. The rooms are airy and light and CLEAN, with modern but simple decor. An absolute bargain, and far exceeding anything we were expecting for this price-range.The only other comparable hotels I have found in Central London were about twice the price!If you are looking for an affordable, clean, centrally located hotel with friendly service look no further!!"
32,503,"May 13 2007 	Dont bother no concept of customer service	it was my boyfriends birthday and i thought i would treat him by taking him to the theatre in london and then spend a night in a nice not over priced hotel, i thought everything was going to be so perfect, but it was not our luck. in my reservation letter it said that the check out time was 10 am and check in was at noon, so i booked tickets for the lord of the rings musical at 2pm, which gave us two hours to check in, get dressed and ready and be in drury lane by 2 just in time for the show. when we arrived at the albion at 12 on the dot, first we found there was nobody in the actual hotel we were staying in (the albion) which was filthy with a red stained towel on the floor, we thought perhaps we should come back later, but in the end i noticed the very small notice outside saying that check in was at a totaly different hotel across the street, this was not stated on the website, but i thought that was alright, when we got there a strange woman who couldnt speak enlish asked us what we wanted and we said we were checking into the albion. this seemed ok and i had to fill in a dodgy 'check in' card, which asked for my credit card details, which i didnt fill in thank god. after about 20 mins of waiting around we were told that was fine we could leave out luggage there and come back in two hours at 2pm (which is when we were meant to be at the theatre) and that then we could get a room. i was very angry about this seeing as there was a complete case of false advertising as the actual leaflet they had in the hotel said check out 10 am check in a noon. her excuse was that the cleaner had to clean a whole 12 rooms and couldnt do it, at which point i tried to point out that if check out was at 10 that gave them two hours to clean, to which i recieved a reply that that didnt matter. i asked to speak to the manager and apparently he didnt want to talk to me, for what reason i dont know. so after an argument or two i told her that i would not be recomending this hotel to anyone and they are loosing customers, because its not as if i was asking for every single room to be clean, just one and surely the cleaner could have done that, because we had plans based around their times. as we were leaving we noticed a sign underneath everyone else's left luggage that said ' this hotel is not responsible for any luggage lost or stolen or damaged' so basically we were paying 70 pounds a night, to be made to wait 2 hours to check into a room, and have our possesions stolen in the process! dont ever go there, they have no idea what customer service is!"
33,503,"Dec 18 2006 	Clean Simple Unspectacular	First of all, bear in mind that in London hotels can cost a lot. I booked a twin room at this place for 75. I checked in across the road and the receptionist was very friendly. The room wasn't huge, but it was clean. The bathroom was miniscule and not fancy in any way shape or form. It served its purpose however and I was able to shower without feeling totally grossed out. There was a TV in the room which was a bonus.This place is located yards away from Kings Cross station which is convenient. I used it as a place to change and sleep before and after a party nearby in London. This is perhaps its best purpose: a stopover or a place to rest your head. Breakfast was simple: a couple of rounds of toast and some tea. It's a shame: I quite fancied a fry-up!Overall, I'd recommend it to people who need a place to crash out, but not to people who want anything fancy or a hotel with amenities. This is about as simple as it gets."
34,503,"Nov 27 2006 	Do Not Make A Booking At This Hotel - Terrible	I booked directly on-line with The Albion House Hotel on 30th October 2006 for a stay of 1 night on 25th November 2006On arrival I proceeded to check in at The Melville Hotel, 39 Argyle Square, which is a down market in need of a good clean sister hotel.Having waited 10 mins to check in, I was ushered to the room where the receptionist/owner? proceeded to inform me that they had just had a major water leak and the room that I was to stay in was flooded and she only had 1 room available within the Melville Hotel, this is on a Saturday afternoon at 3.30pm and she did not have the courtesy to call me (But I am sure they would have charghed had i not turned up.(Likely story - probably sold my room for higher rate)I proceeded to look at the double en-suite room at the Melville Hotel and everything you have read about this hotel is true. The room was the about 7ft *4ft, the curtains hanging from the window and it was four flights up a narrow staircase with no means of exit should there have been a fire. I would not have let a down and out stay there.Strangley the whole of London was fully booked and the receptionist/owner was rather uncaring that we had no where to stay.Well ended up in Croydon @ Jury's for 59.99 which was a palatial kingdom compared to the Albion House/Melville Hotel.So if you want a guaranteed room for the night and don't want a frantic search for a hotel, then don't book here.Awful experience - Awful hotel - Awful Customer Service"
35,503,"Oct 11 2006 	Absolutely loved this hotel	After reading all the reviews on this hotel i have to say i was a little dubious... but after spending a week staying there i have to say this was a fantastic place to stay! the location is ideal, the staff are really friendly and more importantly the rooms are VERY clean!!! Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in the area of Kings X and I am extremely fussy! but if you want to be near all the tourist locations this is definately the place to come!"
36,503,"Oct 7 2006 	A Cheap London Hotel - Clean and Friendly	London is the world's second most expensive city. Moderate hotel prices start at 120-150/night; cheap is around 50/night. This hotel is cheap, it has clean and compact rooms, it has few amenities - it is for sleeping not dining or swimming or dreaming you are in a 225/night Hilton.For its price class it is good, it is non-smoking, it is near King's Cross with Tube access everywhere. It has friendly staff and wonderful if treated with respect. It does not pretend to be what it is not, and $120 might seem a lot to some for a hotel room but it is peanuts in London where the Tube fare starts at $6 and a beer costs the same.This is an hotel to sleep in, nothing more."
37,503,"Oct 2 2006	Wasn't too bad!	Stayed one night at thhis hotel. Booked before I read the reviews so there was a bit of trepidation about staying there. It is correct that you check in across the road. The room and bedding was clean. Didn't find the area to be unsafe, its Kings Cross which has the reputation of being a bit 'dodgy', all large cities have there good and bad parts. The staff were friendly and polite.However, the breakfast was poor, with basically cereal and coffee and toast. There probably has been a bit of retouching of the pictures on the website but didn't have any great problem with this hotel. I booked it because of its close proximity to Kings Cross Station."
38,503,"Aug 25 2006 	Terrible . Did Not Even Stay	Booked through late rooms for just one night ,wish i had gone with my instinct and cancelled.We picked our keys up accross the road at their sister hotel. So glad that we were not staying there as it was horrible.As i had booked over the net I was taken to a back room to put my pin number in for the card transaction.This felt very unsafe especially as it was a very scruffy office with a very unwelcoming member of staff.We were then shown over the road in the pouring rain to our &quot;luxury suite&quot; by a lady who could not realy give us much info as she did not speak much english. Our room was on top floor, very small double, missing lampshades and marks all around one side of the wall the made me wonder what had happened in the room previously.Tiny shower room which i could not figure out how you were going to turn arround in and actually wash!As the room was disgusting and the whole building was like a furnace we decided after a discussion to leave. We told them it was not up to standard and did not dare ask for money back.we ended up booking into a hotel near baker street tube called the four seasond which was lovely and had a great breakfast the next morning."
39,503,"Aug 5 2006 	what a robbery for a hole in a wall	I was booked for one of the 3 other hotels they have. They charched and then told me, I would be in the albionhouse. What a dive. Dirty, very small, noisy and not save at night. Staff unfriendly. All for 60 Pounds. Not a bargain... a robbery!! Never never again. Had hairs of other guests in bed and toilet."
40,503,"Jul 21 2006 	The worst ever without question	The hallway and staircase are about 2 ft. wide and very steep. The room is microscopic, no place to put anything. Shower is 2 ft by 1-1/2 ft, if even that big. No clean towels and just one cheap, tiny soap for two adults for two days. Cheap styrofoam cups for, count 'em, 1 cup instant coffee, which was not replaced the second day. There was no phone in the room and no pay phone on premises. Breakfast in the cellar required a long wait in line for a space, and hostile kitchen help. And for this we paid over 75 pounds!"
41,503,"Jul 12 2006	Terrible	We stayed in room # 2 in the basement. Very small, no phone, the beds were terrible. You could feel the springs in the mattress. No air conditioning as advertised. TV remote didn't work. We received one towel each and a very small bar of soap. No &quot;Welcome package&quot; as advertisede. The room was so small we had to walk over our luggage. It was a terrible experience. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. No at all like advertised on their web site."
42,503,"Jul 11 2006	not a bargain	The Hotel is really in a remodeled home and the stairway is extremely narrow and steep, very difficult for any luggage. No lift available. The breakfast is cereal and canned fruit. The bathroom is too small to turn around in. It was clean is about the only positive thing that can be said, . There are no telephones in the rooms. The check in is located across the street."
43,503,"Jun 17 2006	worst hotel in London?	Possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are tiny and all up flights of stairs - don't bring large luggage. The paint job however is recent. I cannot believe any independant group ever gave this hotel 3 stars. My daughter and I stayed there and both of us were bitten by insects - or something worse. When a client called the hotel looking to get in touch, they were told that the rooms don't have phones (true) and the woman who answered was too busy to deal with callers. Then she hung up. This should be classed more as a hostel - one star, maybe at a stretch two - and priced accordingly."
44,503,"Jun 15 2006	Digusting Tourist Trap	I had booked a weekend in London at the Albion House Hotel. I was looking forward to the bright renovated rooms i saw around the internet and my wife was equally as excited. Im sorry to say that when we arrived the Albion House, we were told by the manager that there had been a problem with the website i booked it with and that we were to stay in the nearby Park or Melvin Hotel. Tired after a long journey i accepted these alternatives and ended up staying at the Park Hotel which is not even star rated. I felt very angry towards the online booking site, but after speaking with other guests in the hotel i came to the conclusion that this is no exceptional occurance when booking for the Albion House. We left the digusting hotel which was extremely poorly maintained and where noone could speak English to a communicative level, with a very bad taste in our mouths of London.I checked with the online agency and they had made the booking 100% correct as i had booked on the site. So the Manager at the Albion House had decieved not only me but also my fellow guests in the Park and i assume the Melvin Hotel.It appears to me that the Albion House is a honey trap for the other 2 pitiful hotels, and i would not want this to happen to overseas travellers, who will get stung by the experience and also have little to no help from the &quot;alternative hotels&quot;."
45,503,"Jun 7 2006	Elegant and Luxurious it isn't !	Once we found this hotel, we had to go to the sister hotel across the square to check in  which wasnt specified on the booking, so only knew this once wed found the Albion,  then we had to try and find the other hotel! (good job it wasnt pouring with rain!) It then  took about 15  20 minutes to check in, service very slow, and they were very vague  about the booking itself, unsure on what price it should be etc When got to the room eventually, I had thought Id booked a double, (but later found out I  had booked a twin in error) They were very unaccommodating and rude when I asked to  be swapped for a double  they said it wasnt possible. However, the Luxury Twin  described on the website and quoted on my booking was in fact a very small twin, with a  bathroom with shower only and you could only just about get in the room, smallest hotel  bathroom I have ever seen! It did seem clean enough however, but the actual beds themselves were the most  uncomfortable we have ever slept in and I have travelled all over the world extensively  and stayed in very budget hotels as comparison! What springs were left were sticking in  my ribs, I had to get spare pillows out of the wardrobe and try and sleep on top of these,  we both felt dreadful the next morning through lack of sleep, and now have bad backs! Breakfast was in a very small canteen type room, again it served the sister hotel also, so  very cramped and it was busy. You got toast with jam and 2 choices of cereal with tea  or coffee and orange juice, that was it  so a bit disappointing  toast was rationed when  we asked for more. All in all a disappointing stay, but location-wise it is ideal for King's Cross tube station and  getting to the West End. I don't know if all the rooms are the same standard as ours was."
46,503,"May 12 2006 	Mixed views	Myself and my workmate travelled down from Edinburgh for a one night stay in the Albion. When we got there our taxi driver warned us that the area was terrible as it is right across from King Cross Station and is actually a red light district! He said we were lucky to only be staying there for only one night because if we were staying for longer he said we should move pronto! Whenever we told people where we were staying they all gasped and said &quot;Oh not the best area then!&quot;. When we arrived at the hotel at about 8pm, we had to go across the road and receive our keys from another hotel which I didn't have a problem with. However, the hotel you have to go to, to collect the keys, was an absolute dump. Thankfully we weren't staying there!!We then got taken back across the road by a gent who showed us to our rooms. We both had our own separate rooms. My room was really nice, spacious and looked exactly what the pictures on the website looked like. It had a double bed against one wall and a single bed against another which I'd imagine they'd use as their family room. Everything was clean, bright and had plenty of fresh towels waiting on my arrival. The sink was outside the bathroom so the toilet consisted of the toilet and a section for the shower which was away from the toilet. There was tea and coffee, a television on the wall with remote and a lovely dressing table area for putting on make-up or drying/straightning your hair in a large desk space. I thought was room was excellent value for money and I had a great nights sleep there.My workmates room however was slightly different. Although my colleagues opinion would probably differ from mine, I found her room to be clean and just what the advert states - Single room. The room was very small however and only had space for a single bed, wardrobe and sink which was all closely packed together with a tv on the wall. The toilet was more like a combined toilet/shower and the shower head was actually over the toilet seat. So, I would imagine to have a shower, you would have to sit over the toilet or something. Also, the toilet handle was apparently broken. The room was very small however it was clean, was bright also and was only to do for one night. My colleague also said she couldn't get to sleep because of people banging on her walls and she never felt safe enough to go to sleep. I, on the other hand, found none of these problems and found my room and the hotel as a whole very nice and most obviously just been refurbished in a tasteful bright design. The next morning, my colleague left early and didn't go to breakfast as she just wanted out of the hotel, while I went downstairs to their lovely little breakfast bistro where you can have a quick bite to eat before you head off. You can choose from tea or coffee, toast or cereal and fruit juices however that was all that was on offer. That was great for me as I don't eat bacon etc in the morning but if you did then it could cause a bit of a problem as I didn't see anywhere near for you to have breakfast.Overall, I found the stay pleasant enough and really liked my room and the hotel. I didn't find the area a problem whatsoever - it's not as if I was out walking along the streets on my own at midnight anyway! Perfect for only 60 in central London. Going by what I saw i.e - MY room I would stay there again if I had to go back to London on a budget."
47,503,"May 9 2006	Misleading.......	The photos of the albion house hotel are a joke....it is nothing like that. I stayed ina single en suite room. The bed was tiny, the room was tiney, the shower was tiny, everything was tiny! However it was clean...so thats one positive. But I would not stya there again, purely because I know I can get a better size room for my 60. If it was say...40 then I think it would get better reviews. But no way is this place a 60 hotel."
48,503,"Apr 20 2006	What a rip off	The room shown as a single room on their web site is NOTHING like the real thing! I was given a room the size of a shoe box - so small I had to move my suitcase whenever I moved in the room! Unfortunately I didn't take a picture of the room for comparison but the floor area was about 2m x 2.5m The bathroom was a small cubicle with the shower rose almost directly over the toilet so you had to remove the toilet paper from the area before you showered and then you were left with a totally wet toilet!Although the advertised price was GBP 50 , I was charged GBP 60!Believe me you DONT wanna go there!"
49,503,"Mar 14 2006	Awful and very misleading	I didn't know about Tripadvisor.com before I stayed here, but I wish I did. All of the problems I had have already been written about!My partner and I stayed at the Albion House Hotel for the simple reason that it was close to Kings Cross Station and it sounded great on it's website. We were only staying for one night luckily, before getting a train elsewhere in the morning.We had a bad impressions from the start. We found it very hard to find as we arrived at nightfall and the area itself seemed so dodgy. We got to the Albion to find a note sticky-taped to the door telling us to check in at another hotel in the square, the Melville. We dragged all of our luggage there and went inside to an extremely dumpy looking 'reception'. We stood there waiting for so long before anyone would help us and they were so rude when they finally did come out, and we could barely understand them as their English was so poor. When it came to payment, they took our credit card away to a different room and didn't come back for 5 minutes, which made us very nervous - they could have been copying our details down or anything!Finally they told us we'd need to stay in a completely different hotel called the Excelsior. He insisted it was a higher quality hotel. We dragged our luggage to yet another hotel, mighty annoyed by then. We then had to carry our luggage downstairs to our room. The room looked slighty more promising when we walked in, with new but extremely cheap furnishings. We started to relax and then realised we could hear alot of traffic and it was very cold. Upon further inspection, we discovered the window was broken and jammed open. Considering it looked straight out into a deserted alleyway, we were not impressed safety-wise. We had to go back to the Melville and try to speak to the guy, who came into the room and tried to downplay it. We insisted they change us rooms, so more luggage being dragged up stairs and we went into another one. Finally we were ok! We still felt very unsafe though and dragged suitcases in front of the door and the window when we slept, just incase.The entire establishment just seemed so incredibly dodgy - it definitely needs some sort of regulation by the hospitality industry. I didn't feel safe or comfortable at all, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The detail on the website was so inaccurate and misleading. Will never ever stay here again!"
50,503,"Dec 16 2005	Loved the Albion House Hotel	After reading the reviews about the Albion we had some reservations about staying there but decided to give it a try. It was absolutely GREAT! 12 of us (ranging in age from 8 to 73) stayed for 7 nights to celebrate my parents 50th wedding anniversary and it couldn't have been a more pleasant experience. No one was rude like others reviews have indicated. Actually we found Patrick and Cheerie quite helpful, recomended a great restaurant for dinner, helped book tours, etc. The rooms are clean and new, yes the bathrooms are small but for the price what would you expect? Breakfast was fine - toast, cereal, fruit and the staff was smiling and accomodating. We rented a few triples and doubles and one quad. All 12 of us from various places in the US were very happy with the Albion. We can't wait to go again!"

1,527,"Nov 16 2009 	Needs Upgrading	One positive is the good location - very easy to get to Paddington Station. My room was on the 3rd floor..no elevator and no assistance with luggage. Very narrow stairway. the carpet in the bedroom needed to be cleaned, the wallpaper was peeling off the wall and there was black mould in the shower. I will not stay here again."
2,527,"Oct 23 2009 	well located very small and expensive	Clerks speak very poor English (Irakians, Bulgarians, HongKong). Rooms are tiny, barely the size of the bed. Shared bathroom, no elevator, very narrow (and steep!) staircase.Very expensive considerring the conditions.Please avoid!"
3,527,"Oct 2 2009 	Ok for the money - just	We had two rooms booked - mine was fine though deep down in the basement, reasonably modern furnishings, my collegues was very jaded and dirty, staff not overly interested Breakfast was OK. The location is very handy and quiet"
4,527,"Sep 9 2009 	Great location friendly staff but needs refurbishing	I stayed 3 nights her during my first trip to London. With Paddington station sitting a short block away, the Ashley's location is nearly unbeatable. Any of central London's attractions are easily reachable. The staff were helpful (including a dynamite restaurant recommendation), but when I asked for some soap on my last night, they had offer me the used bar from their staff bathroom. The hallway contained some large tears in the wallpaper, and the carpets were in several places threadbare. Breakfast was filling but not really tasty. The tiny room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. Bath facilities were adequate for those sharing baths, but were not available on every floor. For some reason they choose to charge 1/hour for wifi access, which was mostly reliable, but not always."
5,527,"Sep 2 2009 	Good budget hotel but a touch grotty	Good location, quiet rooms, decent breakfast but getting rather tatty"
6,527,"Aug 30 2009	Well its British...	Move this hotel to most other European cities - it would be crap. But: This is London, and for London its quite good. Location: 1 block from Paddington tube/Heathrow Express, McDonalds/a few Delis around the corner. Its on a very quiet street, so no noise at night at all.Reception: super friendly and helpful receptionists. They still see visitors as guests and welcome you. This alone justifies 5-stars. Again: This is London, check out other hotels and they wont even look at you...Rooms: Ok, there are 2 sets of rooms. The cheap room without ensuite/shared bathroom outside, and the ones with own bathroom. If you take the non-bathroom-rooms I wld recommend room 401. There are a few other ones I looked at, 401 is def the best single room.Prices: Gv them a call to book, do not book online. If you call they are more flexible with the rates... also, if you stay close to a week, ask for a discount. You should get the no-bathroom-room for GBP35. For that location - you wont beat that.Overall: Its an old, british hotel, they didnt invest in the past 20yrs or so. BUT: They kept everything clean, staff is very friendly, its location is great for tourists, and: its cheap."
7,527,"Aug 20 2009 	Adequate for my needs	Stayed here for one night last weekend, and am booked to stay again this weekend on my way back through London. Overall, no complaints. The single room was tiny but clean, and the shared bathroom was also clean. The room was quiet, even with the window open at night. Breakfast was great, I thought the selection was fine, and the staff were all friendly. I was impressed that when I checked in, the receptionist, noticing my huge suitcase suggested that I leave it in the baggage room rather than carrying it up to my room, which I gladly did. I am staying here again in a couple of days, and with the convenient location right around the corner from Paddington station, I will most likely use it again in the future."
8,527,"Aug 13 2009 	Clean but cramped not good for a long stay	We stayed on the ground floor, with a bright floodlight and a street lamp shining into our room at night, where we had to keep the curtains somewhat open in order to get air through the small opening in the window. (We later asked for, and got, a decent table fan.) The price was lower than at other places, but the room was pretty cramped, with three parallel single beds and barely any space to walk. Blankets and bedspreads were iffy, though sheets were clean. There were also one desk chair at a desk-sink, and a wardrobe. The staff varied in friendliness, and we were told different things about the computer in the basement, which was never available to us, even for a fee. Breakfast was in an airless basement room, decent enough, but not special. The bathroom was clean and adequate, though very small. Dailty replenishment of soap and towels was good, as was the location near Paddington tube station. In addition, an all-night small grocery was nearby, and the green (and quiet) Norfolk Square was lovely, and the park was open for walking and sitting."
9,527,"Aug 13 2009 	TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE	Before booking a room on line I went through the reviews of this hotel and thought that it would be an averagely good place to stay. I do not know what kind of rooms/hotels the people who've written the positive reviews are used to staying at, but in my experience this has been the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Except if one believes that &quot;budget&quot; means having to put up with filth, respiratory problems, and rudeness. This is what I had to go through in the hope that future clients are well warned. We checked in at 1.00pm Saturday 1st August but unfortunately did not check the room and left for a walk around the city. When we went back to the hotel in the evening we were given a room at the basement of the hotel (room 3), with a window overlooking a dirty yard full of rubbish. Furthermore, the room had not been cleaned from previous occupants, the bed was unmade and there were dirty towels on the floor!!! Making a complaint and demanding that we are given another room we were faced with a rather rude reception manager who finally agreed to give us a room on the third floor. When we entered this room (307) we were literally taken aback by a smell combining dampness, dust, and something resembling urine!!! Being exhausted by the trip and the really long day, we decided not to complain again but get some sleep and try to put up with it. Woke up in the middle of the night because somehow, for some reason, the smell had got even worse and despite the open window, we were unable to breathe properly. I need to say that the wallpaper in this room was torn and dampness could be seen on the walls, the carpet was not only threadbare but also had not been swept for ages and there was filth visible on it and on the furniture. Last but not least, the pillow cases in the bed had not been changed and there were makeup marks on them. Needless to say, in the morning, we asked for yet another change of the room and a different reception manager (less rude and more professional) agreed to give us another room which was on the first floor, and at last stayed there for the rest of our five day holiday. It was again small, with a tiny bathroom and not terribly clean, but tolerable and without a smell!!!!! All in all this has been the worst stay I have had in years of travelling."
10,527,"Aug 4 2009 	Very Unpleasant Stay... :(	Im surprised at the number of average reviews this place has received. I'm not sure what kind of accommodation these users below are used to but this hotel certainly does not merit any appraisals. On first glance the hotel does seem neat and fits in with the London &quot;low budget&quot; travel accommodation. Discouraging was the lack of elevators especially if your room is on the upper floor, but not quintessential unless the guest is elderly. Things started to go downhill when we entered the room as my friend started dry-reaching from the moldy odor the room emanated. We opened the windows, rested our heads on the pillows and slept immediately due to lack of sleep. I avoided the blanket altogether as I was sure would contain bugs, and stayed beneath the white sheets. In the morning we noticed the extent of the mould. Mould is a serious heath hazard and this room displayed mould everywhere; walls, ceiling, toilet... As we used the bathroom in the morning for the first time we were absolutely disgusted and had to check out immediately. Hair! A large tuff of blond hair was stuck on one of the shower walls, some in the drain. My friend noticed this while he was in the shower and was on the verge of sickness. We cut our stay by one night. We informed staff about this. They offered us another room but this was not an option. We checked out and kindly requested our second night to be refunded. They claimed that if there was to be a refund it would occur through the website/agent we booked through. I have travelled extensively and been to many hotels and I know this is not the case and in-fact the website hotline made it clear any refund would have to be issued by the hotel itself. Misleading hotel staff. I would recommend to avoid unless the dozen hotels on the same square are fully booked."
11,527,"Jul 28 2009 	Great Hotel for family on a budget	A great location, just a few blocks from Paddington Station. Very friendly reception staff and good breakfast included in the reasonable rate. Perhaps the only hotel in London with a room that will sleep a family of five! We look forward to returning."
12,527,"Jul 10 2009 	Cheap and great location	I stayed here in room 12 for 2 nights in July. The room was small (twin room with single beds next to each other) - should really be a single room. The en-suite was again small but was cleanish. The biggest draw back for me was the heat - it was like a sauna - therefore it was difficult to sleep. There was a fan which made very little impact. If you are looking for somewhere cheap, quiet, with excellent location then this is the place."
13,527,"Jul 7 2009 	adequate and convenient	on the positive side - it was close to Paddington and a very nice Garfunkels and Litle Venice. The receptionist was very sweet and the staff friendly. The price was cheap and the bed comfortable however, our room, 107, smelt damp and it looked like it should have been a single room not a twin - there was no space between the twin beds. The bathroom was very small but clean(ish). I was disappointed by the English breakfast which consisted of a couple rashers of nice bacon but, the sausage was overcooked and the egg was like rubber - no beans or tomato or mushrooms. We actually decided to have our breakfast in Garfunkels which was yummy!!! The room was also very hot and it was difficult to get to sleep - I did get a fan on request though so not all complaints. To sum up - for what we paid it was more than adequate but I'm not sure I would go there again."
14,527,"Jul 5 2009 	Excellent apart from Breakfast	I stayed for two nights my only complaint about my room was it was on the 4th floor and there is no lift! It certainly keeps you fit climbing all those stairs. Apart from that it was very good, comfortable bed, quiet location and excellent value for money. Breakfast was a disapointment - Cooked breakfast consisted of Egg, Bacon and the worst sausage I have ever tasted - very thin, no taste and almost uneatable. Also you have to help yourself to hot drinks and fruit juices in the next room. I went to get a second cup of tea mid way through my breakfast and being on my own, by the time I got back to the table the waitress had cleared the table.I would certainly stay in this hotel again when in London - but would hope for a room not on the 4th floor. Also I will know not to ask for a sausage for breakfast."
15,527,"May 23 2009 	Not bad at all	The location is great - 3 minutes from Paddington tube and station - excellent. I'd booked a single room with bath, which turned out to be a small room on the landing with a strange two-part entrance (through the door up a very narrow little staircase to the actual room). The bathroom was a tiny plastic cubicle in the corner and the shower part of the cubicle would not fit a grown man neither in height nor width but I managed. The room was cleaned every day and I can't say really anything bad about it. London is expensive and you don't get more than you pay for.Service at reception was fine, the English breakfast was fine except it finished at 9am already. A bit early, if you're on holiday, which I would presume most of their clients are. Also, on the first morning, they'd run out of eggs. How can a hotel run out of eggs??But if that's the only bad thing I have to say about it... I'd come back."
16,527,"Apr 30 2009 	decent value burt some problems	i agree with what most others have said- the location near paddington train/underground station is very convenient, the price on expedia was reasonable, the hotel is generally very clean. the best thing about the palce was the large breakfast (but terrible sausages that noone ate) and themn excellent dining room staff. they were consistently very nice and efficient. the cleaning staff were also very good workers. the desk staff were another story. there was an asian woman who was very helpful but there was another male day stafperson who was totally disinterested in customer service. he was cold and not helpful. the rooms were clean but VERY tiny. the hotel was quiet the 2 weeks that i stayed there, but sometimes noisy outside on w/e nights. i'd probably stay there again if the price was discounted."
17,527,"Mar 25 2009 	good price nice bedroom	Great location (next to Paddington station), in front of a nice and quiet square, with restaurants near it, including McDonalds and BurguerKing. The personel is not always friendly, but they are efficient. The breakfast is ok, with eggs, bacon and saussages (not my favorite dish). The bedroom is clean and good size, but has carpet all over it, and the floor screetches with every step you take. The bathroom is also clean, but has stains on the walls and is very, very small. A tall big man does not feet confortably in there. And the worst thing: there is no lift! Try to carry heavy bags on narrow stairs..."
18,527,"Mar 11 2009 	Cheap somewhere to rest	I stayed here for 4 nights in Feb. It was very cheap for london so wasnt expecting a great hotel. The area is great lots of places to eat, right next to a tube station so perfect for a stay in london. The rooms where small and need up dating and the 'en-suite' was a shoe box the toilet was basically in the shower. Other than that the rooms where clean and warm so perfect just to rest in if spending your day out of the hotel. The staff where ok, breakfast staff where really pleasant, i only paid for continental and they kept try to give me full english every morning. Which i only turnt down as was in london doing a personal training course so im always careful with what i eat and dont see that as a great breakfast to go excise on."
19,527,"Feb 17 2009 	Smashing Time	This is a budget hotel so any other expectations re accommodation are a little trite. If you are a skinflint like me you will be attracted by a great price, excellent location including breakfast (We paid about 147 for 2 nights for 3 people). The rooms are small; en suite is shoebox size, a little musty as well however you pay for what you get. We were pleased with our general stay; the staff were courteous and friendly apart from the receptionist who appeared a little cold and un interested at times. It was a quiet setting with tube about 2 minutes away with a great selection of cafes near by. London on a budget was fine, museums inc Tate Modern were fun. You dont have to spend a fortune in London if you just plan the visits carefully. We enjoyed Covent Gardens at night. We would stay at the Ashley again unless we won the lottery of course then we would stay at the Ritz."
20,527,"Dec 27 2008 	Great Value for Money for London	We went to London on a shopping, sightseeing and cultural trip (in that order). So we wanted to stay somewhere central, close to all the top destinations but wanted to save our pennies to have more for shopping. Hence our choice of Ashley Hotel.I have read all my fellow travellers reviews of this hotel, and they are very mixed and quite harsh sometimes, which in my opinion is totally unjustified.The hotel location is superb, just off Paddington station (e.g. Heathrow Express - very handy) and you are literally minutes away (by bus) from Oxford Street, the British Museum, Madame Tussauds etc. Now there is a Hilton around the corner but if, like us, you prefer to spend your money on shopping, then Ashley is a very good choice.OK, the rooms are small (not handy if you have a lot of luggage) and the bathroom is the size of a shoebox. I have never seen one so small, actually. BUT! Everything is clean, safe, the breakfast is ok and there is a lovely park just outside the hotel. And there is wi/fi thoroughout the hotel.You just have to be realistic about your expectations. London is one of the most expensive cities in the world and large hotel rooms come with a hefty price tag. Ashley Hotel has fantastic location, and anyway, there is more to do in London than stay in your (large) hotel room, so Ashley gets my vote!"
21,527,"Nov 24 2008 	Things are going downhill at the Ashley!	I have stayed at the Ashley Hotel on about 4 occasions per year for the past 10 years or more. I have found the hotel to be fine. It's basic but clean and I have never had any complaints until now.However, things have changed radically in recent months following a change of ownership. The first complaint I had was that they insisted I pay for my stay immediately upon arrival. I refused on the grounds that I was a regular customer and that I would pay on departure as i do in all other hotels and as I have always done in the Ashley. They finally relented and agreed I could pay on departure.My second complaint concerned the breakfast. As a Bed and Breakfast establishment they really only have to get 2 things right i.e. the bed and the breakfast! The Ashley advertises a full English breakfast. The most important feature of the English breakfast is a large pot of tea ( or coffee if you're that way inclined). Imagine my surprise, therefore to find that the breakfast table had been set with no cups - just the saucers. When I enquired about the apparent oversight I was told that the cups were available at the buffet bar and that I had to make my own tea from a boiler located outside the breakfast room. If I needed a second or third cup of tea, I would have to go through the same ritual. That, to my mind is not a breakfast, much less an English breakfast. I'll be looking elsewhere for accommodation in London for my future trips."
22,527,"Oct 3 2008	basic hotel with small roms	This is a basic hotel, rooms are clean but small. Also there is no elevator and the hotel has 4 floors. I paid GBP 39 per night for a room with shared facilities, basic English breakfast included. Booked with hotel website www.ashleyhotellondon.com . I recommend this hotel for people on a budget, but I would not stay at this hotel for more than 1 night because of the size of rooms.The Paddington area is nice and quite with a few restaurants and bars: the hotel is about 3 minutes walk from Paddington tube station."
23,527,"Sep 19 2008 	It's fine but don't expect anything fancy	This place is conveniently located just a couple of mins walk from Paddington station. It is clean, basic, and good value. I was expecting something basic, comfortable, and functional and that's what I got - nothing more, nothing less. The breakfast is quite good, especially seeing as though it's included in the tariff, and the waitstaff were pleasant, though not very efficient. My experience was tainted by the poor reception service. The man on reception when I was there was completely indifferent, abrupt, and spent all his time on personal phone calls. Everytime I approached the desk, even just to walk past, he was on a personal phone call. It just doesn't do anything for the image of the hotel, especially when it seemed that many of the residents were there on business, as I was. Hauling luggage up the narrow and steep staircases is not fun, and the staff will not offer any help, but fellow patrons will, as they have experienced the hassle for themselves!This hotel offered wireless internet access at a fairly cheap price, but my room was so high up I couldn't connect! So I had to set up down in the lounge, which was ok but less than ideal, as I was working.The toilet/shower was no bigger than a closet, but it was clean and functional. I wouldn't want to have to use it for many days in a row.This place is fine if you're a fairly independent, unfussy traveller who just needs somewhere clean to sleep at night."
24,527,"Aug 28 2008 	Comfortable and Clean	I stayed here for a week and my only complaint is that there was no elevator, so I had to navigate 59 steps up and down each day and evening. Once I finally got my luggage upstairs it wasn't so bad, but that first trip was a challenge. The room and en suite bathroom was immaculate, always my biggest concern. Good shower; plenty of hot water. The bed was very comfortable, also important to me because I have some back issues. VERY convenient to the Paddington tube stop -- only about a two minute walk, and there are lots of pubs, restaurants, markets and the train station nearby. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels, coffee, tea and soap were left. There is no A/C, and at first the room was stuffy, but opening the window solved the problem. For the most part, the front desk staff were helpful and pleasant, although I think one of them really hates his job. If you just want a comfy, clean and affordable place to crash at night, it's perfect. Not luxurious, not romantic, but a good value all the same. I would stay there again."
25,527,"Aug 25 2008 	Good location but...	This hotel is conveniently located about 2 mins walk from Paddington station but the room that we stayed in for 2 nights left a lot wanting! The 'toilet/shower' was the size of a tiny closet, just about the same size as one of those portable toilets on the street. Breakfast was nice but was only up til 9am. The 'quiet' square was actually quite noisy as we stayed on the ground floor, facing into the square, and just next to the reception desk. There was no privacy at all as the beds were just a stone's throw away from passer-bys on the street!"
26,527,"Aug 11 2008	Chaos	Stayed in the hotel for a few weeks Monday To Friday this July First week in the hotel was average .Room was clean but very hot. I felt comfortable enough staying in hotel so I booked for the next two monday to fridays.Now the trouble started, when I arrived on the Monday the room given was a double rather than a twin as specified on confirmation e-mail.I agreed to stay in double if moved the following day. I was not the only person at reception trying to get sense out of management. A man next to me had gone to work and on his return his room had been let out. The receptionist tried to ring the manager who told him to wait to see in there was a no show. Th ereception told us staff had been going into the bookings and changing his bookings.Finally move to very shabby twin room with pull down bunk beds.The following Monday I was given a twin which was two singles pushed together with one headboard. The room was fine until I discovered a bedbug in my bed when I got up on Wednesday morning. Slept on top of bedsheets next night,camcelled my future booking with The Ashley and told workmates not to stay there ever."
27,527,"Aug 6 2008 	Basic reasonably comfortable good value	I stay in this hotel from time to time as Paddington is my 'point of entry' to London and it's convenient, the beds are generally comfortable and the hotel is in a fairly quiet square. It's also clean and good value by London standards. The rooms are mostly small and many of them have tiny 'wet cubicles' for showering. Rooms at the back lack a view unless on the top floor, but can be quieter. Ground floor can be quite noisy depending on when people are leaving. I think this is a good B&amp;B hotel for a 1-2 night stay if you don't want to spend much time in your room. There's a discount for top-floor rooms (no lift) and for singles without shower in the room. Occasionally I've had problems with getting enough water to the shower, but this seems to have been resolved in my last couple of stays."
28,527,"Jun 6 2008	Don't book room Nr2!	First thing to say is that the ownership has changed three months ago and the new web page is http://www.ashleyhotellondon.com .It wasn't my first stay in this hotel, but it was the first stay in room Nr2: ground floor, with window facing the window of a room in front of (don't know the number of that room), and in the night (of course) you can hear every guest entering the entrance door. Latest guests come around 7am and first guests leave approximately at the same time.My advise: don't book ground floor!Otherwise I can only confirm: it's clean. I was there only for one night this time, so it didn't make much difference for me where I slept, but I wanted to be in a clean place, and this hotel offers this."
29,527,"May 22 2008 	Okay for One Night	After traveling around England I came back to London for 1 night. If getting a train to Heathrow from Paddington, this is a good location. It's 1 block from the station and they hold your suitcase in a locked room after checkout free. Plus it's cheap, only $120 for a single, including breakfast.But what a sad little room! Mine looked into another window across a narrow shaft. Could NOT open the curtain. The shower and toilet are in a small closet that a larger person might find impossible to use. The sink was IN the desk (see photo). Everything was clean, but the bed was old and covered with an odd variety of blankets. No suitcase rack. A tiny bar of soap and a tiny TV that got 3 channels (those were odd too!) perched high on the wall were the only &quot;amenities&quot;. Although a notice said to ask for an iron or hairdryer at the front desk. I could NOT spend more than ONE night in a room like this."
30,527,"May 13 2008 	Clean quiet hotel	I'd stayed at this hotel a few years ago but between booking and arriving the hotel website disappeared from the internet and from the booking site which made me a little nervous. Apparently the hotel management has been taken over but it made no difference to my stay. I had a single room on the first floor, overlooking Norfolk square. The room was as I expected, small but adequate with a small but adequate bathroom. The room was kept meticulously clean and the staff, whether in the dining room or the cleaners or the desk staff, were always helpful. I stayed for 10 days and found the location (2 minutes from Paddington tube) excellent. There are restaurants &amp; pubs &amp; internet cafes etc in the area. The area is usually quiet though there was noise in the square one night after an important football match (important to some- not me!). There is no airs conditioning and no lift so if you were on an upper floor or it was very hot it might be awkward. Although I had only one case the receptionist was willing to carry it up for me- not necessary for me bu tif you were elderly it would be helpful.I had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed the full breakfast and quiet surroundings."
31,527,"Oct 31 2007 	Simple and clean hotel	Last weekend I spent two nights in a single room. I tried to make the booking via hotel's homepage = email but haven't received any reply within a few days therefore I called them directly, consider that they seem not to read emails. After arrival I noticed they have a PC but manage occupancy of rooms within a big paper notebook. Generally I found strange telling them the complete security data of my credit card via phone.Location is excellent, very quite and safe also during the night. The single room I stayed in was really small, relatively simple, but nice and most important clean. For sure you havent seen a smaller bathroom before :))but its clean and there was enough warm water. The window cannot be opened and has low noise insulation, fortunately outside there is normally no bustle. The room can probably get warm during summer since there is no AC. Double bed rooms seem to have reasonable size.The staff (at least during my stay) was Asiatic and in the breakfast area not very professional (a lady forgot to bring me promised additional toast, ok, can happen). English breakfast is averagely, beans and tomato are not served by default. Close to window I managed to connect wirelessly to a free internet access point.In summary, this is a clean, recommendable place with gut value for money (for London circumstances)!"
32,527,"Sep 11 2007 	Things to know befor you go.	This hotel was clean and convenient it was good value for money. However there were a few things i wish I had know befor I went. My sister and I had a double room, but the two single bends had been put side by side, this made it difficult for me to get into and it didn't feel like we had any space to our self. Breakfast is only served unitl nine, not great if you want a lie in. There are a range of cereals on offer, which is good but the english breakfast consisted of 1 sausage, 2 rashes of bacon and a fried egg. This was disappointing, even if there was the option of beans or tomato's it would have been a lot more genrouse. The bathroom in the room was smaller than some caravan bathrooms I've been in, Realisticly people don't spend the majority of their time in the bathroom. At 5'4&quot; and a size 10 I didn't have any problems with the space but if you need to you can shave your legs in the shower while sitting on the toilet (you would also easily reach the sink to brush your teath if you really want to multi-task) but don't expect to be able to streach your arms out to their full length (I couldn't).On the whole the staff were friendly but not always helpful if we needed transport advice, more towels (the towels are small and unabsorbent). The location for this hotel was fantastic, and the area felt safe. If your not going to spend alot of time in your hotel then this would be a great option for you. I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here again, but I would avoid it either."
33,527,"Jul 13 2007 	Great Family Hotel	We stayed for a week, and were very happy with the hotel. We were in a family room - small, but workable. The bunk bed was perfect for our kids - boy (13) and girl (11). Close to the tube (Paddington Station), and direct access to/from Heathrow. 10 minute walk to Hyde Park. Breakfast was good for us and the kids - even our picky eater. Staff was very, very helpful. Best value we could find by far, and we would definitely go back."
34,527,"Jul 9 2007 	Overcharged for Phone calls	The hotel is fine - can be noisy. Big downer at the end - they charged me $25 for a phone call I didn't make. The manager would not budge. Refused to believe I hadn't made the call, and was really rude to me."
35,527,"Jun 25 2007 	A friendly base in Paddington - London	We stayed for two nights at the Ashley Hotel. It provided reasonably priced clean accommodation in an ideal location to explore London. It is situated on south side of Norfolk Square in Paddington, London and is a short walk from Paddington Underground Station. Likewise, Hyde Park is very close.There are numerous restaurants in the area within easy walking distance.The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. We asked the receptionist to suggest a Restaurant late in the evening when we arrived that was within walking distance. We were directed to ASK, an Italian Restaurant on Spring Street which served Pizza/Pasta/Salads at a reasonable price. It was just around the block and was an excellent recommendation. We dined there on two occassions.Our room was located on the third floor and contained a small seperate ensuite formed in the corner of the bedroom in which the shower and WC were to be found. The associated wash hand basin was located in the bedroom itself. Simple accommodation, some would say basic, but most importantly clean. There was plenty of hot water at all times. The Hotel is a labyrinth of staircases leading up four floors and it looks as though it was originally three town houses which are now joined together. A kettle was provided with tea/coffee etc. There was also a small TV in the bedroom with remote control.Breakfast was served from 7.30am to 9.00am in the basement dining room. This is not as grim a location as it initially sounds as the Ashley Hotel is a Victorian Townhouse and its basement, whilst below street level, receives natural daylight light from it basement windows set back from the street.Breakfast consisted of help yourself fruit juice and cereals, followed by an 'English Breakfast' of two slices of Bacon, a fried Egg and a Sausage and was quickly served by the waitress. The Bacon was particularly of good quality. (No white stuff ) Several customersasked for scrambled eggs instead of the fried egg and this again was no problem. A rack of Hot toast, white and wholemeal, was served at the table together with a pot of Tea/ Cafetiere of Coffee etc. When we asked for a refill, this was again quickly served. A good basic filling breakfast. Check out time was 10.00am. As we had a late afternoon train, we asked if we could leave our bags. Again no problem and we were directed to a storage room which was unlocked by the receptionist.To conclude, the Ashley Hotel is a simple no frills hotel. But then again that's what your paying for. It does its job very well."
36,527,"May 26 2007 	Charming good value hotel in London	We stayed at The Ashley Hotel for 8 nights. We walked in off the street inquiring about rooms after our originial hotel was not fit to sleep in. The Ashley put us up in a family room until other rooms became available. This hotel is very close to Paddington and Hyde Park. The staff was very helpful, especially Billy. The breakfast was what I expected for a budget hotel, cereal, juice and a cooked breakfast with eggs, bacon, and toast. The rooms are clean and yes, the bathrooms are very small, but adequate. If I ever go back to London, I would stay at this hotel. Overall, a pleasant experience."
37,527,"Apr 2 2007 	Great value and clean what more could you want on a budget?	After a horrrible experience earlier in the month at The Spring Park Hotel (Finsbury-see my review) I took more care this time and read the Trip advisor revierws carefully! My only real desire was that the hotel be clean, on a 50 budget this is not always possible in London.I paid 45 per night on a 4 night stay, the hotel is located 1 min walk from Paddington station with numerous stores, supermarkets and fast food oulets right on it's doorstep along with several Internet cafes, it is convenient! All the buildings in Norfolk Square seem to be hotels, some look cleaner than others.............The lobby is small but clean, no lift, my room was on the 2nd floor you would not want to have a room on the 4th if you are forgetful. the room was clean, it didn't smell, I nearly fell over with relief after the Spring Park experience. It was a little faded but had the basics, a little TV, kettle, several drawers and a good sized wardrobe. My toilet/shower was not en-suite but across the landing, no great problem but it was one of those kit built pods and very small.The breakfast is served in the basement (another reason not to have 4th floor room). the room is large, clean with lots of space for everyone and a good selection of cereals and fruit juices. Toast and English breakfast is included also and was fine. Plenty of friendly staff so service is quick.The only downside for me was that you are given keys so that you have 24/7 access. I hate this sytem as I always lose the keys, I'd prefer a keypad entry but now I am nitpicking! For 45 it is a bargain."
38,527,"Mar 1 2007 	Good value great location!	Stayed at the Ashley Hotel for 4 days beginning Saturday, Feb. 17. The location is excellent! Literally a 3 minute walk to both Paddington Underground Station and Paddington Rail Station. Therefore, transportation is a snap. The staff was very friendly, including the folks in the breakfast area in the morning. The breakfast is good, too. You get a cooked egg, bacon, and sausage, plus you choose from a group of cereals, juices, etc...In addition to my room key I got a separate key which got me into the building. Access to the building from the street was very easy. There are lots of small convenience stores and small eateries within quick walking distance, which again makes the location ideal. Here were my only concerns:1. My shower did not have water that was very hot, just warm. This was not a one-time deal, since this occurred each morning and once in the evening, when I tested the temperature. 2. The window of my room, which faced the street, did not close all the way. Therefore, the noise outside, of which there seemed to be quite a bit, was loud and awakened me on several occasions. I did not understand the abundance of noise; and it just wasn't Saturday night. There are lots of hotels in Sussex Gardens, so I think hotel stayers enjoy carousing at night. If I stayed here again, I would request a room that does not face the street. Other than that, I recommend this hotel."
39,527,"Feb 24 2007 	Godd value and location	We are a family of 4, 2 teen girls, we needed a place to stay close to Paddington to get an early train to Heathrow the next morning. Picked this hotel based on these reviews at TA. We were not dissapointed. By London standards a good value, 105 GBP for the night, just around the corner from the tube and train station. A decent selection of restaurants right there. A short walk to Hyde park, near Marble Arch. we even walked to SOHO, maybe 20 min walk, took the tube back. Decent sized room, friendly staff, full English breakfast included, no lifts though, not a problem for us because we travel light. I would stay there again for sure."
40,527,"Jan 5 2007 	Great little hotel	The Ashley was a perfect location and a good price for London. We stayed for 3 nights on the top floor which was a bit of a hike (no elevator) but we got a discount on the room. The room was small but clean. The location was great, right next to Paddington station and close to many pubs and cafes."
41,527,"Jan 4 2007 	Great time at the Ashley :)	Booked this hotel as a present for a friends birthday. 1) We couldn't understand the receptionist on the phone when we asked for directions so got a taxi from Paddington tube station guessing that it was close, taxi man went on a little round about trip that cost 6 pound when the tube station is about a 3 minute walk from the hotel! (Not the hotels fault but not impressed!!) 2) Reception area....where!? Small desk in a small corridor! 3) Given keys to our room, when we went in the sheets were on the foor.... we put our bags down and sat down for a minute to have a housekeeper come in and give out to us and tell us to come back later!! 4) So we went exploring the hotel. Our room was up at least 5 flights of stairs. Then the breakfast room was down in the basement.... At this stage me and my friends (3 20year old girls) were very creeped out by this hotel, felt like the only people in the hotel so we proceeded downstairs to the5) &quot;tea room&quot; ie a kettle where u make ur own tea and put money in a jar!! A chair is covered in teddybears and I popped my head in through some beads hanging down from a door where a selection of knifes where sat on a counter!!! We didn't mind treking up and down the stairs but when I forgot something and had to go back up it gets a bit annoying!! 6)Bathroom is TINY!!! I have worked in ahotel with small bathrooms but this is a cubby hole. Also the sink is in the bedroom! shows how small the bathroom was! 7)Beds where tiny, I ended up on top bunk where I was so close to the ceiling I was afraid to sit up!! 8) Also if you want a bath, baths are located in random rooms along the floors! Don't think I would like wandering back up to my room in a towel!! Very strange! 9) Other than that we had an amazing time in London, met the nicest man doing the BigBus tour just outside the hotel. Gas man from Cork :) Don't expect nightlife in Paddington, we decided one night just to go to a pub back in Paddington and they wer all closed (at midnight on a Saturday night) so we stayed in the hotel with a few bottles of wine :D I wouldn't reccommend this hotel for the old unless they request a room on the first floor. Only the fit and healthy should stay here and if your planning on getting drunk those stairs are impossible to climb!!!!"
42,527,"Oct 18 2006 	A welcome retreat	After our initial first night in London at another noisy hotel in the same street, we decided to look for other accommodation. We saw the Ashley and was very pleased to be accommodated for 3 nights. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Although the room was small, it was clean and adequate for us. As we come from Australia the bathroom was exceptionally small but very clean also. Breakfast was good with choice of fruit juices, cereals, bacon, egg,sausage, toast, tea and coffee. The price to stay at this hotel was very reasonable and we would stay again if we return to London,it was so close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park which is an additional plus. No lift unfortunately and the only other comment I can think of is that maybe the rooms would be better with ceiling fans to circulate the air. There is heating, but the rooms can be quite warm and stuffy even with the windows open. Other than that a good little hotel at a very reasonable price."
43,527,"Oct 4 2006 	great place to stay	The good - great central london location (1 min walk from Paddington station) Great breakfast, good service, comfortable room, quiet inner city streetThe bad - bathroom was fairly small (even allowing for the fact I know how tiny some B&amp;B rooms and bathrooms can be in London - this bathroom was tiny)Generally you dont come to London to stay in your room all day. With that in mind the small room is not such a hassle and in fact is what most tourists will find unless you want to pay mega bucks at a big name hotel for the luxury of walking through a grand lobby before your get to your tiny room. The service was excellent and the staff very keen to please. The location is great especially if you come into London on the Heathrow express or want to get on the Euro star at Waterloo (paddington is on the same line)"
44,527,"Jul 20 2006 	Ashley Hotel is a charming and cheap place to stay	My wife, 10-year-old daughter and I stayed here for two nights in June 2006. We loved this charming little hotel. It was inexpensive, in an excellent location, and provided a filling breakfast in the basement dining room (tea, toast, eggs, English bacon, cereal). Our room was small but clean and had its own bathroom with a shower. The room was everything we wanted and needed at a very affordable price.The staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel is a very short and easy walk from Paddington Station (and the Heathrow Express). The hotel is located on Norfolk Square in Hyde Park. The surrounding neighborhood is vibrant, with small restaurants and green grocers. The night we arrived, we had a nice dinner in an Indian restuarant just a few steps from the hotel.The next morning we walked from the hotel to Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum in about 20 minutes. Bustling Edgeware Road, with its excellent selection of Lebanese restaurants, is just a few blocks away. You can take a bus on Edgeware Road to the sightseeing districts of London along the Thames.Overall, our stay in this hotel was positive in all respects. I highly recommend it to the budget traveller. Reviewers who gave low ratings to his hotel were, in my opinion, being quite naive. If you paid a low price for a small hotel in a charming neighborhood you shouldn't have expected it to be the Waldorf-Astoria. Admittedly, the room we stayed in at the Aashley Hotel was small. But it was clean, safe, quiet, and cheap."
45,527,"Jul 19 2006 	This hotel is like an old friend	I first stayed in this hotel in 1979 and enjoyed it greatly. Years later, after staying in a lot of London hotels that cost a lot more, I decided to look it up again. I found it was still operated by the same family and had improved considerably. Most of the rooms had been refurbished. Since the late 90's I have tried to make it my place to stay when in London. The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly and professional, the location is great."
46,527,"Feb 26 2006	Comfortable home-from-home	I last stayed at the Ashley in August, 2005. On my first morning, I found that my travel alarm wasn't working, so for the remainder of the visit, I especially appreciated the automated wake-up call system. I recall noticing on a visit several years ago that they had installed it, but I had never really needed it before. All I had to do was let the receptionist know sometime between 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM what time I needed a call, and he or she programmed the system. It worked perfectly reliably every day.The staff and management are friendly and helpful. The Managing Director is in the breakfast room each morning to offer touring advice to guests who ask, or to ask guests what they're planning for that day. If the plans are for something that he isn't familiar with, the next day he'll ask how it was so he'll know whether or not to recommend it to others.On the rare occasions when I've discovered a problem in my room, it has been taken care of promptly, thoroughly and with a smile. For example, on one of my recent stays (can't remember if it was in August or earlier last year), I discovered upon arrival that I couldn't open the window. I phoned the desk and a few minutes later the handyman appeared at the door. He had the window open and easily operable in no time flat.I've stayed at the Ashley for a week or longer each year since 1995, and will return twice this year. It has become my &quot;home-from-home&quot; in London. Wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else!"
47,527,"Oct 26 2005	A Great Hotel with a Few Flaws	I stayed at this hotel from October 22 to the 25. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They assisted in recommending some restaurants and tourist spots. The entire hotel and my room was very clean. Their are no elevators therefore you should request a room on the first floor if you have plenty of luggage. The beds and pillows were firm and soft. The staff will fulfill your requests for extra sheets, towels, and pillows when needed. My room was facing the street where I heard plenty of noise throughout the night. Be aware that their is no receptionist between 10 PM and 8 AM. Therefore if you need an early wake up call you must bring your own battery operated alarm clock since the room I stayed in had no alarm clock and no electrical outlet. The location of this hotel was excellent. Paddington station is only 2 blocks to the left of the hotel. From there you can catch a 15 minute express train to the Heathrow airport. The area is also filled with restaurants, internet cafes, shops, and grocery strores for any late nite bites. The breakfast is was small but filling. It included one fried egg, bacon and sausage along with unlimited toast, juice, cereals, and coffee. I did'nt like that they served breakfast until 9 AM, being that you must be up early in order to have the free breakfast. Most hotels I stayed at served breakfast until 11 AM. Some suggestions- When travelling in London, avoid the cabs as they are extremelly expensive. Take the train from the Paddington station. Their are bus stops around the corner from the hotel as well. Also check out the brochures in the lower level of the hotel where you can find discounts on sightseeing tours."
48,527,"Sep 17 2005	An excellent value for money in London.	The Ashley Hotel is a charming little hotel on a quiet square that is very conveniently located one block away from Paddington Station, giving guests easy access to Heathrow airport in 15 minutes, as well as access to the Underground and multiple bus lines. I stayed at this hotel from 7-11 September. I had booked a single room and upon my arrival, they put me in a larger double room as I had a large amount of luggage and they said the single room would be too small for me and my bags. They put me in a double room for the same price as I had reserved for the single room! This impressed me right from the start. The room was on the small side for a double, but more than adequate for one person. It was nicely furnished and had all the amenities a budget traveler could possibly need. TV, electric kettle with plenty of coffee and tea supplies, a small but perfectly functional bathroom with shower ensuite, and a small desk. If you need a hair dryer or an iron and ironing board they will loan them to you for the remainder of your stay. The mattress was soft and comfortable. They have a large delicious breakfast included in the price which includes plenty of juice and cereal, coffee and tea, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast. At all times, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Closeby there are many restaurants, pubs, convenience stores, currency exchange , and a laundrette, and Paddington Station has many shops and supermarkets. I give this hotel 4 out of 5 because the hotel does not have an elevator and the stairs are narrow and steep, as in most buildings from this era. Still, they give discounts for rooms on the top floors if you are willing to get some exercise. Also, the water in the showers only got adequately hot in the mornings, the rest of the day if you wanted to take a shower the water only got lukewarm but still adequate for bathing, and the water temp did tend to fluctuate at times while showering. Overall however, the Ashley hotel is an excellent budget hotel and a great bargain for central London."
49,527,"Aug 12 2005	A very cozy and warm b/b!!	Before our trip to the UK, I spent two weeks looking for a perfect and affordable accomodation in London for our 3 night stay in August and I found the beautiful Ashley Hotel. Everyone there was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our room was warm and inviting. The location was fantastic for those who travel from outside the UK. Many shops and eating establishments are within a few steps. The free English breakfast was more than enough and was delicious. The beautiful Norfolk Square is right outside the door. The hotel was quiet although my traveling companion could hear some train noises but I could not. If I ever get a chance to travel to London again, I would most postively stay at the Ashley Hotel. One thing I thought was funny was I never once saw another visitor in the halls but I did see them at breakfast!"
50,527,"Jul 18 2005	Great for families	Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ashley Hotel. We arrived at Paddington Station directly from Heathrow and walked the 2 blocks to the hotel. The hotel is located right on a small park where we often spent time reading to escape the heat.  Our room on the top floor was complete with a double bed and &quot;Murphy Bunk Beds&quot;. Albeit small, the room (complete with ensuite shower and toilet) was clean and very adequate. Our room overlooked the park below. Breakfast was abundant with choices of juice, cereal, and hot English breakfast of ham, sausage, eggs, and toast, all of which were quite good.  The staff was helpful at all times offering restaurant suggestions and directions. Everyone was very friendly.  We will definitely return to the Ashley Hotel and recommend it to friends and family as well."
51,527,"May 24 2005	Left Before Staying	Reserved this hotel for one night in 05/05. Checked in, saw room, immediately had an allergy attack due to dust/mildew/mold (although room looked clean). Saw another room that was dark, dreary, depressing, and overlooked an air shaft. Immediately checked out and went to stay at another hotel."
52,527,"Apr 18 2005	Very warm welcome	After reading some of the reviews, I was not sure what to expect. We booked a double room [alpine room] which was situated on the top floor. I think we may have had a bigger room than normal, as we had a room with a double and single bed. Everything was there that was needed, including plenty of hot water, clean towels and it was generally clean and tidy.The staff where very friendly, helpful and polite, and made us feel very welcome. The inclusive breakfast was also very good, egg, bacon, and sausages. Plus a selection of cereals, fruit juice, toast plus coffee or tea. All served up quickly.The location is literally just few minutes walk from Paddington main rail station, and even closer to the tube. Several restaurants and shops nearby plus takeaways, and a cashpoint. The bus tour of the city picks up within a minutes walk from the hotel. To sum up, its an excellent budget hotel, close to the main transport links. but in a quiet location. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
53,527,"Dec 16 2004	Nice clean and comfortable place great breakfast	Very close to tube, quiet location with pubs, restaurant and also internet caf just around the corner, nice and quiet victorian palace with a pleasant decor, very kind and warm staff, relaxing view on the square with a garden, we staied in the double ensuite room n.5, 1st floor and it was very clean, comfortable and large: no problems with our luggage, also had a little cupboard and a lot of drawers, bathroom with tiles was clean and not smelly such as most of others hotels have, shower also clean and large enough. Definitely above the average of London Hotels, don't compare with American style, but it's excellent to relax and to have a really tasty cooked english breakfast!I really recommend it!"
54,527,"Nov 30 2004	So disappointing	Our stay at the Ashley Hotel was sooo disappointing. I booked the room for myself and two friends visiting from the States based on some good reviews I read here and other places. Were we in the same hotel?? I now know the dull and depressing review is the correct one. The room was way too small. I know to expect small rooms in London at this price, but this was ridiculous. The entire room was so shabby and the shower barely worked. We had to carry our lugguage up four huge flights of stairs with no help. When we immediately discovered no toilet paper, we were told one of us would have to come back down (and back up again) to fetch it. This hotel took away from our trip and was a huge let down. Try the Barry House Hotel down the road for a low cost B&amp;B that is really family run and close to Paddington Station."
55,527,"Oct 27 2004	Ick!!!	ICK!!!My first (single) room faced the front of the hotel. The window leaked lots of cold air and lots of street noise all night. The bed was very short and very worn out.The &quot;closet&quot; was a place for a couple of hangers under the TV shelf, hidden by a raglike drape!The bathroom was typical of many retrofitted London rooms and was the fiberglass &quot;capsule bathroom&quot;. But the worst problem was that the room's plumbing had a powerful leak of SEWAGE STENCH!!!I actually stayed in this room since it was a late checkin and I had no choice.I switched rooms for the second night and requested an upper room on the back side (for quietness). I got this request granted. But the new room had a broken shower head, cracked/blistered/falling plaster, and a deafening TV from the next room.Both rooms had no place for my 21 inch rollaboard bag so I had to unpack/pack with it on the floor in front of the nasty bed!This room required a 92 stair jaunt to or from the breakfast room in the basement.The breakfast was the worst English Breakfast that I was ever served. The sausage tasted like cardboard.When I asked to store my bag for a pickup after checkout, I was told to leave it in the basement breakfast room. Fortunately, when I returned for it later, I found it ungaurded along with others still in the breakfast room.I since switched to the Sidney Hotel near Victoria Station/Pimlico where I have returned to 5 times."
56,527,"Aug 16 2004	Really liked this place	Stayed here in late July 2004. Walked out of the St. David's across the Square and found this place. This place is very clean, mostly bright and friendly. There's a good breakfast served every morning and the staff is accomodating and friendly. The hotel was full all nights I was there. They also let you keep your room keys and it felt very safe to me, compared to others. There is no AC, so be sure to get your request for a fan in early. Convenient to Paddington and shops in the area. Can't understand other reviews that call this little hotel dirty... I'd stay there again."
57,527,"Jul 25 2004	clean friendly and welcoming	I read some of the reviews on here before i stayed at the ashley hotel and i was so worried about doing there cos there was some really nasty ones.But when i arrived all of those worries went right out of the window!The hotel is a gorgeous tall old victorian townhouse, its clean outside and very welcoming. It is in a great location, about a 3-5 min walk to the nearest tube station, train station and bus routes to all of the sites. there are lots of local shops and places to eat, and if u like walking the walk to oxford street is pleasent and takes about 30 mins.in the reception u are greated by a very friendly person, there always seems to be someone around :), there are 3 old houses joint together and the receptionist will direct you to your room etc and tell you what building you are in.we had a twin room on the fourth floor, (not reccomended for the disabled, old or unfit) the walk up the 6 flights of stairs is hard and steep. but being right up the top is very quiet and the rooms are much cheaper up there. there are also rooms on the lower floors and more expensive.the room is an average size, the beds were comfortable with clean sheets. you are provided with a radio, tv, dressing table, mirror, tea and coffee making facilities and a large wardrobewe had a en suite, which addmidetly is VERY small, and is the only bad thing about this hotel, but it had a great shower, it was clean and had everything we needed.in the morning you go down to breakfast where are u greeted by the hotel owner and waitresses who are VERY efficent and friendly! you can help yourself to as much cereal and juice as you can fit in, you are provided with tea, coffee, and toast! and get the option of a cooked breakfast which consists of sausage, bacon and fried egg, but they will scramble it if u ask :)please try not to listen to the bad reviews on here, some people are just hard to please, this hotel is in a perfect loaction to see london and is a home from home hotel.i will definately be returning :)"
58,527,Jun 15 2004	Wonderful stay	I have stayed at the Ashley Hotel many times since the early 90''s. It is a clean and cozy b&amp;b. Very nice and friendly staff. Great location. Would certainly stay there again.
59,527,"Apr 11 2004	Dull dirty and depressing accommodation	Yuk! This hotel is typical of many of the B&amp;B joints around Paddington station - dull, dirty and depressing. The rooms of small and the 'furnishings' resemble cast-offs from a charity shop. Whereas the carpets would be rejected by Oxfam. And the breakfast - the service is woeful and the 'food' is inedible. I wonder what overseas visitors to the Ashley must think of Great Britain? Shame on this hotel and all of the other over-priced and simply sub-standard establishments in the Paddington/Sussex Gardens area! They must be nominees for the worst value for money in the world and are a scab on the name of London. Please pass ther Prozac."
60,527,"Nov 10 2003	Got what ya paid for	Another Portland reviewer! This hotel was OK, it was cheap and location was good. The room was very small and the bathroom was doll house size. The breakfast is Ok and you can get the greasy fried eggs scrambled if you ask. Much better. The staff was very pleasant. You get what you pay for. We didn't pay much and got what we expected. There are at least 2 dozen other small hotels on this street, which is a great location. I'd check out the establishments but they all looked modest."
61,527,"Oct 4 2003	Avoid this one	A rather seedy hotel. I'm not sure the sheets were clean; the bed was all springs. The shower had mold and mildew, the shower curtain had a layer of grunge along the bottom and a filthy toilet brush was stored in a corner of the teeny, tiny bathroom. The staff were pleasant enough, but you can do better in this location (Paddington) and this price range."

1,529,Oct 26 2009 	Aston's Apartments are good value in an expensive city.	Aston's is very well located in a quiet street in Sth Kensington with a short walk to to the Glocester Rd Tube station. We took the Executive Apartment which is bigger than the standard one and has a good bathroom. Well worth the extra cost. Self catering with good supermarkets close by makes an easy alternaive to eating out all the time if staying for more than a couple of days.
2,529,Sep 20 2009 	Great Place To Stay In London	These apartments are in a great location with Gloucester Road tube station a few minutes walk away. Very clean rooms and friendly staff. Apartments are fully equiped with everything you need. Would definitely stay there again.
3,529,"Sep 17 2009 	Great location close to museums shopping and on Piccadilly Line.	I've stayed at Astons on a number of occasions now. I keep coming back because of its central location. It is close to museums, shopping , restaurants, etc and it's on the Piccadilly line near Gloucester St station.I also find it is clean and staff are friendly and helpful. You have to pay for WiFi but the connection is great which is useful if you are in London for work. The kitchenettes also mean you can cook and eat in. It would be great if the rooms/bathrooms were a little larger with space set aside for suitcases in the rooms but these criticisms are minor."
4,529,"Sep 8 2009 	Drab and dreary...but the place has its redeeming features too	When we arrived at Astons, ragged with jetlag and exhaustion, I couldn't believe my eyes. Our &quot;triple apartment&quot; was a single room. Drab walls. Drab carpet. Hideous curtains. Three narrow beds with white linens. An all-in-one bathroom with a weird shower arrangement. The strangest &quot;kitchen-in-a-cabinet&quot; I'd ever seen. No proper mirror, only half a closet, no alarm clock, a small television perched precariously on a stand, an inaccessible table crammed in the corner, our extended family spread between locked buildings with no way to enter the other buildings.... I honestly thought there was no way I could stay in this hotel for a week. But we went to bed, resolved to figure something out when we were less tired. And with a little more rest to clear my head, it seemed workable. Over the week, we came to love the location (close to a tube stop and essential businesses). The place is clean, and in a nice residential area. We didn't spend that much time in the room anyway. Be advised that some of the rooms are a long walk up numerous flights, and those facing the streets can be noisy. If you have multiple rooms, you may not end up in the same building and will have to call to let each other in the front door. But the price is reasonable and the location really is great. Lower your expectations and you'll be just fine. With that caveat, and for a budget traveller, I would recommend Aston's."
5,529,"Aug 13 2009 	Lots of Hot Water	I got a single room for 68 per night - but even at that bargain price it was not worth the money. Luckily the room had a balcony, otherwise it was more like a hermit's cell.The kitchen was no real use. For microwaving meals and making tea it was just OK.The fridge needed defrosting badly, and woke me up a couple of times in the early hours as it hammered away to keep cold. I was also awoken by the slamming of the main front door several times, despite notices requesting people to close it quietly.The bathroom was extremely compact; the hand-basin far too small, and the only redeeming point was lots and lots of hot water."
6,529,"Aug 2 2009 	Great location helpful staff clean private rooms!	I stayed at Aston while on a recent trip to London- on a recommendation from a friend. The location is great, the room was clean and private, and it was very quiet- which usually can be the most challenging aspect of staying at a hotel/b&amp;b. The rooms are located in apartment buildings so it feels homier than just being crammed into a big building full of rooms. I would recommend a double as I heard that the singles are TINY. There is no breakfast included, and I wish they had their Internet available at all times instead of just in the evening...but otherwise it's a great place to stay at reasonable rates for London!"
7,529,"Jul 18 2009 	OK but not worth the money	Stayed in the Astons for a week in April. We chose it because of the location and the price. Also, since we were staying a longer time it felt like a good idea to have our own kitchen so that we would not need to eat out every night.We like the South Kensington/Earls Court Area so the location was good. Quiet residential area, 5 minutes to the tube station, several bus lines to different parts of the city, easy acces to Heathrow by tube.Apartment was really basic. Room was small even by London standard. Not the ideal choice when staying for one week, really cramped for two adults when our luggage and shopping filled every available space on the floor and one small table. Bathroom was really tiny, similar as in the cheaper cruise ships. Kitchenette useful for making a sandwich but not much else since there was so little room either to cook or have your dinner. Clumby bed and pillow, sheets were not changed during our seven nights stay which was really disappointing.Considering the standard of the room and that there was no breakfast, we did not get the room for good price. In the same area there were rooms available in four-star hotels for the same price."
8,529,"Jul 11 2009 	Tiny 	I checked in with my husband and young son. We were shown to our 'triplet' room by a very helpful attendant, but were soon dismayed with the size. Tiny and I mean tiny - say around 17m2.Anyway, I had arranged a travel cot, which I quickly returned because it was full of dust and looked like it had been sitting in a garage for years. At least they tried.The double bed is two singles pushed together and the mattress was so small, that we couldn't put the baby on because he'd slip. So we moved a mattress from the spare bed onto the floor, then the dining table onto the spare bed in order to create some room. We all ended up sleeping on the floor.The other thing is that the bathroom is also tiny - like 1m2. We may have gotten used to all of that, except that the cleaning was not up to standard. When we moved in mu sinuses immediately went crazy and I ended up spending some time dusting the room because there was so much dust everywhere and I had to complain on one occasion for the room to be cleaned because they had done such a sloppy job.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place."
9,529,"May 24 2009 	A home away from home	I thought the office staff were kind and considerate. Very helpful with directions/restaurants, or anything that you needed. I ended up staying an entire week there b/c I felt very comfortable and the prices were decent for great location. I felt safe at night in the neighborhood and the place gives you a feel of walking into your own apartment. I wanted to experience of what it would be like to live in London and felt that my time at Astons was perfect for me. There are not many frills to the place but the little kitchenette allowed me to keep some food and water to lessen the cost of eating out. I stayed near the front door initially and the constant slamming of the door was annoying to me. However, I moved to a room on the 3rd floor and the door was no longer an issue. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a less touristy type of experience in London."
10,529,"May 19 2009 	I love this place I've stayed before and I will definitely stay again!	This place is clean, friendly, comfortable, great location, and an all around great bargain.I really like the idea of a room with a kitchen so that I can use it for breakfasts and a few dinners. I also like having the ice in the room which is not something you see much in the UK in a place that is not on the level of the Ritz. The location is very central and the Astons is five minutes from a tube station and Glouster Road is a straight shot to Heathrow."
11,529,"Apr 21 2009 	In the heart of London it's a great place small rooms but well equipped	It's a residence, not really an hotel but in a perfect position, very calm and well equipped. The price is good."
12,529,"Apr 16 2009 	Room was robbed on the first night of our stay	I can honestly say I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Friend, family, or even foe should steer clear. The first night in London we returned to our apartment to find that the door had been opened (not a forced entry) and items were missing from our room. Astons refunded us for one day and offered to move us to a different room in the building. The circumstances lead me to believe that the person who entered our room had key access, which narrows down any list of suspects. The room itself was in serious need of repair. The bathroom ceiling was heavily water damaged and all the faucets leaked. We also had a problems getting the stove top in the kitchenette to turn off. The next time we visit London we will not even entertain the thought of staying at Astons Apartments. A horrible experience."
13,529,"Mar 27 2009 	Do not stay here	I am fairly low key traveller.. i need the basics, cleanliness, a proper bathroom, room to breathe and functioning equipment. basics really. I booked tow weeks here thinking it would be convenient location to Gloucester tube (which it is) and provide me with a bit of savings for the two weeks. I walked in, took a look at the room, the toilet seat that was hanging on hinges, the huge cracks in the walls and chips of pain, the tiny TV and the overall smell and literally walked right out. I lost my deposit of course, but i would rather pay NOT to stay here. I could not have been more depressed. Really.."
14,529,"Mar 9 2009 	absolutly worth the money - great location	Before booking this trip I watched hudreds of reviews, because I needed a central location but I was scared to finish into a rat shoe box in central London. Me and my boy were looking for a job for him, so we would have been around all day and we needed a cheap but clean place with a wam shower and a bed. Reading the previous review I automatically booked an &quot;executive&quot; room in advance, and the price wasn't very different. Don't expect anything executive as you maybe mean, but in overall my vacation went very good and the Astons made it easier.We arrived very late, we found the place easily (get down in Gloucester road metro stop, walk with the starbuks on your left hand and turn on your right when you see a gate around a garden, the second on your left is Rosary Garden, in total 3/5 mins walk) but the door was closed; we rang and there was out envelope with the keys ready; apartment number 20 was next door, and to be honest when I entered I had a bit of let down... very far from the pics I saw, so different that I thought that they made a mistake giving me the famous small rooms with smaller shower; I thought to find a room plus a kitchenette plus a bathroom, but: - the room is not an apartment, is a room with a bathroom, that's it; spacious, very clean, with a large table, hairdrier and iron; the problem is that in the website the kitchenette looks to be in a different room, that is not true: the &quot;kitchen&quot; is INSIDE a place that maybe once was a wardrobe;  - doing the kitchenette into this place, there's almost no wardrobe; - being this kitchenette 1 meter far from your bed and being almost no ventilation inside, every smell will remain with you all the time; once we &quot;half burned&quot; a toast and the fire alarm rang almost immediatly!We were too tired to call in order to know whether there was a bigger room or whether we were in the right one for what we paid, so we went the day after to reception; Ross told us that our WAS the executive apartment; I don't know how regular ones are, but I'm happy I was there :))But honestly, after this first doubts and in spite of little picky things ( shower not perfectly cleaned, bed done sometimes roughly), I have to say that Astons were the best solution I found, and the reason for which I give 4stars are: - the location is excellent for metro, buses and you can easily walk in town, getting to Harrods in 10/15 minutes walk (for London distances is nothing); if you feel lazy you can also remain in Gloucester area as you'll find fast foods, tesco, internet cafes, KFC and coffee place, hairdressers and a small mall; this saves you lots of money and time in movements - staff is extremely helpful and professional, both man and woman we met: internet is free from 6pm to 9pm (more or less), we forgot to print a resume and there was no problem; reception opens daytime and they help you out in all ways they can, showing you other rooms if you need and giving recomendations for where to eat and visit. They also explained us that underneath the bed there were some drawers to help up capacity of that small wardrobe - if you do not plan to do a serious spaghetti with ragu alla bolognese, the kitchen is honestly a good idea in a city expensive like London: you can buy at Tesco the necessary for your breakfasts and save a lot a lot and a lot of money: the kitchenette has a microwave, a fridge, a toaster, a coffee maker, cups, etc etc - after all I heard about London central hotels with less than 4 stars, I'm happy I was thereBasically a good experience and I'd be back."
15,529,"Mar 7 2009 	Great Value!	The Aston's Apartments are made up of 3 townhouses. My 21 year old son and I were put into #29, Room 25. Room 25 looks exactly like the picture on their website of the twin bed regular unit. We were thrilled to get the balcony we wanted and even though we were in London in February we did use it. The '&quot;kitchen unit&quot; is wonderful. It consists of all the plates, pans, cutlery, corkscrew, tea pot, mugs etc that a person would need. We did not use the burners, but we did use the microwave, kettle and fridge. I discovered that if I didn't have time to do my breakfast dishes before heading out for the day the cleaning staff took care of that for me. I didn't expect that! We saved money on meals by purchasing our food at the nearby Tesco (everything you need is there including alcohol) and at the Borough market (a great outdoor market ...be warned, it is extremely busy and lineups can be frustrating). Our beds were extremely comfortable and came with lovely duvets and clean sheets. Good pillows, too. There are drawers under each bed that we only realized were there after a few days...good for storage. We also had a nice dining area, TV and phone. We never had any problem with noise from other guests or outside noise. Downside? The bathroom is really small. I mean the toilet is practically in the shower and the only thing separating the toilet from shower is a shower curtain which actually touches the toilet. It did get a little musty smelling in there toward the end of the week. If you really must have a luxury bathroom don't go for this unit. I think the executive units are more posh. I have to say that the bathroom size didn't bother me a bit. I'd definitely stay there again. We loved the quiet well to do neighbourhood and we were just a few minutes walk from the Gloucester Rd tube station and a couple of blocks from the internet cafe (really nice people there) that we used every night. We felt extremely safe and left our balcony doors open each night for fresh air. The staff were pleasant, but we had little dealings with them other than check in and check out. We did have trouble with our shower at first (our own fault; we couldn't figure out how to get hot water at first) and they offered to move us immediately. We liked our room so much though, that instead we took a key for another room that we were told we could use for our showers. The only thing that disappointed me was that we asked for a cab to be called for us when we left and one came immediatley, but it wasn't a real London cab. It was a Mercedez Benz and it cost us 25 pounds to go to Paddington Station! We were ripped off. I wish they had called us a real cab. We were in walking distance of The Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrod's (Harrod's was about a 25 minute walk). We like to walk and so didn't find it too far to walk to Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Harvey Nichols although those are of a greater distance. There is a movie theatre about a 10 - 15 minute walk. We used the underground everyday and felt comfortable going all over the city."
16,529,"Jan 8 2009 	I think I know why the reviews are mixed...	I think I know why the reviews are so mixed...I stayed in Aston Apartments on an overnight business trip to London. I booked a single, but at the last minute my boyfriend tagged along. We figured, what the heck, we'll squish up in a single.Well, when I walked in the room I almost cried. In fact, I think I did. The bed looked like it had been rescued from a charity shop, all the fittings and fixtures were raggedy and worn out, and the &quot;bathroom&quot; was a kind of all-in-one-plastic-perhaps-meant-to-be-on-a-boat-or-train wet room.While I was out at my meeting, my darling boyfriend did the best thing ever, and upgraded to a double - and I think maybe even an &quot;executive&quot; or something. What a difference! A beautiful, big room, lovely bed, clean, new, big bathroom, and so on.The reason I'm giving them a low score is because I originally booked in the single room which they expected me to be happy to climb about 10 flights of stairs to get to, and which was, frankly, crap."
17,529,"Dec 6 2008 	Excellent value	The rooms are very clean and well-tended by staff. All rooms have kitchenettes, which are particularly useful to the traveler. The higher-priced designer rooms are quite beautiful; the more inexpensive rooms are plain and simple, but comfortable and very functional. The management was very responsive and prompt when asked to address problems. Very good value is given for the price charged."
18,529,"Nov 16 2008 	Just right for us	My wife and I came down to London for a two-day course in the city. We were looking for overnight accommodation with breakfast near the city centre. Although SW7 is not a central locality Astons suited us very well indeed, being easy to access on the tube, and not too far to walk from the station. although this was not the original intention we actually preferred provided our own breakfast. There is a Waitrose supermarket right next to the station where one can buy the basics for breakfast. Rosary Gardens is very quiet so we did not mind not having a bedroom at the back. These are very small but v. well fitted out and spotless. We have never seen a kitchen fitted in a cupboard but the novelty interested us - everything needed for a preparing a light meal was provided so we decided not to go out for dinner. I commented to a colleague from the USA that the 'kitchenette' and bathroom were not big enough to 'swing a cat in', much to his puzzlement! If you wish to have a good night's sleep in a decent clean and quiet environment, we recommend Astons above any low-cost centrally located hotel providing breakfast. We paid BPS 94 for the double, and we would definitely stay there again on short trips to central London"
19,529,"Nov 10 2008 	High priced shoe box	The location was fine, and I suppose it is an expensive area. However, the triple studio was very small, with en ensuite about the same size as in a caravan.All together, not a comfortable stay for 3 people."
20,529,"Sep 26 2008 	Astons Apartments beautifully located efficient and quiet	My mother (82) and I spent a week in London to visit my son who is working there and travelling (everywhere!). I chose the Astons Apartments based on location and kitchenette facilities. Both are important when travelling with my mother since she needs time to get ready in the morning and it also saves us time and money. The kitchenette was fully equipped with a microwave, stove elements, kettle, toaster, dishes and cutlery plus sink to clean up. A nice sized table and 2 chairs provided eat-in space. We asked for #6 which as twin beds and a balcony - we enjoyed sunny and warm weather when we stayed so the balcony was a real plus. The beds were very comfortable and housekeeping was done daily. As in many European countries, facecloths are not provided - so bring your own if you require. I bought tablet type ones (8) at the dollar store in Ottawa, which expanded when water was added, and they worked fine. The bathroom in #6 is a single pre-cast plastic unit and a bit small but worked just fine for us - very efficient.The staff were all very polite, friendly and helpful and checked the web for directions and made reservations for us. The office has a computer for use by guests. Behind the office is a beautiful garden for all the nearby residents. Ask the staff to unlock the garden gate for you and wander around. I took lots of photos of the flowers and enjoyed the quiet and solitude.Astons Apartments, 31 Rosary Gardens in South Kensington is well located - less than a 5 minute walk to the Gloucester Road underground station and has nearby grocery stores - the large Waitrose (with lots of wine as well) and the Tesco which is open later. Royal Albert Hall is within 15-20 minutes walking distance - we attended the Peace One Day Gala on Sept. 21. Also, the Original Hop On Hop Off bus stops right in front of Rydges Hotel on Gloucester and their competitor the Big Bus stops near the underground station. For car lovers - there is a Ferrari dealship right at the end of the block and a Maserati parks in the area. I had to have my photo taken standing beside it!!!There are great restaurants near Astons which you can walk to in less than 5 minutes - several Indian ones and a nice pub but make a reservation especially if you are eating after 8 pm. We ate at Kare Kare on Old Brompton Road which had great seafood prepared Indian style. The Cafe Forum on Gloucester Rd. has good coffee and croissants and the Fish &amp; Chip place across the street has ...delicious fish and chips. We also picked up prepared food - fresh and frozen at Waitrose and Australian and NZ white wine (cheaper than in Ontario) - to eat in.I would definitely stay at Astons Apartments again.Karen MacLaurinOttawa, ON Canada"
21,529,Sep 22 2008 	Great	We stayed in room 38 it was roomy the beds were great plenty of room all around. Great location also.
22,529,"Sep 1 2008 	Loved the Manager but not Aston Apartments	Hi there, we stayed (2 adults one child ) one night at Astons recently...and I am glad it was only one night. We were booked to stay at (Base2stay) just a few blocks away in a lovely little residential neigbhourhood but they couldn't accommodate us for one night (Saturday).There are no lifts at Astons...so if you have heavy cases - you may have to lift them up many flights of stairs (like we did) depending on where you stay in the complex - (although we had lots of offers from the staff to help). The apartments are old and tired and in need of a new renovation in my opinion. Ours which was in the main building was #3 (a triple) and although clean and tidy...the bathroom was sooooo musty that I couldn't even stand it long enough to take a shower in it so I washed my hair in the kitchen sink. (I'll try to post pictures of the bathroom so you can see how small it is and yes the shower is only separated from the toilet by a curtain as you will see) The kitchenette is quite adequate and we made good use of it . The beds were a little worn out and I felt like I was listing to one side but my daughter was comfortable in hers apparently... We were also next to the main door so it was noisy when people were coming in late as the door would slam each time. (Bring earplugs...I recommend them if you are a light sleeper) We were shown 3 rooms before we found one suitable...and only charged a small fee for the upgrade from a double to a triple..... Astons has a quaint little courtyard that all can use but you need to contact management to get access as you can't access with your key.Rick Patterson the Manager at Astons couldn't do enough for us though - he is such a gentleman....I hope someone steals him for an upscale hotel somewhere and pay him appropriately for his exellent service and people skills........Check-in was fast and efficient as was checkout. (Keep in mind you will have to pay a 30 pd. damage deposit which is not charged to your visa but an impression of it is taken of your card and the amount is filled in should there be any damage I guess...) You get the copies returned to you when you leave. We also requested a hair dryer, iron and ironing board which we rec'd promptly. A word of caution....watch the rooms in the front upper floors with the balcony as you may share it with another room as we saw we might have....the bloak next door on the 3rd floor of another building (possible resident?) was a chain smoker and we saw a pile of cigerettes on his terrace that you could fill a 2 litre ice-cream container....(no exaggeration!) it was so gross...we imagined ourselves not being able to leave our windows open at night (there is no air-conditioning at Astons....) If you are on a tight budget, then these apartments are adequate but because of the must and carpeted areas - if you are sensitive to smells, (noise) or have allergies - I don't recommend Astons. You will love this area of London though as you are a short walk to two grocery stores (Sainsbury's and Tesco) and lots of little shops and excellent restaurants. The tube is a 3 minute walk as well to Earl's court. I recommend this area for a stay in London."
23,529,Jul 24 2008 	Avoid Astons Apartments	I would avoid this place. Although London apartments can be expensive this is not good value for money. The rooms are poky and its really fun carrying your luggage up 5 flights of stairs. The walls are paper thin so you hear all the noise from other rooms. There are many better places in a similar area in London.
24,529,"May 3 2008 	Solid Service Perfect Location Very Clean	i'm not really sure what the people are complaining about. It seems that sometimes we Americans are a bit picky or depressive when it comes to accomodations in 'old europe.' the UK is not the US. I have been staying at the Astons Apartments since 2004 or 2005. I have never been disappointed. The studios are small. If you stay in a single in a hotel the room would be even smaller. Since I am a petite person, the set up was perfectly fine for me. There was a flat screen (space saving) television and I like that items in the kitchen are on a timer to conserve energy. and my room was clean and the room was serviced daily. it is one of the best locations in the city for getting a feel for both how a resident lives while simultaneously being within walking distance or a short tube ride where ever you would like to go.my particular apartment this time around had a nice balcony. i really enjoyed my stay. but perhaps it is not for everyone."
25,529,"May 1 2008 	Evil management Unsafe Claustrophobic	Hotels in central London can be a SHOCK!This place was booked online from India. Upon arrival I found that the single rooms are quite claustrophobic... to the point of being unsafe. This is a typical Victorian era building converted into a hotel. In an area less than 10 x 10 sq. feet, They have managed to install a bed, a kitchenette &amp; a readymade installable bathroom. Then room had a big window that wasnt airtight... so cold air kept coming in all through the night. There was no air conditiner in the room either. The bathroom is like a candle case... if you have to bath you couldnt come out clean without having to scrub your body against the walls and the curtains. I really wonder if this place is upto fire safety standards and hotel standards of London. Or does the London government allow anything to spring up anywhere without reason or bounds?On complaining, I was moved from a depressing basement room to a room on the first floor. This room was lobby shaped with a higher ceiling and the typical french-style glass panelled door that opened into a common balcony shared with two other lobby like rooms. Now, this isnt safe either. Also, to be safe from potentially unsafe neighbours, you have to keep the door closed! Again no air conditioner to condition the air.I found the management to be shrewd and uncooperative. Their attitude seemed to convey the sentiment... &quot;Hard luck... we fooled you online!&quot;I had to curtail my stay in this place and move to a better place, for which I had to give a tall notice of 7 days, which means I was stuck! Of course I was given the option to move to a larger claustrophobic room at about double the rate. On the day I was leaving, at about 9:30 am, I completed the checkout procedure. There was only one person in the office and no concierge facility. While checking me in the same boy at the desk quickly moved my luggage to the room. But when I was leaving he didnt have time for me. There are no lifts in the building. He curtly asked me to request the laundry people to bring my luggage down. Hapless, I did and they politely refused. I went back to the office, and this time he asked me to ask the cab driver to bring the luggage down. The cabbie obliged.In having the cabbie bring my luggage down, the hotel official was not present, and the key was left behind in my hand. By the time I checked into the new hotel I was quite late for work. As Astons was farther from the tube station, but only two blocks away from the new hotel, I took a liberty; I left the key with the new hotel and called Astons up on reaching my office with a request to pick up the key, purely as a courtesy on my own behalf. They threatened me - &quot;Deposit the key personally by 12pm or they would charge my credit card with 50 pounds&quot;. (They had taken a deposit CC authorization from me &quot;in case I damaged the TV&quot;. I had taken it back while checking out, still the threatened). With no choice I returned them the key personally. I asked him how they would have charged my card. He said.. &quot;I couldnt. But this way I got you to bring the key back. Thank you very much&quot;. So that was my experience. I may have been naive, but the basic point is that the minds of the manager and the staff they have employed are full of malice and extremely uncourteous. And I think the hotel is unsafe. The neighbouring hotel costed only a few pounds higher and had space challenges, but they were very courteous and well managed! I am considering forwarding this to the local municipal authority, even after such a long time has elapsed. One may think why I am doing it now; but the Astons experience is so prominent in my mind. They deserve this! This hotel is cheapskate inside. So be it. But the customer should not be fooled into a cheapskate residence. I even think that I wouldnt have thought so much about this place had I been just passing through London and staying only for a day, but I was there to stay for long, and Astons sold the room to us knowing fully well that they are not equipped to provide for basic services."
26,529,"Apr 14 2008	Unbelievable Value 9n Central London - The Astons Apartments	Unbelievable value in central London  The Astons ApartmentsHaving spent a delightful week at the Astons Apartments last summer I had no problem in making the choice to stay there a second time; this time for over a month in January and February, 2008. The most compelling reasons for such an easy choice of place to stay in London are: 1) the Astons extremely considerate staff 2) the location and3) the compact, self-contained, well-organized, economical accommodation.1  The staff, including the efficient, knowledgeable and courteous manager, the three diligent, considerate and enthusiastic duty managers and the very accommodating maid service, added to the quality of my stay in London. Any enquiry or need covering any aspect of my stay in London was appropriately addressed with speed and alacrity, and always, with a genuine warmth.2 The location: Astons Apartments is comprised of a few terraced houses set in a superb central, very safe location in cosmopolitan South Kensington, nestled amidst private schools, museums, parks, restaurants and fashionable shops. After just a few minutes walk one arrives at Gloucester Road tube station with its three lines  Piccadilly, District and Central  delivering one to any point in London with speed. The West End - home to many theatres and varied attractions - is just a few stops away on the tube.Also at Gloucester Road tube station there is a Waitrose grocery store, a 24 hour Tesco grocery store and many, many varieties of restaurants, shops and pubs nearby offering choice galore. Just a few minutes walk further along on the Cromwell Road is a large Sainsburys grocery store. These British grocery stores carry a tremendous variety of foods, many of them specializing in foods for the discerning palette, as well as the intolerant intestine. Kensington High Street, 10-15 or so minutes walk away, offers entrance to Kensington Palace Gardens (Lady Di interests); the Rooftop Gardens open to the public (call ahead); The Royal Albert Hall presenting a variety of spectacles, along with the many more very fine attractions. Hyde Park has an entrance off Kensington High Street and close-by Kensington Church Street has many fine antiques. The Victoria &amp; Albert museum, along with the British History Museum, is just a short walk away, and the world-renowned Harrods of Knightsbridge is about 20-30 minutes walk away. There are many buses traveling along all of these routes, as well as the underground, not to mention an abundance of highly efficient, reasonably priced taxis. Also within walking distance - about 25-35 minutes - is the famous Notting Hill antique market at Portobello Road on Saturday mornings  not to be missed! And, of course, many, many more exciting attractions, too numerous to list.3  the accommodation: - the concealed kitchen houses a microwave, kettle, stovetop, sink, drainage area doubling as countertop, a selection of pots, cutlery, glassware and crockery, a garbage area underneath the sink, alongside an ample sized fridge underneath the countertop, and an exhaust system to carry away any cooking fumes. The doors can be closed on any mess, instantly removing it from sight and the maid service will clean it all up! The compact bathroom, in the room with an efficient exhaust system, allows for privacy in this economic situation.Bearing in mind that this is a most desirable area of central London, with ease of access to all points of interest, one would be most prudent in staying at the Astons on a London visit where own shopping and cooking allows for a most unique economic central London experience. Although the office is open only from 8.00am till 9.00pm daily, there is always a duty manager available 24/7.One could be forgiven for questioning the existence of such unbelievable value. To get all of this for a stint away from home in central London  along with a balcony if one is on the 1st floor at the front  is a great deal indeed. For all 3 reasons mentioned, I will hope for vacancies at the Astons on my future visits to London, and I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends."
27,529,"Feb 18 2008	Happy to have stayed in Rosary Gardens	Just back from a stay at Astons - not the first time I've done so - and once again very pleased with my time there. The studios, flats and common areas are kept very clean, and staff were pleasant and helpful. The studios for one are small: very small, in fact, almost disconcertingly so. But with wonderful high ceilings for lots of light and all of London on one's doorstep, the small rooms can be forgiven.The washrooms are tiny, and there aren't lifts in the buildings, which some may view as a downside to a stay at Astons. I decided to take those things as part of choosing to stay, and planned accordingly. Gloucester Road station is no more than a five minute walk away, Sainsbury's is about a seven minute walk, so as a pied-a-terre it suited me just fine.Some travellers may need to adjust their expectations, but Astons does what it is supposed to do, and for that I am very grateful."
28,529,"Feb 2 2008 	Dirty bathroom basement room.	Astons has a decent location near the Gloucester Road tube, and makes an effort to make the decor of their rooms cheerful. Our room had a tiny, recently renovated bathroom. This is where the positive points, however, ended for us. We were assigned a room below ground level, basically in the basement, with a view of a dirty alley. The ground level on the streets is higher than the back of the buildings, so this could be called a &quot;garden&quot; apartment, but it's depressing and not where I wanted to stay on my vacation. The bathroom sink drain also had hair from an previous resident. I would never stay here again, even if offered a room on a higher floor. They should have told us before we paid that we would be in the basement."
29,529,"Dec 4 2007	Dreadful	Location is great - max 10 min walking to Gloucester Rd - that is where the good news ends. The reservation was made by telephone rather than internet to specifically reserve a ground floor room (because we couldn't manage the stairs and there is no lift), however, upon check-in were given options of upstairs or downstairs. Our reservation was ignored. No accommodation was made for our special needs upon checkin nor for any of the other four nights. Furthremore: The room reeked of curry. The tea kettle was broken, requested new one and it was not proivded. There is, in fact, no satellite TV and the first remote didn't work, requested a new one and the second one also didn't work. The towel heater doesn't work either. The clock /alarm clock buttons don't function - time is always three hours late.I would not recommend staying here. There are numerous other self catering apartments within easy access of Earl's Court and Gloucester Rd for the same rate and better chances for decent accommodation (or at least that which is advertised)."
30,529,"Nov 13 2007 	Fantastic Location	First of all the hotel is fantastically situated. Just 3/4 minutes walk to Gloscester road tube station. That tube station is located in zone 1 and has 3 lines passing by. Just great.The hotel it self was nice. we stayed in the last floor, and we found a very clean room with a very well equipped kitchenette. Didn't like the bathroom so much, but have to admit that it did serve every of your needs.So, next time i'm in London i will check Aston apartments availability first. It's a great value for price."
31,529,"Oct 18 2007 	Great Location but in need of renovation	Aston Apartments are in a great location in South Kensington on a quiet residential street. 5 minutes walk to Gloucester Road underground.My husband, son and I had a &quot;family&quot; apartment which was on the lower (basement level). It had a large window and was very bright and an outside stairway access into the apartment.It was smaller than we expected. It was damp and smelled musty. The beds and linen were clean. The kitchen area was adequate and moderately equipped. The bathroom was very small and damp.These apartments could be great if they were upgraded especially the kitchen and bathroom. The photos on the website make it look grander than it is.Staff were very helpful and polite.Would I stay here again? Maybe. Hotel accommodation is very expensive in London and this was adequate for a short stay. If you are looking for 3 star plus accommodation, this isn't it."
32,529,"Sep 20 2007 	Very disappointing!	Stayed in an &quot;Executive&quot; double room at the Astons Apartments recently. We arrived full of expectation but were soon to realise that it was not what we hoped for. The check in area was a messy room at the back of the ground floor - no great welcome. The door to our &quot;apartment&quot; was chipped and had been patched up in a number of places but not repainted - not a good start! Really the only compliments I can think of were the location and that the room was very quiet, looking out onto a pleasant garden.The room was tiny - there was hardly room to walk around the end of the bed and defintely not what I would call an apartment. The kitchenette facilities were basic and set up in what was really the only cupboard. There was no plug for the sink and although I asked each morning we never saw one. When we arrived there was a THICK layer of grease in the sink and also on the back ot the dinner plates - obviously the last guests roast dinner! There was virtually no space for clothes or suitcases. There was a tiny cupboard to hang clothes but very awkward to access. We had to leave our suitcase under the table.We booked a double room but had 2 single beds pushed together. The mattresses were very lumpy and the springs could be felt every time you moved. The sheets looked like they had been recycled from the local hospital, in fact one pillow case had a hospital logo on it. The pillows were old and stained and only had one slip over them. Theblankets were synthetic and very worn looking. The carpet was rippledand literally worn through in a number of places.The bathroom was miniscule and when the window was opened looked ontoa window sill with paint peeling off in big chunks. There was hardly any grout left between the floor tiles, so to clean the bathroom was impossible. There was also general grottiness in the corners of the bathroom.The whole place looked and felt like a hostel except it was nearly $400 a night.We would NEVER stay at the Aston Apartments again."
33,529,"Jun 27 2007 	Lovely location!	I'm really much more of a pampered hotel traveller but I loved this experience. Yes it is like staying in a studio apartment complete w/mini kitchen so it would be perfect for longer stays. I was there for only one night but wished it was longer, facing the courtyard/Mews I felt like one of the locals for just a minute.The staff was helpful and funny when she apologized for giving me an &quot;upgrade&quot; (which meant putting me in the top floor room...70 steps, no elevator). Older travellers might want to ask for a lower floor.The room was not very modern but everything worked and overall very comfortable."
34,529,"Jun 21 2007 	Great location	The apartments are basic but clean and comfortable and very quiet. The kitchenette was very handy and helped to save costs of always eating out. The bathroom (including toilet) was very very small (tiny) but adequate. If you need a larger bathroom you might want to consider upgrading to the next size room. The location of the apartments was the main drawcard for us. It was very close to the tube (Glouscester Road) and was on the hop on/hop off bus route and also the normal bus route. The train from Heathrow Airport delivers you direct to the Glouscester Road Station then its a 3-5 minute walk to the hotel. The local shops included two supermarkets, banks, foreign exchange outlets and many pubs and cafe's. It was in easy walking distance to many museums including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace and gardens."
35,529,"Jun 10 2007	Cheaper than most London hotels!	I often stay at the Astons, as it is (for central London) extremely cheap! The rooms are small, and basic, but it is beautifully located in the heart of South Kensington, It is completely self-catering, which suits me fine, although that might not be everyone's preference. The only problem that bugs me is the complete lack of elevator! In the past, if I have had a very heavy suitcase, one of the guys at the front desk has helped me, and I tip them....that's the only way around that problem, really. Worth mentioning that the service is very friendly indeed, which often makes up for the lack of elevator and totally unreliable WiFi connections!"
36,529,"Apr 7 2007 	Pretend to be Wealthy	Wouldnt it be brilliant to have a smart flat in a very exclusive London neighborhood (Kensington for example)? Well, if you are anything like me you have no chance of ever affording that - but you can pretend for a few days by staying at the Astons. For about $300 a night you can essentially get a very small apartment on a tony London street with a Ferrari dealership at one end. Paradoxically, with the average London meal at the $100 mark you can actually save money by eating in using the small but functional kitchen. Our apartment was in need of a couple of handyman visits and the shower was so small enough that once you dropped the soap it was irretrievable but otherwise no complaints."
37,529,"Jan 26 2007 	Go for the executive	I chose this property after reviewing a number of listings in TripAdvisor. I would pretty much agree with what other writers have noted. I happened to stay in a &quot;double&quot; that was non-executive and, while comfortable for 1, would have been cramped for 2. The neighbourhood is wonderful - quiet and conveniently close to a number of amenities and attractions. If you're a fan of Indian food, you must eat at Noor Jahan - just a short walk away. The staff were friendly and all, but I question the value. The sheet on the bed was torn, there was no bottle opener or corkscrew in the kitchenette and only one wine glass (one would think that you'd want to share, if you're staying in a &quot;double&quot;!). I think I'll look elsewhere in my continuing pursuit of good value in Knightsbridge!"
38,529,"Jan 5 2007	Great area. Not problem solvers	Have stayed there in 2003 and again in Dec 06Excellent location - well-to-do area close and safe enough to go for a jog in Hyde park - right in the middle of everything London.Very reasonable price for area. Tiny rooms but clean. But no shampoo or conditioner in bathroom - and only 1 hand towel (no hand towel or face cloth).When problems arose, staff was pleasant but problems not solved. Had confirmed ahead of time there would be wireless in room - Got there and it wasn't working - had to go to room in separate building in day until finally got wireless in room. Room was quiet until house beside had lovely blaring party till 5:00 AM - could not obtain help from hotel."
39,529,"Dec 17 2006	Still in Love with SW7--thank you Astons!	Ditto to the previous reviewer--for those of us who are on the road frequently, Astons is really a welcome change from our favorite haunts in and around the Capital, especially after arriving after an excruciating work week &amp; transatlantic flight (although AA136/137--LAX/LHR is what I consider one of the more pleasant ways to get across the pond) for a long weekend/R&amp;R. You will not find room service or lifts; but what you will find is an exceedingly clean, quiet and comfortable property in an excellent residential setting in South Kensington. I stayed in an executive studio double (no. 27) three flights up, with a fascinating couryard view; the fully-equipped galley is actually the reason I stay at Astons; it's SO convenient to have coffee in the morning immediately on waking, without waiting for room service or leaving your room . . . and also to eat in at night as an option from restaurants and take away. For those not accustomed to European standards, be aware that the square footage is not extravagant, but for this part of town, Astons is a remarkable value! The shower offers adequate pressure, although the lighting in the bath area could be improved around the mirror area; the bedside lighting is also not the brightest. Staff is unfailing polite (and attractive); if you want to feel at home in one of the most exciting cities in the world, consider Astons--you won't be disappointed!"
40,529,"Oct 29 2006 	Extraordinarily convenient - but go Executive not Standard	I have been staying at Astons 4 nights a week, on and off, since 2003.There are many hotels in London that are more luxurious, if you want to pay twice the price; or you can pay the same price and enter the great London lottery to see just how small, noisy and depressing a hotel room can be.What keeps me coming back to Astons week after week are:1. Independence - the kitchenettes are tiny but well equipped, and free you from the hassle of dining out every night.2. Convenience - 5 minutes from Gloucester Road station and the Circle, District and Piccadilly lines; 45 minutes walk from Victoria.3. Room size - I've cooked a dinner for my visiting brother, done hours of work on my laptop. The executive rooms are very practical spaces, and most have acces to the wireless LAN.The things that bug me are:1. Lack of aircon - but this is a general complaint with London hotels under the 100 mark (and many over it).2. Lack of a lift - it's no joke dragging everything up 7 flights of stairs to the topmost rooms.Astons reception closes at 21:00; you can still get in by buzzing the bell but you can't then pay until the next morning. I've always found the people in reception to be friendly and personable - again, not at all a 'given' in London hotels.For me, the key to a happy stay in Astons is to book an Executive room. The standard rooms are mostly poky and depressing; they are always less well decorated."
41,529,"Oct 11 2006 	Great location Good value for money	Excelent location, 2 minutes from Gloucester Road subway station (3 lines). Not large room and tiny bathroom but very clean and with a very functional kitchenette.Very friendly staff.Good value for money paid"
42,529,"Oct 7 2006 	quaint charming and convenient Aston's Apratments	Having spent many hours researching comfy accomodations to fit our criteria, I settled on our weeks stay at Astons Apartments in London, England. A two minute walk from Gloucester Road tube, a charming South Kensington (SW7) neighborhood with lots of amenities, the convenience was surpassed by Aston's accomodations. They have a few buildings that offer two levels of studios; the standard and the executive. We opted for the executive as they advertise on their site a larger bathroom and somewhat larger studios. It really felt like living in London and what with the dollar against the pound, we saved money on making our own breakfast and occasional dinners in the mini kitchen alcove. We shopped at the Gloucester mall right at the tube stop, for all our groceries at Waitrose, a very complete grocery store stocked with fresh produce, meats, seafood, a nice wine selection and all the baked goods, prepared foods and other items one would expect in a major high end grocery store in the states. We frequented two pubs in the neighborhood The Hereford and Stanhope Arms, both on Gloucester Road, the later of which is a bus stop for the tour bus called Big Bus. It operates 7 days a week from 8:30 ish to 5 ish and a bus stops in front of the pub every 15 to 20 minutes. Cost: 20 pounds person but Aston's offers it for 17 pounds. One can hop on and off as frequently as desired as the ticket is good for the entire day. This bus gives one a good overview of London and the entire trip takes about 3 hours, round trip. Our favorite site was Westminster Abbey followed by The Churchill War Room and Museum, walking distance from one another. We also frequent Las Vegas and enjoy gaming so we were delighted to discover (after some online research) two casinos in the neighborhood. The Grosvenor Casino one block away, then one on Cromwell Road across from the Natural History Museum, next to Victoria and Albert Museum-all in walking distance. All this information can be found through your favorite search engine including amenities, attractions, restaurants etc. near each tube staion in London. One word of warning: there is no lift at Aston's 31 Rosary Garden address and we were in room 16, charming and private but 6 flights up. Secondly, we had a problem with Hotel Link, the airport transportation service Aston's reccommended. We waited 45 minutes for them at the airport then they never showed up for our return trip although we pre paid. Aston's graciously ordered a cab and picked up the expense. The tube goes right from Heathrow to Gloucester Road and with rolling luggage, the two minute walk should not be a problem. Enjoy and cheerio!"
43,529,"Aug 17 2006	Super location...	We stayed in the Astons Apartments for a week in July 2006. This was the week that London had the hottest temperatures on record!!! So if you wish to stay at the Astons Apartments , stay away from the hot summer months because the apartments do not have any A/C (which is not uncommon in London) however, there was not even a fan. Aside from that, the apartment (a Deluxe Suite) was quite small (it looks bigger on the web site!)but functional. The shower was good, lots of hot water. It was clean and there is daily maid service. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The best thing about the Astons is its fantastic location in a lovely residential district in South Kensington - nice and quiet. You can walk to the subway station within 5 minutes and there is a good grocery store right beside the subway station. Only have one negative comment (besides the heat!!). We could not use the hot water faucet in the kitchen sink (it sprayed sideways); we told the staff about it twice, but it never did get fixed, so we had to wash our dishes in the bathroom. Advice to Astons: it would be nice if there was a lamp on the dining table, and fix that darn faucet!!!The Altmann's from Canada"
44,529,"Aug 2 2006	Astons Apartments London - not up to expectations	We booked a standard double and paid 95  per night for 4-night stay. The room was adequate, though small by any standard. Maid service was very good. Cleanliness good. However, having a fitted carpet in a room where you (are supposed to be able to) cook is NOT a sensible choice.Cupboard space tiny, and not easily accessible (only one narrow door for a cupboard twice the width). The alarm clock did not work and mentioning this to staff did not get a follow-up.  I did not expect more of the kitchenette (which did contain all the basics, even a microwave) although I cannot imagine actually preparing even a basic meal, other than reheating something.I would not book there again, the main reason being the less than basic bathroom, more of a 1.2m/1.2 m cubicle, containing shower, toilet and wash basin. It was impossible to ventilate properly. Only solution : leave the door open ... In a caravan this would be acceptable but these are flats...I felt cheated for the price.( Review by mother and daugher - frequent London visitors )"
45,529,"Jun 29 2006	Not worth the trouble and the money you pay...	I stayed here during one of my business trips.Firstly, the quoted price, and the price charged were different.Secondly, The accomopation ( it was said that the room I stayed in was a Studio Suite) was less than a standard room you would get in an average 4 star hotel. The room was old and tired, it desparately needed refubishment. There are no ACs so your garauteed to have sleepless nights in the summer time when the weather is hot. The rooms andthe kitchentte was not very clean...I found someone else's body hair in my sheets!!!!!If your going to stay around this area you can find hotels of much higher standards for the same price."
46,529,"Jun 22 2006	Great location	Astons is easy access from Heathrow by train and easy 5 mins walk, dragging the cases, from Gloucester Road station. The reception did not open until 8.00am which wasn't a problem for us but maybe a watchpoint for someone else.We had booked through British Airways and requested a non-smoking room. The terrace where our room was to be reeked of smoke. The standard room was small, dark and depressing. The bathroom and kitchenette little built ins to the room. We had expected small but this was horrible.We asked to see a better room and ended up paying an extra 10 pounds per night for a deluxe room. Well worth it. The room was at rear of the house, 3rd floor, overlooking gardens, private, very quiet and an adequate size. The bathroom was separate and a good size. The built in kitchenette had kettle. toaster, 2 plate burner, fridge, good sink but no microwave. Although Astons told us they do not provide non smoking rooms, after the initial experience I didn't smell any smoke. I understand the twin standard rooms are larger than the standard doubles and open to small balconies at front of the terraces. Worth checking out.From there on the stay was great. Fabulous location. Near to the station and a lovely area to stroll around in the evening. The rooms were well serviced but may be warm in high summer (fans provided). My husband is still raving about what a good supermarket/deli Waitrose is, a rare find in England. Great cafes and Pauls (near station) make excellent baguettes and cakes.We would recommend Astons but not their standard double rooms."
47,529,"Jun 1 2006	A great value	We found Astons Apartments a great value, but agree that realistic expectations are key. The room is small, but larger and better kept than several New York hotels we've stayed at. And if you plan to use the room for much more than sleeping and dressing, you need to take a closer look at Time Out London. The bathroom is a bit of a challenge, comparable to what you'd find in a tight ship's cabin. We appreciated the kitchenette: With it and several nearby supermarkets, you can compose a much better breakfast than anything you'd get from a European hotel in this price range. Location is great. Gloucester Road underground stop is three blocks away and provides easy connections to Heathrow and most London attractions and theater. Plenty of restaurants, shops and the like in the area."
48,529,"Mar 27 2006 	Realistic expectations are the key..	If you approach a booking here with a few points in your mind you'll have no problems. We booked a double deluxe suite for just 80 pounds - this is one of the prime tourist areas of the city and a price like that represents an incredible bargain for the quality of accommodation offered. I've paid more than twice the amount for a room less than half the size in a hotel just round the corner. What you will get for your money is essentially a moderate sized hotel room with a TV, a comfortable bed, a clean and acceptably sized but basic bathroom (ours looked just a bit tired, but you're not going to spend your life in there) and a useful kitchenette area behind foldaway doors. You won't get a whole hotel suite in the sense of numerous separate rooms - but for 80 pounds in central SW London that's hardly a sensible expectation. Reception was courteous and helpful - public areas clean and perfectly presentable. No noise problems. The area is quiet and safe and well supplied with pleasant bars and restaurants -transport links are excellent too. Useful extra services like airport shuttle, free internet access for two hours in the evening and a cheap laundry service are also available. There's no food at all, but numerous possibilities (including a 24 hr supermarket) are within three minutes' walk. A key deposit of 30 pounds is taken (this information was posted on the website through which we booked). If you want a room big enough for two people to watch TV in for 8 hours a day without getting in each other's way, then pay more money and go elsewhere. If you want a pleasant, clean and convenient base from which to do more exciting and worthwhile things before returning in the evening to sleep and maybe cook a meal (another big saving, remember) it's an absolute steal for the price. On that basis - very highly recommended."
49,529,"Mar 4 2006	Perfect spot	Astons was great! Yes the shower abuts the toilet and it gets slightly wet; yes the room was small, but I'm there as a tourist, to sightsee, not to spend the better part of my day in my room. It's in a great location. Tesco and Waitrose are only a few blocks away, so shopping for food was easy. The kitchen is basic, but it gets the job done! I highly recommend it. The room was quiet, even though it was right by the stairs. (please note, no elevator, but really not an issue). The staff/concierge were great as well. I'll go back if I can."
50,529,"Jan 6 2006	Small Room Horrible Bathroom But Great Location	I know European hotel rooms are often smaller than what Americans are used to, so I wasn't surprised by our cramped quarters at the Astons. However, the bathroom was so small that there wasn't even enough room to hang up towels; the ledge over the basin jutted out so far it was difficult to wash; the basin had two separate faucets for hot and cold water, which resulted in scalding if you held your hand over the hot water; and the shower, basin, and toilet were so close together that moving around was uncomfortable. The room came with utensils and a refrigerator, which were helpful given that London restaurant prices are so high we sometimes bought groceries and ate them in the room (note: a 24 hour grocery is nearby).Tne neighborhood is quiet and attractive, and best of all-as other reviewers have said--is the proximity to the Gloucester Road underground station, only two blocks away. However, given the bathroom problems, I don't think I would stay here again."
51,529,"Dec 29 2005	Great apartments!	We stayed at Astons Apartments for a couple of nights after Christmas and found it to be a terrific place to stay! There are so many choices in London, many of them of poor standards but we found that the rooms, although not huge, were the right size for two adults. The service at reception was friendly and helpful, the rooms were extremely clean (and the daily maid service was excellent).The location was excellent and the neighbourhood was quiet - I've never slept so well in London before!"
52,529,"Dec 5 2005	Bathroom--small!	The best thing about the Astons is its great location (a short walk from Gloucester Road Tube stop in Kensington); and the accomodations are not terrible. The bathroom, however, was ridiculously, laughably small. The toilet was practically *in* the &quot;shower.&quot; (See pic.)"
53,529,"Dec 2 2005	Astons apartments - a great London stay	I have stayed at Astons apartments, Rosary Gardens, London on 2 occasions. My husband and I stayed there in 2004 and I liked it so much, I returned in Sept. 2005 with a female friend for a week. The rooms are super clean, with a small kitchenette, with plates, tea kettle, etc. We stayed in a back room overlooking the garden - very quiet, and had a hugh bathroom by european standards. The area was great--3 blocks from Gloucester Rd. tube station, all sorts of good pubs in the area (try the Hereford Arms) and a Starbucks, and large grocery store just beside the tube station. South Kensington is a good area, just south of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. You may walk there if you're in good shape to walk. The staff at Astons were SUPERB! Very friendly and accomodating. Do stay at Astons the next time your go to London! The price is good, also. You won't regret it."
54,529,"Oct 31 2005	Wretched	Rooms absolutely tiny, no elevator (and long staircases to drag your luggage up), bathroom facilities beyond basic, beds way past their prime. If you like bedsprings sticking in your back, a bathroom fan that makes more noise than a locomotive, no place to open your suitcase, having to ask several times for every basic request, then stay here. I'd recommend staying almost anyplace else, except for the great location."
55,529,"Oct 24 2005	Simply a jewel!	I stayed at Astons' for 4 nights during the summer. Bringing 2 kids with me to &quot;see the best of London&quot;, I found Astons a very pleasant place to stay, with a great location --just a 10 minute walk (even for young children) from the tube station; the museums and Hyde Park within walking distances, and convenient shops for food nearby. There is also an internet bar down the main road. I was pleasantly surprised that the apartment was in a very quiet neighbourhood, so we could actually have very quiet evenings and undisturbed nights. We are Chinese from Hong Kong, so staying 4 days in London meant that my kids missed all the homemade delicacies. The kitchenette in the room solved all the problems, with well-equipped sinks, pots and pans, crockery and utensils, plus a good sized fridge and microwave, stove -- you name it! What better things can you expect when you are thousands of miles away from home! To make it even better, the dirty pans and dishes were all cleaned up during the daily service!! Considering it was in central London, the room price was moderate, and the room size was OK for 1 adult + 2 kids. Any extra person would make the room feel crowded. The bathroom,however, was bigger than I expected and fitted with modern fixtures, but no tub in our room. I was satisfied with the cleanliness and the service of the room, even the hallway and stairs were clean and brightly decorated, though not on a luxurious scale. The staff were friendly enough though not much could be expected for sightseeing guidance. There was no air-conditioning in the room but the summer nights were cool enough. There was no elevator so it would be quite demanding if you have lots of heavy baggage. This apartment-hotel is highly recommended for family vacations, especially if you are thinking of cooking your own meals, which also helps with the budget. I would stay there again next time I visit London."
56,529,"Oct 9 2005	Think small; think miniature	I asked the young fellow who checked me in, Why do you call them apartments and not flats?He said, Because theyre smaller than flats.Truer words were never spoken.My single studio room was #45 in Building 39. It was a very small, narrow room with a high ceiling. I had to reach it by stairs, as there was no lift. It took me a good day to adjust to the tightness of the quarters and to shake the P.O.W. feeling it gave me. The bed was twin size. The closet was twelve inches wide-----yes, inches. There was a small rotating fan on the floor. The balcony appeared to be openly shared by two other apartments. I was mindful of keeping my balcony doors locked.There was a kitchen sink, a stove top, refrigerator, toaster, and microwave oven all in a compact area in my room. I liked brewing my own tea in the morning and having a tray of ice cubes handy in the refrigerator.I couldnt imagine bringing bags of groceries into such a small space and preparing full meals.I asked for a wake-up call. It never came. I asked for an iron and an ironing board. They never came.There was an alarm clock/radio in the room, but no place to plug it in unless I unplugged the television (which I did).The bathroom was very tiny. It was impossible to shave or wash my face over the little dollhouse sink without spilling water on the floor and soaking the bathroom tissue. Water pressure in the shower was okay. The water turned cold in the middle of my first shower. The office sent up a maintenance man who immediately fixed the problem. I had hot water for the remainder of my stay.One bath towel per day was provided. If you use hand towels or face cloths, bring your own.Best not to lose that room key. Youll need it to re-enter the building and the office closes at 9:00.Rosary Gardens was a very quiet street. The Gloucester Road tube station was an easy walk away. I walked to the Victoria &amp; Albert museum from Astons.Although it was clean, my room was small to the point of being too small. Impractical, really. My rate was 65 per night + VAT. Total charge for my 3 nights was $416.59 USD. My advice: before booking into Astons look at the Priceline and the Bidding for Travel websites. You might be able to book hotel accommodations that are more liveable and perhaps even at a lower rate than what youll pay at Astons.I exchanged currency at Thomas Exchange Global on Victoria Street. The rate was 55 GBP for 100 USD, with no commission fees. People were queued up on the street waiting to get in there."
57,529,"Sep 5 2005	Great Choice	We stayed for two nights with four people. The apartment (#1) had two twin beds, a sleep sofa and a pull out single. With all the beds out, it was a little cramped, but fine. The bathroom was large and modern. The kitchen was useful, too with a good microwave and ample fridge. Everything was quite clean. Best of all, unit #1 had its own entrance from the street. The staff was very friendly and helpful, allowing us to check in at 11am. The neighborhood is wonderful, the street was VERY quiet, and a short stroll from the Glocester Road tube stop. Two grocery stores nearby and numerous shops with coffee and sandwiches for breakfast. Highly recommended!"
58,529,"Jul 28 2005	Perfect location	My husband, 18 month old daugher and I recently spent five days in London at the Astons Apartments. The room was very small by North American standards but really has all the amenities you need. Our kitchenette was perfect for storing fruit, breakfast and lunch supplies and the bathroom was compact but functionable. The main reason we would stay here again is its location. The apartments are quiet on their residential road but its just a short walk and you are on a busy roadway with cafes, pubs, grocery stores and the Glouchester Road tube station. It was perfect for us!"
59,529,"Jun 30 2005	Cute but Small	Our stay at Astons Apartments was nice. The bathroom was tiny, with a sink that was all but impossible to wash my face in without drenching the floor, however, the shower worked well with plenty of hot water. The rooms are very small, and there are not any dressers to store your clothes. Basic rooms, but nice views of the gardens. The 'kitchen' had everthing you needed, but was also tiny. The staff was helpful and the location was a quiet street, 3 blocks from the tube. A great restaurant nearby is 'BALANS'. We also stayed at the K &amp; K George Hotel in Earl's Court a short distance away, which was larger, cleaner and included a very nice breakfast with the cost of the room."
60,529,"Jun 23 2005 	Astons: Pleasant Quiet Plain	We stayed in a standard double. Small, but not as small as we feared. Submarine-style bathroom was fine by us. Very quiet residential street was a big plus. Nearby tube, restaurants, shopping. Experimental wireless access in main building only-- 5 pounds for entire stay, regardless of length of time. Free access to internet via management's computers during business hours. Helpful, young staff. Only noise problem due to convoluted architecture-- we literally could reach out of our window and touch the windowsills of two other apartments. The noise was not bad in our case (Aston's seems to attract a fairly quiet set of people) but you will be at the mercy of your neighbors, especially if it is warm and you have to leave the windows open for air. No A/C and no cross-ventilation, but small fans provided. Overall, we were pleased and would stay there again."
61,529,"May 14 2005	Perfect for Two	My son and I spent eight nights at the Astons in April 2005, and for us it was perfect. Whether other travellers will give it a high rating will depend on what your priorities are for your stay in London. Our four priorities were:1. Accomodations with a kitchenette. 2. Location in a convenient, centrally-located, pleasant, residential neighborhood3. Reasonable price4. Clean, well maintainedI have always found that having even a modest kitchen facility is a good idea when I travel with children. There's convenience and economy. We like to get an early start, and being able to make eggs, toast, coffee and have a glass of juice quickly does save time. Being able to have a snack at &quot;home&quot; is also a plus. Restaurant prices in London will quickly give you sticker shock. A coffee is typically about $2.50. Simple sandwiches at the many sandwich shops run about $8. Entrees at restaurants, even the more modest ethnic restaurants, pubs, and fish &amp; chips places start at about $16. Buying stuff at the local supermarket made life a lot simpler, in addition to substantial savingsSo, it was nice on occasion to just have a pizza (get a take-out from the pizza restaurant in the arcade adjacent to the Gloucester Road tube or take-out Chinese (there's a good place right outside the South Kensington tube on Thurloe St. or just a good old-fashioned store bought chicken in the room after a long day of sightseeing. Food prices tend to be pretty much as in the States. There's a great, fairly large supermarket in the arcade which will be your regular starting point. A great selection of fresh cheeses, cold cuts, prepared foods and all the rest. About a 10 minute walk west on Cromwell Road as you exit the tube is an even larger Sainsbury supermarket.The kitchenette at Astons is well equipped, better than average, basically a wall section with an electric range, small refrigerator, microwave and supply of glasses, dishes, pots, silverware, other cooking utensils and a cutting board. Two pluses were a toaster and and a French-press for coffee. Dishes were cleaned every day by the housekeeper. There are cleaning supplies if needed. The location for Astons is easily one its best assets on many counts. It's five minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube, which has two major tube lines. It's never very crowded, and, in contrast to many other stations, the different lines are close together. A travel tip --If your're going to be in London for at least four weekdays, definitely get a 7-day Zone 1-2 travel card for both adults and children (bring a small passport size picture need for ID for children).A couple of things to note. If you're planning on taking the tube from Heathrow (an only slightly longer ride than the far more expensive express train, which is actually less convenient for Astons), buy a one day Zone 1-6 card, and get your 7-day card the next day. Also, children ride free on weekend, but they do need to physically have a travel card, even though it's free. A reason reason I chose Astons is that I knew from past travel that South Kensington is one of the nicest neighborhoods in London -- quiet, quaint, residential, which we definitely appreciated after the noise and activity of the sights in Central London.There's a couple of local pubs (you'll pass Hereford Arms (perfect for dinner) and Stanhope Arms on Gloucester Road, near both tube and bus connections (travel cards are for buses also). You're about 10-15 minutes from the Natural History, Science and Victoria &amp; Albert Museums, Harrods and Hyde Park. Also about 10 minutes from Fulham Road, in the other direction, a good place to wander, lots of interested shops, a multitude of ethnic restaurants.Sticker shock will also hit you when you search for places to stay. There are several apartments in S.Ken but they're either much more expensive or cheaper, but far less in other amenities. We did a bit of online searching once we settled on Astons, and found a rate of 76 pounds/night for our 2 single bed studio at londontown.com. Since Astons has a toll-free number that puts you in touch directly with the apartments, we contacted them directly with that price and booked the room. It was nice to be able to talk to someone directly at no cost. When figuring our room rates, remember there's a 17.5% tax added on. Our final bill was about $175/night which met our budget of under $200, not an easy task in London, particularly in a nice area.From the outside, Astons looks similar to all the other row houses on the block. Inside on the entrance floor is the reception office and a small foyer. The office will let you use their internet connection evenings from 6-9pm, which was helpful for booking plans while we were in town. Depending on who's on duty, you can also sometimes use the internet in the morning to check out the weather (basically a useless exercise since the weather is highly changeable from one hour to the next). Our room was 8B, three flights up, facing a garden. Everyone thing is clean and well cared for. The room and bathroom was cleaned daily, beds made, new towels given, dishes washed -- all things we assume but don't always get.Those are the positives, which were important for us. There are, however, a few things that may be an issue for others. The first is that, as others have reported, the rooms are definitely small -- basically just large enough for two beds next to each other, night tables, an eating table with chairs and a tv, that gets only the five basic London &quot;free&quot; channels.For those who need more room to move around (that wasn't one of our concerns since we spent very little non-sleeping time in the room), that might be a problem. There are no bureaus, so our stuff went in either the closet or stayed in suitcases. The bathroom wasn't quite as small as others have suggested, but it was a bit tight and there was no vanity, so toiletries were left at the sink. The shower, also no spacious, but sufficient, worked well (although we did have a problem with hot water the first day.) There's a phone in the room, but you're probably better off giving friends/family the 800 number into the office and letting them connect to your room free of charge (the office does close at 9pm, 4pm NY time).Don't expect any help from the office staff on tourist options -- they were friendly and helpful with room matters, but weren't too knowledgeable about London stuff. So there you have it. For us a great experience. Since we covered London and surrounding with great detail, I'd be happy to share our experiences. Since Trip Advisor was a great help to us, I'm happy to reciprocate."
62,529,"Jan 12 2005	friendly and warm welcome	We arrived to a friendly welcome, unfortunatly our room wasnt ready but we didnt have long to wait . The standard double room is small and an upgrade would be advisable but it does do if you are planning going out for most of your time in London. The area is very clean and tidy and very quite. There are plenty of local shops including a Tesco's if you fancy making yourself a morning bacon sandwich!! There are two or three local pubs about 2 mins walking distance, prices quite reasonable. If you fancy eating out but dont feel like adventuring too far STAY AWAY from the Italians Cafe/Restuarant on the corner, you feel like an outcast and the food well you wouldnt feed it to your worst emery it is a complete rip off stay well away. The nearest station is Gloucester Road and is central for most places. If you fancy a site seeing tour The Big London Bus is the one to use, excellent value, friendly staff and well worth seeing everything.Overall 10/10 for the location, apartments and sites. If your looking for value for money, local amenitites and a quiet area, I would definatly recommend Astons"
63,529,"Oct 4 2004	Loved the Astons Apartments	The Astons Apartments are serviced apartments (i.e. maid service) located 5 minutes just west and north of the Gloucester Road Tube Station. The rooms are small - Remember this is LONDON - all hotel rooms are small, unless you want to pay  per night! The hotel has several buildings on a street of Georgian Row houses. We stayed for four nights in early September (fewer tourists) in building 29, room 28 on the third floor. The room was at the back of the house with a view of the back yard and the backyards of the buildings on the next street. The reception closes at 9:30 p.m. (21h30), and the front desk staff were young and very helpful. There is no internet access here. We booked over the internet with Central London Apartments (www.central-london-apartments.com). The hotel can provide you with a taxi at a fixed-rate to Heathrow Airport, Paddington Station or Waterloo Station (it was 16.00 between Astons Apartments and Waterloo Station). I am sure that this works from the stations and airports to the hotel as well - just ask!!!Our Double Studio (two persons, one double bed) had a bed with a firm mattress, soft sheets and ample pillows. The room also had a hob (this is a stove top with two elements), a small fridge, a sink, a toaster, a kettle and a microwave - as well as all of the necessary cutlery, plates, glasses and utensils (can and bottle openers!!!). With groceries purchased from Waitrose, we spent less on food and had decent meals in our room. We paid 95.18 a night.There was a table with two chairs and a phone (each room has its' own phone number so people can call you directly!! - no charge for incoming calls) and television. The bathroom had a shower (picture an airplane bathroom!), and was built-in to the wall. The place is great for adventurous types. If you are tall or wide, or aren't the adventurous type - stay somewhere else! The room was not air-conditioned, but the large window opened, and it was sufficiently cool at night for sleeping.This is a very safe neighbourhood day or night, with foot patrols by local police. There is a Waitrose grocery store located just beside the Gloucester Road Tube Station (buy your bottled water here - it's 59p as opposed to paying 1.50 at the Tube Station). There are fresh and prepared foods for reasonable prices. Note: a Tesco Metro (groceries) will be opening soon directly across from the Tube Station. There is a good cafe (open late) for coffee and sweet snacks. The neighbourhood has restaurants and small shops, a great pub, a coin laundry (!!!) and a drycleaner, as well as two cash points (bank machines). It is fun to look in the windows of the local real estate offices which have listings of local properties for sale - not that one could afford anything in this area!!We had a great time - and for London, this is a reasonable price to pay for a great little hotel!"
64,529,"Jul 16 2004	Clean and centrally located -	I recently spent 3 days at the Astons Hotel in July '2004. After reading many reviews on hotels I thought this one had the best to offer for the value (59 pounds or $108 a night). I found the room to be quite small but very clean and was perfect if you are traveling alone. I had the standard room and it was good for a single, but for two people you will want the upgrade to a standard suite, ($50 more). The only problem with the room was that the small standard bed was rather uncomfortable. The 3 flights of stairs was good exercise and didn't bother me at all. Best of all the hotel is right in the heart of London, walking distance of Hyde Park and 2 blocks from the underground. Pubs and store galore in nearby Kennsingon. I would go back there again in a heart beat."
65,529,"May 11 2004	Decent Accommodations	We booked here for a recent trip because the rates were good (76 pounds/night) and the location sounded great. The location is not a bad walk (about 5 min) to a Tube station and close to several fine restaurants. But our first room was a closet. The room was barely big enough for the double bed and the bathroom was miniscule (it really is like an airplane bathroom). The sink was so small that you couldn't wash your face in it without dismantling the shelf that hung over it. We upgraded to an executive suite (for another 15 pounds/night) which was a four-floor walkup but had a modern bathroom and shower at least. The room was relatively clean and they changed the sheets and towels daily, though they didn't add more tea or coffee in the kitchenette. (The staff was very nice and probably would have given us more if we had asked, but it was more fun to go shopping for our own.) Unless you're used to staying in hostels, don't even bother with a base model room here. Go straight to the executive rooms and then head down the street to the Hereford Arms pub for a pint."
66,529,"May 1 2004	Too tiny!	I was visiting friends in London and wanted to stay for a week in a serviced apartment. When I arrived, I was told that a deposit would be required (which I wasn't told about when I made the booking nor was it mentioned in their website!). I was truly shocked by the tiny size of the room which therefore made the toilet/bathroom the size of a broom cupboard! If you were taking a shower, you would more than likely hit the toilet seat..... The sink was tinier than those you see in aeroplanes. Despite the high price of nearly 100 (USD 178) per night, furnishings were basic and some things were not working e.g. light in the room had fused, amongst other things. Don't bother to come here if you have luggage. In fact, just don't bother and go check into a hotel where you will at least get some decent facilities for the price."

1,530,"Oct 29 2009 	Astor Court - Its OK would stay again!!	The hotel is very close to Oxford Circus Tube and its location is ideal for Oxford Street, The service from reception was good and the staff are friendly and happy to help. The rooms are OK in size and very warm (exceptionally clean). The breakfast area is very small and the breakfast is very basic but its OK!! toast and coffee etc only! no full english at this hotel"
2,530,"Oct 27 2009 	Never stay here!	Am horrified to see that we have had the same experience as other travellers and wish I had read reviews before going to London. Arrived to find our apartment was not available - were informed that this had been communicated to our agent but they have no record of this - apparently at time of booking they were fully booked. It later transpired that it was due to problems in another room and our room had been given to another group who had booked in before us. We were offered 2 rooms which we had no choice but to take due to travelling with young children and the time we checked in. It definitely meant our break got off to a bad start. Apart from location I can think of nothing else which would make me want to stay here again or recommend to anyone (unless I didn't like them!) Old hotel, shabby, poor facilities and massively over priced."
3,530,"Oct 18 2009 	Not a great place to stay	Pros: Proximity to Oxford Street.Cons: Everything else...As someone else described, this hotel is a conversion and as a result some of the rooms must be great and some are rubbish. Mine was a strange layout, but of reasonable size - a bit tired to look at, but that seems to be the norm for hotels trying to save a penny or two in refurbishment costs. Unfortunately, long term (and ongoing) building works almost adjacent to the hotel make this one of the noisiest daytime rooms I ever been in (and I was doing some last minute revision for an exam!). At night I have to admit it was pleasantly quiet although not having double glazing is a puzzling choice in a city centre hotel.Contrary to other reviewers experience, my room was freezing (in the second week of October) with a barely functional radiator the only source of heat. Reception couldn't provide a standalone heater (&quot;people normally complain the rooms are too hot&quot;) so I resorted to using the lights, the trouser press and even the hair-dryer at one point to heat the room up!The en-suite bathroom was old, basic and cold with the poorest excuse for a shower I've ever witnessed. An interesting puzzle was the television (nice LCD) which provided the 5 analogue channels as well as a Freview selection, but unfortunately no-one's paid the engineers to come round and retune the sets after the recent channel changes so most of them are missing.The bed was at least comfortable and the continental breakfast was better presented than most other hotels I've stayed in recently.Overall, if you want a cheap hotel I advise you to stay in a Travelodge or Premier Inn somewhere else in central London and use the money saved to pay for the extra tube fare. Even at 30 this hotel would be charging too much."
4,530,"Aug 9 2009 	Terrible experience	A group of 5 of us booked a weekend break in London to celebrate our 30th Birthdays. We chose Astor Court Hotel as we wanted an apartment and the hotel was pretty central. The apartment was booked a couple of months in advance via the internet. We turned up at the hotel on friday night to be told that due to a problem with the fire alarm we couldn't stay in our apartment-(they had clearly given the accommodation to someone paying more). The only solution they offered was a hotel in a completely different part of London (and we had a table at a local restaurant booked for half an hour later!) - It also turned out that this alternative accommodation was a hotel room, rather than an apartment, and that it only slept 4 when there were 5 of us! We had to trawl round the area looking for an alternative, which meant that we missed our table reservation and had to spend extra money on transport. We found it disgraceful that they left 5 female travellers at night with no suitable options. The only compensation we got was our deposit back, but no apology and no offer of help with transport costs. Terrible!"
5,530,"Jul 21 2009 	Perfect location location location (without glamour or comfort).	Our party of 5 booked a 2 bedroom apartment, with a kitchen, bath, and sofa bed in the lounge. First the good: The room sizes are generous. The original coving and moulding is fantastic! We were in a top floor apartment, with windows in every room, as well as skylights in the hall, so it was bright and cheerful. The rooms were clean, and kept nicely clean. The location can't be beat, as it is a 5 minute walk to both Soho and Oxford Circus, 10 minutes on foot to Picadilly - and the tube is really the only way to travel in London. For the not so good: the sheets were starched and more than one of us woke up with skinned elbows. The matresses were old and very uncomfortable. The windows are single-paned and let in every noise from the busy district outside (lorries thundering by literally all night). The bath and shower had no shower head. The bathroom floor was a bit iffy, and definitely sloping toward scary. The continental breakfast, although conscienciously attended by friendly staff) was very basic. The desk staff (also very friendly) know nothing, so don't even bother to ask - they don't even know the type of parking zone in front of the hotel! Overall, it was a clean, budget-friendly hotel in a fabulous location. Anyone raised on television would be horrified by the old and battered state of the place. Realists without rheumatism can manage quite well. Pampering this is not, but there's all the rest of London to take care of that!"
6,530,"Jul 10 2009	Ideal for Central London	We booked an apartment for 4 people with 2 bed-rooms, kitchen and bathroom/shower for two nights. Arrived to find apartment not available for the first night due to refurbishment of a floor, so we had to settle for one without a kitchen and only a sofa bed in the second room. Only suitable for three people really. Continental breakfast buffet was adequate to set us up for the day sightseeing, etc. For the second night we were offered our original standard of apartment which was far superior - twin beds in second lounge room and kitchen with microwave, fridge, cutlery and crockery. The bathrooms, which were just ok, are in need of refurbishment. Good quality TV in the lounge bedroom.Ideally situated for Oxford Circus, Regent's Park, Great Portland Street Tube Station. Right next to BBC Broadcasting House. Overall, quite good value for 4 people in the centre of London."
7,530,"May 10 2009 	Enjoyed Our Stay Would Recommend And return	Hello folksI don't often leave reviews, but thought i would as others helped me in coming to a decision. Hopefully mine will do the same, although i do think that perhaps some of this all depends on which room you get. I took my girlfriend on a theatre break ( all inclusive deal ) and chose Astor court hotel due mainly to it's location and mostly good reviews.The hotel is around ten minutes walk from Oxford street and Regents street and so really is in a good location for shoppping and the tube.The room we had was fine , high ceilings, bathroom was big with bath, shower,sink and toilet. Bedroom was fine with a comfortable bed, and the icing on the cake was a separate living room with two seater sofa good sized television with built in free view . Some of the furniture is quite oldy worldy, that may bother some, but didn't us. Wireless internet was there, although we didn't use it so can't comment on really , and the usual tea / coffee maker / hair dryer facilities, oh and a trouser press. The room wasn't an apartment, just a normal double room that for some reason i was expecting to be small and cosey, perhaps from reading another review somewhere , but it was the opposite. All in all very nice and all clean. The included breakfast was continental style and held down stairs in two separate &quot;breakfast rooms&quot;. Selection was good, including, cereals, yogurt, tea, coffee, toast, Croissants , apple and orange juice. Cutlery was clean as were the tables, table cloths chairs etc and it was all &quot;help yourself&quot; so you could make as many return trips to the food as you wanted, you won't go hungry. Staff were all foreign and very friendly. We came back fairly late one night and asked for more tea / coffee for the room and were supplied with plenty. We also asked for directions and locations of shops for the next day and we were understood so there were no &quot;language barrier&quot; problems.All in all we were very happy, i would return again, i would ask for the same room again, and i'd recommend to a friend. Hope this helps.Simon.H."
8,530,Apr 26 2009 	Deffo Recommend this hotel for young travellers	Me and my friends make a trip to London once a year and the last time we went we stayed in this hotel. It is only 5 minutes walk from the centre of Oxford st so is really ideal for shopping. The rooms are a bit dated but are very clean. We stayed in one of the apartment rooms at the top there was 6 of us - it was a little cramped but would be ideal for 5 people. It think it worked out about 50 or 60 euro each for 2 nights which was pretty good value. I dont think there is a restaurant or any thing there so dont be thinking u can ring for room service :)
9,530,"Apr 4 2009 	Great location bit over priced perhaps	My friends took me to London for my birthday overnight &amp; we stayed here. Our room was lovely it was clean, beds were comfortable, freeview television, seating area...although it was abit cramped it was fine there was only three of us &amp; we generally don't get under each others feet. Bathroom was clean with a shower, bath &amp; sink, the toliet was in a seperate room, only issue with the bathroom for me was the door didn't shut properely &amp; so I found myself taking my suitcase in the bathroom to prop the door shut. Location was brilliant nearby Oxford street &amp; in a quite a posh area...we even saw Paul O'Grady walking down the street nearby lol. I can't comment on the breakfast since I didn't have any but my two friends said it was fine.All the staff were foreign &amp; so it was difficult to understand them sometimes &amp; they struggled to understand us sometimes too, but the majority of workers in London are foreign anyway so it did'nt bother me to be honest.All in all I enjoied my stay in the hotel but then again I wasn't picking up the bill when I checked prices online I have to say I was slightly disappointed &amp; feel that they do overcharge you but its London so it can be expected to be pricey anyway.If your looking for somewhere pleasant to stay I'd recommend it, if you don't mind the price :)"
10,530,"Mar 2 2009 	A lovely clean and centrally placed hotel	My husband and I and our 4 young children stayed here in Jan 2009. I had read positive reviews on trip advisor and I wanted to echo these. The hotel is minutes walk from Oxford Street. It is an old hotel but very clean. We had an apartment with 2 bedrooms, a seperate toilet and bathroom and a kitchen including fridge and microwave which meant we could make snacks after a days sightseeing. The continental breakfast was lovely too. The hotel staff were very helpful also. This hotel really helped to make our stay in London a very pleasant one."
11,530,"Feb 25 2009 	What a rip off!!!	I am really disappointed after paying 112.00 for the night of the state this hotel is in. The rooms were really dated and in urgent need of modernisation and breakfast was not served until 7.30. It was extremely hot in the evening as the radiators didnt switch off which meant I woke up with a terrible sore throat. The rooms didnt have double glazing which meant the very noisy street sounds kept me awake (including the banging from the building site just opposite) plus I could feel the underground vibrate through the hotel. My shower didn't work and there was no hot water, which meant I had to have a cold shower in the morning. The walls were so paper-thin that I was also kept awake by the person in the room next to mine who was snoring. The bathroom is extremely cold! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Please go to another hotel, Novotel Euston is only 10 minutes walk from this hotel and there is only a 10 difference in the price...WHAT A RIP OFF!!!"
12,530,"Feb 3 2009 	beware this hotel	i stayed at this hotel with my daughter and 1yr old grandson what a rip. icould not comfirm online booking so rang the hotel direct they said they could do me a better price direct .online it was 145.00 for 2 nights the hotel said they could do it for 122.00 i asked if this was all in they said yes . i did not get confirmation in writing or via email when we arrived they tried to charge me 245.00for the 2 nights they said i misunderstood 122.00was for 1 night, i was very upset they did reduce it in the end to 198.00 but still a lot so make sure you get a price on paper. i asked for a low room and got ground floor which was good but so noisey being right on the pavement, heating could not be turned off the room was like a furness you could not leave your window open being on ground floor.the room was very small. when leaving i asked the hotel to order me a taxi to go to the station another big mistake they call a private firm they charged me 15.00 when it was only 5.40 to get there ,so order your own taxi when needed.breakfast was busy but ok you were not rushed out. i would not stay here again as i think they were unfair. but good location and take heed to reviews and you might be alright"
13,530,"Jan 23 2009 	Decent hotel... excellent location... some problems though (Room 46)	We stayed there for 5 nights and while we never planned for a 5 star hotel, some things there just threw me off. First the positive: Location is excellent - 10 min to the tube, all the shopping and sightseeing buses minutes away. Good neighborhood. The hotel is relatively clean (not by Ritz standards but Holiday Inn clean). Rooms are small by US standards but very generous for Europe. Housekeeping is decent - still trying to figure out how they managed to vacuum around couple of books and newspapers that fell on the floor without moving them though. Breakfast is included but don't count on it being very nutritious - packed cheese and day old croissants... some jam, toasted bread and tea/coffee. Staff is extremely friendly. Internet station in the lobby (expensive). Wi-Fi available (even more expensive).Negative: Yes, it's an old, old and older building, but it would be a good idea to change/fix the windows - you can feel every wind gust in the room. Restroom is extremely small (which would be fine) but COLD! old single pane window and NO Heat. It does get cold in UK! I'm not sure why people wanted AC in the rooms in Winter, but trust me - you'd rather settle for heat in the restroom. Staff is very friendly but useless. They don't know what's around the hotel and are only able to call a cab (the most expensive one - don't ask them to call you a cab!) and direct you to the tube station where you can find (supposedly) whatever you're looking for. Not too much to eat around the hotel after 8pm - everything closes early except for McDonalds and couple restaurants. Appliances (bathtub, sink, etc) are probably as old as the building itself and the enamel on the bathtub is peeling off really bad. (we were in room 46 but I think it'll be similar with other rooms).Generally speaking, except for the cold restroom and leaking windows this was pretty much what we expected. Unless you're looking for luxury, this hotel will provide reasonably clean rooms and comfortable beds and generously large (by european standards) rooms."
14,530,"Jan 20 2009 	This hotel needs serious renovation!	This hotel reminded me a Soviet hotel from an old movie. OK, the room was generously sized, but there was no AC, no ventilation in the loo, old furniture, dilapidated lampshades, missing handles, etc. On top of this the shower did not work the first day. I complained - it was fixed, it barely worked for the next day and then broke again. We requested and got a different room. The service was not good overall. The hotel manager was trying to convince me that the shower worked and somehow, like most Americans I don't really know how to use it. The room was not made one day. The lack of AC forces you to sleep with the window open and it is really noisy outside (there is a construction site next to the hotel). The breakfast is typical English, nothing to be excited.The bottom line - stay out of this property, not recommended for anybody."
15,530,"Jan 19 2009 	Fine for a family break	We stayed here for two nights for a midweek half-term break to see a couple of shows, with children aged 11 and 16. We booked one of the &quot;apartments&quot; which was actually a small sitting room with 2 single beds in an alcove off, plus a double bedroom, bathroom and separate WC. OK not 5*, but decent 3*. Quiet room, comfortable beds, TV in sitting room and double bedroom. Fine for what we wanted - just a place to sleep and get breakfast. Bath enamel was somewhat stained and damaged, but it's an old building and the room certainly wasn't dirty - just old. Staff were polite and let us check in early, leaving our luggage in the (unsecured) luggage room at our own risk, but no problems. Continental breakfast in the basement breakfast room wasn't frilly, but it was fine and there was plenty of it. We were quite satisfied with the place, and would certainly use it again because it's incredibly convenient."
16,530,"Jan 19 2009 	Great location for shopping and shows	Stayed here 1 night for a shopping and theatre trip. Fantastic location for the price - just 5 mins brisk walk from Oxford Circus. Room was clean, bed comfortable, plenty of hot water, helpful staff, and a perfectly adequate continental breakfast. Exactly what we wanted for a short break."
17,530,Jan 5 2009 	Simple but a perfect base	My husband and I stayed 2 nights at this hotel. We wanted a good base to see London from.Check in was painless and the staff were both polite and friendly.The room wasn't 5 star but we never expected it to be - it was clean and warm....apart from the bathroom which was very draughty and my only real complaint.There is no bar in the hotel which is a shame but there's a nice little 'local' pub literally 2 doors down - which does nice daytime food and is reasonably priced. We had a great weekend. 2 nights in central london for 169 B+B!!! cannot complain - didn't try the breakfast unfortunatley bed was too comfy!!
18,530,"Dec 17 2008 	Great location	The Astor Court Hotel is placed right in the heart of London, just a few minutes walk from Oxford Street/Oxford Circus. The room was fine and the breakfast buffet was ok, but nothing special. The staff is friendly and helpful."
19,530,"Dec 14 2008 	Not so bad after all!	OK- before booking a hotel in London, we trawled all the review sites. Basically most hotels under 200 a night in a good location have mixed reviews- many comments mention hotels are older and suffer common problems such as old fashioned, small rooms, noise from Underground, no lift, miserable staff etc. so we were prepared for the worst. OK, the negatives first- hotel was older and a little tired especially the stair carpets (very Austin Powers). The luggage rooms were pokey and undecorated and the room had a suspicious odour of cigarette smoke (did not last too long once we got some windows open, The bathroom was pretty clean although a little &quot;mix and match&quot; and the shower mixer was temperamental.Now the middle ground- the staff varied between indifferent and excellent- the breakfast girl was a joy! There was a lift but quite small. There was noise from the Underground but we were too tired to notice when in the room. The room was well decorated and clean although the desk and office chair took up much space.Now the good stuff- walk in off the street and pay 175 a night for a double. We paid just over 70 by shopping around on the net. My favourite thing of note were the shoe shining machines on each floor- quirky!The room came with tea and coffee facs., hairdryer, trouser press, LCD TV, telephone, free digital safe and plenty of storage. The breakfast, although continental, was plentiful, the breakfast room was clean and bright and just a great start to the day. And finally the location- 5 mins walk to Regents Park or Regent Street, 10 min amble to Oxford Street, 2 mins to Great Portland St Underground, loads of pubs, delis and eateries nearby- busy with friendly media types from BBC Radio, Dave and the like. Recommend Villandry for gifts/ nibbles, Horse and Groom for a homely cheap pub, The Albany for trendy young things with the best pint of Peroni I have ever tasted and Sergios (as recommended to me by Steve Lemacq!) for some home cooked Italian fare that won't break the bank.Happy!"
20,530,"Dec 9 2008 	Cheap but Basic	If you are wanting a cheap place to crash in central London after getting drunk this is it. If you are after high quality / standards in a Hotel look elsewhere.Positive: The hotel location in central London is excellentFriendly staffNegative:The hotel room &amp; general decor are in bad need of refurbishment. Real 1970's Fawlty Towers looking. Room was very very noisy,all night traffic &amp; general noise - no double glazing. The bathroom was pretty grime &amp; the shower was luke warm.Breakfast was a very crowded affair with people packed into one room. Very small glasses for the orange juice &amp; cheap food."
21,530,"Oct 29 2008 	Astor Court was lovely!!	Having booked the Hotel online I then read some of the reviews just before we left to go to London on holiday, so felt a wee bit unsure about what to expect after seeing the mixed reviews. We're now back home after a great holiday in London and our stay at the Astor Court was lovely!Having travelled from Scotland down to Kings Cross on the train, it was a short taxi ride (15 mins and under 10.00) to the Hotel. We had originally booked a family room so it was a pleasant surprise to be given an apartment. This was comfortable and spacious! The bathroom was fine and it was handy to have the small kitchen. Our 2 wee boys loved going down for breakfast each morning - there was a great choice of food and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. The location was very central - a short walk down to Oxford Circus and the tube. There were a number of 'family-friendly' italian /pizza restaurants close by. We were right next to the BBC radio studios - great for 'star-spotting' Radio 2 dj's !! We weren't disturbed at all with noise from the construction work across the road and the street was very quiet at night. You could hear the rumble of the tube trains but this didn't bother us.Our only 'gripes' would be that the twin beds were in the living room - realistically where children would sleep....the large tv was also in this room, so not a good idea to put it on when you're settling a 3-year old! During our stay a small (digital) tv was put into our bedroom which was handy. There was a large wardrobe although not enough hangers and some drawers would have been handy....I also found the bedroom to be so hot and it was hard to turn the radiators down / off. The domestic staff on our floor were lovely - we met Betty - she was friendly without being intrusive.We would definitely recommend the Hotel to family and friends, this was our first family trip to London and we hope to return one day!"
22,530,"Sep 28 2008 	Good Location HUGE Rooms	This review is a little late...Me and a friend were going to London for a bit of retail therapy, sightseeing and clubbing.We picked this hotel becasue of the price and location.When we arrived at the hotel we were told that check-in isn't until 2pm, but we were able to leave our bags in a room so we wouldn't have to carry them around.The location of this hotel couldn't have been any better, around a 3 minute walk from Oxford Street (Topshop, Nike Town etc.)The rooms were better than we had expected. With a bathroom, separate toilet, two twin beds, wardrobe and sitting area.There were tea &amp; coffee making facilites, TV etc.Breakfast is included, but it's only continental. We were late getting up so we missed breakfast, but we looked in the breakfast rooms and there are things like bread, cereal, croussants etc.I would go back to this hotel again due to the location and size of the rooms, the only downside was that we had to check out of our rooms at 11am, so had to walk around London with our bags, which was bit of a pain!!"
23,530,"Sep 15 2008 	Budget with a capital B...	Stayed in the Astor Court recently and I fail to see how this property is rated 3 star. Furthermore, I certainly could not see any evidence of redecoration anywhere, contrary to what is stated on the hotel website. All in all it is just adequate. More a 'hotel' for those only wanting a bed for a night without any of the trimmings of a modern 3 star or 4 star hotel. The location is fine in that we could walk to the main attractions in 10-15 mins. We did not have the luxury of hot water any morning of our stay and the bathroom and toilet appear not to have been changed since the war. All in all a bit of a disappointment."
24,530,"Aug 22 2008 	Pleasantly surprised!	Just got back from London, after staying in the Astor Court Hotel for one night. After reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, I was a bit dubious. Arrived late due to coach problems, but when we got there we were told they had overbooked and were being upgraded from a twin room to an apartment, so we were off to a good start! The girl on reception was very friendly and helpful.The room was nice and spacious, although the decorating was a little old fashioned, however this was a minor detail. We also found the kitchen a bit grotty, but this didn't matter as my boyfriend and I didn't need to use it. The only thing that could have been a problem was that the hairdryer in the room did not work, but i had bought my own with me. Although our room was lovely, i can imagine that anything other than the apartment would be fairly small and possibly a bit cramped.The breakfast was simple, but it did the job! Plenty to choose from with juices and a machine for hot drinks.Overall, we were quite impressed with the hotel and wouldnt definitely go there again. The location is great, with easy access to everything."
25,530,"Aug 2 2008 	Worst hotel ever	While Astor Court Hotel had a good location for our needs and the breakfast was OK, that is all I can say positive about it. I know that European hotel standards are not the same as US standards, but this hotel set a low for quality during our three week trip through five countries. The rooms are old and several items did not work. The towel rack literally fell off the wall drenching our towels in the tub. The room layouts are atrocious and do not allow for any air circulation. It was hot while we were in London and the hotel has no air conditioning. This would not be a problem but for the room layout and the fact they have no ceiling fans in the rooms or fans they can give to you to put in the window. When asked about this the staff could have cared less. Except for the girl who worked nights the staff was totally useless. In an effort to get the room cool we had to leave the window wide open. The street noise is horrible and the ongoing construction next door wakes you early and goes all day long. The TV's are miniscule and the cable (if you can call it that) quality was horrible. We supposedly had a three person room which appears to be a two person room with a cot cramed into it leaving absolutely no room for luggage let alone to walk around or sit. The only positive attribute the Astor Court Hotel has to offer is location. I would pick any other place to stay over the Astor Court Hotel."
26,530,"Jul 29 2008 	Large rooms for families	Great place to stay in central London. Close to Oxford street.Got a large apartment with plenty of room for our family of four. Room was clean but as in many London hotel the interior was a bit old. Small kitchen that suited our needs. Good service at check-in. Was first placed in a family room as booked, but the day after reception called and offered us an apartment. Decent breakfast buffet included.Only negative thing to mentioned is the noice from the street as windows are not well isolated.On the basis of the noice and the pricing I rate it three. Otherwise I would have given it a four"
27,530,"Jun 30 2008 	Very bad service	I booked this hotel based on the fairly good reviews and because they had an apartment room that could sleep 5/6 people. A group of my girlfriends and I were going to London for the weekend and loved the idea of a suite that we could all stay in together and have a good old laugh.I booked this hotel and even rang the day before to check that they had the booking for 5 in the apartment room, which they did. When we arrived we were informed that the apartment room was not available and that we were in two twin rooms one of which would have an extra bed put in it!I was not very happy about this and when asked why this was the case was given some sob story about the people who were in the room being unable to leave but we could still have the 2 rooms for the same price of apartment.... how kind!We did not receive an apology and the staff sniggered behind our backs and were inpolite, they thought it was all highly amusing that they had put a serious dampner on our weekend.If I had know the apartment was not available I would have booked elsewhere!We asked to speak to the manager and told that &quot;he did not liked to be called&quot;.... what kind of manager is that! I then asked why the other people had not been asked to leave and the supervisior claimed they had left the hotel early, any other decent hotel would have told the other people that yes of course they could stay an extra night but not in the only apartment room as this had been booked by another group, but no, this is way to difficult for them.After being totally fobbed off we informed the hotel staff that as we had no choice other than to stay in the 2 other rooms they should give us a discount as compensation, to which they replied we were getting the 2 rooms cheaper as they would only take payment for the apartment room. I explained to them this was not the point and was hardley compensation aas we would never pay more. They then told us that they could not give a discount as they were not authorised too and needed payment upfront, remember the manager does not like to be called!Eventually they did agree to give us a discount, so they lied to us again as they could authorise it without the manager!To make things worse the rooms were very small and basic whereas I know the apartment room is of a good size, plus one of the girls had to sleep on a bed that was shoved in any old how.I would not recommend this hotel as they were very rude!"
