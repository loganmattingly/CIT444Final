126,2182,"Dec 8 2004	Probably the most value for money hotel I've stayed at	Well I stayed here about 3 years ago and was nothing but impressed with the place. The location is unbeatable, and the price was fab. I think I paid just over $100 for what was a very clean and cozy room, which for SF is a bargain. As for the rest of the hotel, I agree with what some of the other reviewers have said - it's classy, very San Fransisco and the staff were very friendly and helpfull. Special note to Bob the Concierge, who I still remember from my visit. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
127,2182,"Oct 25 2004	A charming place to stay.	The hotel is charming - another reviewer said shabby chic and that is a fitting description. It is after all, an older building that has been kept up. If you want new, modern, and homogenized, then stay at a name brand hotel and be prepared to spend substantially more. But if you want a cozy hotel with thoughtful service (Bob, the concierge is the best) this is a wonderful place within walking distance of everything."
128,2182,"Aug 30 2004	more than OK.	We stayed for 6 days and the hotel is just fine. I found the rooms to be clean and for the age of the hotel just fine. If you're an Elk's member you get a special rate which is half the price of the area hotels. Plus the Elks lodge is wonderful with a great Bar and better than average restuarant. The hotel is located within walking distance of Union Square 300 feet, China town 1/4 mile. And the start one of the cable cars, and Bart, 3 blocks. Taxi's cost about $9 to get to fishermans warf, Peir 39 and the ferries. All in all a great expierence and the concierge Bob is a great help as were all the employee's. Be prepared to wait for your room though as it took about 1 hr(4:30pM) But don't worry there's a place to stow your luggage and plenty to due right around the hotel."
129,2182,"Aug 18 2004	I can't imagine WHO would call this place ""FILTHY""	Reviews like the previous one trashing this hotel for being supposedly &quot;filthy&quot; make this website very suspect. We just returned from a 3 night stay. It's a charming little jewel box of a place. The Royal Court floor rooms (11th floor- an upgrade) are adorable, very clean, and as roomy as the rest of the European style hotels on Union Square. We liked it better than the Diva and about as well as our previous fave, the Warwick Regis. The location is phenomenal and the bed is so comfortable you may never venture out of it! You have to really wonder why someone would just trash a lovely little hotel and call it &quot;filthy&quot; and &quot;dark.&quot; I'm suspecting a disgruntled former employee???? We paid $135 a night for buy 2 nights, get the 3rd free. I mean it doesn't get too much better than this."

1,2199,Oct 8 2007 	What do you want?	If you want a fancy hotel room to while away your time in - this is not the place.If you want a decent and clean hotel room in the best possible location in San Francisco - you'll love this place.Yes - the building exudes all of the charm that only a 100 year old building can - but the club is spotless and the staff can not be more accomodating. The rooms are sized appropriately to customs of 100 years ago - but they have recently been redecorated and are perfectly acceptable.The Club is located at the intersection of the Powell Street and the California Street cable car lines. Nearly all of (touristy) SF is downhill from here and just a short walk from a cable car line. Couple that with a room rate of at least 50% less than any nearby hotel and you cannot go wrong.Yes - there is no air conditioning - but we were there during a particularly warm spell and the room was fine. Yes - the rooms are on the lower floors of the building and there is some street noise - but mostly it's the bells on the cable cars and they don't start until after 6AM anyway. All in all - for the price - you cannot go wrong. If you really dislike the accomodations - moving to the Fairmont is a walk across the street... For a central location to explore all of SF at a great rate though - look no further!
2,2199,"May 26 2006	Two Thumbs Down for the University Club of San Francisco	My wife and I are members of the Yale Club in New York City, a wonderful facility. On a recent business trip to San Franciso we decided to try another university club lodging experience and booked a room at the University Club of San Francisco on Nob Hill. We quickly learned that not all university clubs are created equal.On paper and on the web the University Club on San Francisco seemed to have a lot going for it - location, price, in-club dining, and a limited number of lodging rooms. On site though it was a very different story. We arrived in the late evening and the first room we were given was down a mildewy-smelling hallway on the first floor and was dark and warm. We quickly discovered there was no air conditioning and that the window, which faced an alley, would only open a few inches. Those few inches were not enough to generate a breeze, even with the help of a ceiling fan, but more than enough to allow the ceaseless noise of traffic and cable cars laboring up California Street to make the room unpleasantly loud. The lighting in the room was unpleasant - only one of the bed side lamps worked and the bulb in it must have been 300w. Other than that it was just the ceiling light, which cast an unpleasant glare thoughout the room. We quickly returned to the front desk and were told we could move to another room on the second floor. Up the quaint elevator we went and moved into our second room. Though larger and better lit it still had the funky mildew smell and the windows opened directly onto Powell Street, and the cacophony of traffic and the Powell Street cable cars. At this point we were so tired that my plan was to shower and hope to sleep through part of the night. The first towel I grabbed in the garish red bathroom had a saucer-sized hole in the middle of it! The second was frayed, but largely intact. That was it for me. The following morning we checked out and moved to the Clift Hotel and enjoyed a wonderful remainder of our stay in San Francisco.To be fair, as we were checking out another guest was singing the praises of the University Club of San Francisco's rooms. I am glad he had a good stay. My wife and I certainly did not."
3,2199,"Jan 25 2006	Excellent Value at a Venerable Private Club	I used my reciprocal club arrangement to stay at the University Club prior to our trip to Napa valley. Located on Nob Hill across the street from the Fairmont Hotel, the club is nicely furnished with a beautiful library and outside balcony overlooking the bay. Although there are only about 20 rooms, it was a thrill to stay in this quiet, tastefully decorated gem - don't miss it!"
1,2201,"Aug 21 2009 	you get what you pay for	The room was about the size of the bed, bedsheets and blanckets were filthy. Hallways were dirtry and poorly kept. The neighbourhood also is not the best in SF... you really get what you pay for."
2,2201,"Jul 16 2009 	Didn't allow to occupy the Room although i had booked everything online	I had a terrible experience here and that's why i am writing even after a year of my staty in this lousy hotel. The hotel front desk guys are very unfriendly and have a hatred for a people from a specific country. Though i had booked online, i didnt carry the print out and hence i was asked to wait for more than 1 and 1/2 hour. They dont have a proper fax machine also and when i contacted priceline to send the fax again, they couldn't receive the fax message. This happened just in front of my eyes.There is no customer service at all. Ridiculous, dont stay here."
3,2201,"Mar 20 2009 	Awfullterrible bed bugs never again!!!!	It can be found in not very mice neightborhood- lot of homeless people sleeping on the streets. If I close my both eyes for room itself I would say &quot;on budget, do not expect anything&quot; kind of ratind. But the bathroom (too nice name for that place) STINKS!! Bathtub from II World war, stepping in only in shoes. Then falling asleep - not chance- BED BUGS will wake you up for sure!!! The biggest problem I brought them with me to my friends place in Fresno whom I visited for wedding anniversary and eventually brought them home to Europe. I keep fighting against them still and can not get rid of. Is not there any HEALTH AUTHORITY in US that would close such a place? DO NOT GO THERE! You safe yourself a lot of trouble. I have even changed the room, but bugs were also there. So such a small thing that donut and lousy coffee is the breakfast did not matter anymore. I was just waiting to open in the morning and flee AWAY!! I would rather pay some extra for higher level ."
4,2201,"Aug 30 2008 	Very good value and short walk to everything	The other reviews here does in general not do this hotel justice. What do you expect when you can get a single room for $ 42 on Priceline? I enjoyed my stay here, and would easily recommend it to people who are traveling with an open mind and who have spent a night in a hostel or a low-key hotel before. I had a room with a shared bath room in the hallway (but it seemed like I was the only one using it, so there was no line or dirt in the there.) The room was decent enough, with an old television set that seemed to be from the 1970's that did not have more than a few channels with bad reception, but it was a pretty cool piece of history, and who's in San Francisco to watch TV anyway? The windows were slightly dirty and facing the street, but I didn't experience much noise. It's in the Tenderloin, which means that you can walk to the BART train or the cable car in a few minutes, and to Union Square too. There's been said a lot about the Tenderloin on Trip Advisor before, and I'm not gonna pretend that it's a particularly beautiful place, and there's a lot of homeless people on the streets, but they never even asked for change as I walked through the neighborhood many times, and they never seemed to bother anyone. In my opinion, it's an area that you can easily stay in and walk through anytime if you're a guy or in a group, although I can understand it if single females or families with kids do not wish to spend a lot of time here. I don't think much is going to happen to anyone, except perhaps being if you can spare a dime. I was also gonna say that the hotel may not be the best spot for a romantic holiday, but now I just remembered that the couple in the room next door were gettin' it on both when I checked in at night and also the next morning when I woke up (the walls are VERY thin), so I might have to reconsider that thought. If you're open minded, want to save a lot of money, and don't mind seeing the slightly shadier sides of California, this is a pretty good deal."
5,2201,"Jul 18 2008 	S**t Hole	I would say my stay at this hotel was worse than terrible. I have never stayed anywhere like this hotel before. We walked in and we got the key and went up to the room and right away I called Priceline to see if they could find us another hotel. Priceline would not help us, Priceline did tell me if we got another hotel we could not get any of our money back. So dont ever book anything through Priceline either. I got it 2 ways while there. Nor did Priceline tell me we would have to pay 25 dollars a day for parking on top of what we paied for that nasty room. Nor do they tell you parking is 2 and a half blocks from the hotel. When there my daughter and I was walking back from parking our car and people was selling and not trying to hide what they were doing. And I did take pictures of the room if you dont beleave what I am telling you."
6,2201,May 24 2008 	terrible place!!!!	It is one of the worst hotel I have ever seen ! it is very dirty and it is in a very dangerous area... do not ever go there!
7,2201,"Feb 2 2008 	Oh my gosh!!!!	We book a hotel 2 days before we went to San Francisco on the last minute, and we were surprised on the location. The room are small, I dropped something and rolled under the bed and I found something else, I think that room was never been dusted. we could not sleep that night, because people outside we're talking very loud. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
8,2201,"Oct 21 2007 	Fantastic Place	Had a fantasic stay here. It's not the Ritz, but it's very centrally located within easy reach of everything. The homeless people are around, but we had no problems. In fact, when slimming down my contents of my suitcase a pair of my pants flew out the hotel window, and ended up on the flag pole! So the hotel Verona had an American flag, a British flag and a pair of my pants on show! The pants then slipped to the floor and a homeless person picked them up and carted them off!It was very entertaining watching the drama unfold in the evening on the street! I would honestly recommend this place to anyone, just open your mind, and see something new, and if nothing else, you will return home grateful for what you have in life."
9,2201,"Oct 16 2007 	If you like diseases the ghetto and being mugged...you'll love this place.	The room was very tiny, and very out of date. The TV only got about 4 channels and the windows were covering in bird poop. The view from the window was creepy...an alley with a fire ecsape and some wigs and clothes hanging off some wiring. Not to mention it was located in the scariest part of the city. It was so nasty, I didn't even want to shower in the bathroom or sleep in the bed. I slept on top of the blankets and didnt sit on the toliet seat in fear contracting something. AND they make you sign a contract when you check in saying that if anything is stolen, they can't be held responsible. I don't ever remember signing anything like that in the past when I've stayed at a hotel. Something positive? I attended a kick [--] Gwar concert. Something positive about the HOTEL?....I couldn't tell you. I wouldn't suggest anyone to stay there..."
10,2201,"Aug 24 2007 	Loved the transportation	I stayed alone at Verona for 5 days during my conference visit in Hyatt Regency, Embarcadero St. The hotel has a fantastic transportation convenience, that there is a Bart station in front of the hotel. The area there however was not very noisy. I was a bit nervous and scared at my first day there because of the amount of homeless people over there. However, during my remaining 4 days stay, i was used to it. The big tip is not to care about any of the homeless people. They would ask u for money, u can just ignore them and nothing bad would happen. By seeing this fact, I think it is quite a peaceful street to live in. In terms of service and facility of the hotel, they have a tv set and an attached bathroom in my hotel room. Nothing is particularly unpleasant. They also provide free breakfast every 7am to 9am. However, the breakfast is limited to 1 donut per person and with free flow of coffee.So, I would recommend this hotel for you, if you want a nice and cheap (around $58 per night) hotel to stay at."
11,2201,"Aug 3 2007 	Verona - San Fran - YUK!!!	Booked through an agency at last minute, what a mistake. If only I had read some reviews from 'TripAdvisor' first! I was travelling from London on way to NZ.. The driver of the San Fran taxi asked me 'how did you choose this place?' And when I asked him why, he just said... don't go walking around at night!I was a tad concerned. But on arriving at 1.30am I was even more concerned at the area I was in. Thought that I would be OK as it was only 3 blocks from Union Square. How wrong I was then, too.The entrance was dark, dull and dirty.The lift was old and rickety.The corridor and room smelt of dried urine.The room itself was dirty, though sheets were clean.Stains on the floor in bathroom.Towels and shower clean, though shower curtain left a lot to be desired.Small spiders came out of the overflow hole in hand-basin.TV didn't work very well. -I was told that building is being upgradedBreakfast !! well, sweet doughnuts were in a cardboard box on the hotel lobby desk, and some hot coffee &amp; water was also availalbe down there. Outside there were many people wandering around drinking, with some sleeping on the street while others were selling items until 5am - 6am each morning. Outside the Hotel, there were people having mini-fights and yelling to each other all night - this was along all the streets nearby so it was very noisy even with bedroom window shut. In the day-time groups of men were blocking footpaths, needing me to either walk through them or go onto the road amongst traffic. Most of these people were drinking or had difficulty walking.A feeling of being unsafe was strong, but I did stay as I had pre-paid. Such a shame as it has now added to my dissatisfaction about being in the USA..... I will not come again.I will not use that internet accommodation agency again - and will send them a report, too."
12,2201,"May 18 2007 	Worst Hotel Ever!	My job requires me to travel all over the country, and have stayed at many hotels (some good and some bad). I decided to go to a travel website and saw Verona for only 35$ a night but when i got there i found out why it was so cheap. There are drug addicts all around and very sketchy people. I saw one smoking a crack pipe right in front of the hotel, and i saw another getting frisked by an undercover cop. When i parked right in front by a meter, a homeless man knocked on my window and asked me if i needed any &quot;aids&quot; refering to drugs. Another lady was right in front swigging down a cheap bottle of vodka at noon. I checked in to the hotel around that time, and when i did the desk clerk wanted to charge me 35$ (the same price of the hotel) to park my car. I talked her down to 10$. I then went up the creaky elevator from 1920 saw my room with a stained comforter and tv that didnt work, and basically checked out right then. I checked in at noon and checked out a half hour later. I can honestly say you will not feel safe at this hotel and even though its cheap I wouldnt risk my safety for a few bucks. Worst Hotel Ever!"
13,2201,"Apr 12 2007 	Horrible in all senses	Definitely not recommended. Yes, the staff was nice, hopefully!The place is horrible, dirty (I was wondering if we were going to find bugs in the bed linen) and located in the worst street of Tenderloin. We didn't even have a shower in the morning because of the state of the barhroom. I don't know about the rest of the floors, but the 5th one was very noisy and with constant door slammings during all the night.Summary: avoid Verona, there are other places better located and around the same budget."
14,2201,"Jun 26 2006	in the heart of the tenderloin.	i was a little nervous based on the prior reviews, but alas, there were no bedbugs, or bugs of anyother sort. i checked under the bed, under the blanket, under the sheets, in the closet. the hotel itself isn't half bad. the rooms are small, it's noisy and the hotel staff aren't overly friendly, but i have a feeling that has something to do with the location (which i'll get into later).the rooms have a full size tub in a tiny bathroom. the sink is located directly across from the beds (not in the bathroom). the elevator is super old school, it smells like an old attic, but that's vintage, baby!*dun dun duuuuuuuuun*:the view:if you don't know what the tenderloin district is, then go here:http://www.answers.com/topic/tenderloin-san-francisco-california.if you think your brave enough and have a sense of humor, then this is the place for you. it's a little scary at first, but when alls said and done, it's not that bad. in fact, it can be a little entertaining, it's fun to look out of your window and see all the activities on the street. there are tons of bums around, drinking beer, illin, yelling, singing, doing deals. we saw 2 men and a woman smoking crack from our window. out in the open. apparently the cops are afraid to work in the 'loin. they hang out in corners and across the street from the verona. i don't think they bother people much. i didn't even see them asking people for money. the hotel staff said not to leave anything in the car, because they'll take it. we saw a couple bums with mini-garage-sales, selling miscellaneous articles of clothing, and other random stuff. don't know where they got it. all in all it's sad, but hey this is the reality of life."
15,2201,"May 30 2006	A nice hotel. I will stay again	I stay at the verona hote on april 2006. they have renovated put new carpets, beds and have painted the rooms. I think that this hotel is in a good condition no matter what other people say. I can say that front desk clerk is friendly and can help you with everything you need. the neighborgood is not that bad. I can say that it is a good hotel. I will saty again no matter what other people say.just because other people say is bad I thought that is better to see it for my self than believing other people."
16,2201,"Jan 11 2006	disguisting and full of bugs and rats	when i first arrived to the hotel i was greeted by a friendly staff. when i requested my room reservation he said he had to reservation for me but he said he will give me a deal and only charge me $80 a night. i luckly had my confirmation code and i got the price for $40. on my way to the room, i saw a large rat running along side the hallway. when i got to my room my toilet was licking and my sing was clogged. i was too tired to complain so i decided to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow. when i was in bed. i felt something bitting me and threw off the covers to see atleast a dozen bugs on me. i killed then all. when i bend down to clean them i looked under the bed and say hundreds of bugs and cocroaches. i disgusted and complained and got a new room. the next day i checked out and went to the madarin hotel which in really nice."
17,2201,"Nov 26 2005 	Bed Bug Problem	I needed to stay in SF for one night, so I booked the cheapest hotel I could find on the internet, which cost less than $40 including tax. Due to some flight problem, I arrived around midnight. On the way to the hotel, I walked for less than 10 min from Powell St BART station, passing quite a few homeless people. But I expected this based on the tripadvisor reviews. And those people really didn't bother me. I checked in a room on 5th floor, a small room with a leaking toilet. I had to shut the bathroom door so that I wouldn't hear the sound of water. After lying on bed for an hour, I couldn't sleep and felt itchy on my face, neck and arms. After turning on the light, I found out dozens of big and small bugs crawling on the pillows. After killing some of them, I could see my blood from their dead bodies. I talked to a friendly staff in front desk and changed a room on 4th floor. This time, I was lucky to sleep through the night without any bugs in sight. The bed sheet and carpet were OK. The next morning, I found this room had a clogged sink. I have to say I got what I paid for and I learned my lesson. I stayed in Chancellor Hotel near Union Square two years ago with a pleasant experience. I wish I stayed in Chancellor this time."
18,2201,"Nov 14 2005	Great hotel if you are on a budget	This is a great hotel if you are on a budget. I got a terrific deal on a travel web site. 4 nights for $134 on my charge card bill, including all taxes and charges (I didn't use the phone anyway). Don't think you can find a better deal ($33.50 a night) anywhere in sf. True, it is not in a good area (tenderloin district), but I think if you practice awareness and watch your surroundings at all times you are relatively safe staying there. I wouldn't stay at this hotel with my girlfriend or wife and family if I had one, you should spend a little more to stay at a better hotel in a nicer neighborhood, but as a single guy on a budget this is a good bare bones place to stay. There is a police station right around the corner so there were police walking the area at night after midnight. I didn't expect much, didn't care about pastries for breakfast (but what do you expect when you pay $33 a day?) and went out to the corner diner for breakfast. There is a chinese restaurant on the corner next door and other places to eat in the area. close to the #19 bus that takes you to ghiradelli square and is about 3 blocks from the bart station. It is about 6 blocks from union square so not very far from the action. while I was there, there were groups of females and males staying in the hotel for halloween and they were coming and going at all hours of the night so I felt comfortable there. Even when they left after halloween, the hotel was a little empty but I didn't feel threatened at all in the hotel. Hotel management locks the door after 11 at night so you have to show your room key if they don't recognize you. You can call the hotel to warn them of you coming at night so they will let you in quickly if you are afraid of being mugged. yes, there were bunches of &quot;suspect&quot; people hanging around the neighborhood at all hours of the day and night, but I didn't see any drug dealing and wasn't bothered by any of these people and I ignored any of them that tried to get money from me. Most of the time I would cross the street or walk on the street to avoid any encounters and wasn't bothered by any of them. BTW, this hotel and the aida hotel on market street are owned and run by the same people. So if you just need a decent place to stay at a great price, the verona is all right. But if you want to stay at a nicer place in a safer neighborhood, you will be paying more than double the price. Just my 2 cents, hope it helps others who are looking for a cheap place to stay. Just remember that you get what you pay for and you won't be disappointed."
19,2201,"Nov 1 2005	Not worth it	a) situated in a really dodgy area full of drug addicts, it's really not appealing to tourists because it doesnt convey a safe environment image. b) the staff are really not helpful and ... a bit dodgy themselvesc) the rooms arent great (TV not working, smelly through-out the hotel)d) the supposedly &quot;included breakfast&quot; consisted in a hot water container in the lobby with 5 random tea bags, no cups and a small box of doughnuts or pastry bought by someone from the hotel presumably, with flies flying around the box..so not what you'd call breakfast really.  So all in all I wouldnt recommend it at all, as there are plenty of other nice places to choose from in San Francisco. Positive point though: relatively close (i.e. scary walking distance) from BART public transport and Union square (roughly 15 minutes)."
20,2201,"Aug 9 2005	Cheap in all senses.	We stayed 3 nights in Verona and did not really enjoy it. In fact, the only good thing about it, is the price: $ 102/night for 5 persons (2 rooms), breakfast incl. The rooms weren't very clean (the sheets were, luckily). Bathroom on the corridor: there was some pigeon (feces) on the lavabo, which hasn't been wiped away for 3 days. Do they ever clean the place? Breakfast consists out of some sweet donuts and muffins - &quot;served&quot; in a cardboard box with a few napkins - with bad coffee out of paper cups.But the worst thing is the street were it is located: Leavenworth, on the border of the dismal &quot;Tenderloin&quot; neighbourhood. We saw junks, dealers and homeless people whenever we left the hotel and were always a bit frightened to get back at night. Nothing ever happened, though. I have to admit, once you are a few blocks further, you are right in the heart of downtown San Francisco, near Union Square. So, if you don't mind dirt and an unfriendly looking neighbourhood and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this is the place to be. Otherwise: keep away!"
21,2201,May 21 2009 	Il peggior hotel della mia vita!!!
1,2202,"Great time	We stayed at the Villa Florence over Thanksgiving weekend and the lighting of the Christmas tree on Union Square. We booked two rooms. Tony at the front desk was very accomodating making sure our request for king sized beds and quiet rooms towards the back of the hotel were fulfilled. The location of the hotel was perfect for shopping and grabbing a cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. Yes the rooms are smaller, but we did not spend much time there with so much to see and do. They were offering a $105.00 online special which we booked several months ago. We would definitely stay here again. The location is perfect for resturants and the service we encountered was very good. The only bad thing was that they wanted to charge extra in Valet for an suv insted of the posted charge. Thankfully the hotel manager took off the additional charge. I have never heard of being charged extra because your vehicle is bigger than a toyota."
2,2202,"Nov 20 2009 	consistently good experience nice hotel great location	I have stayed here twice for work and both times were great. The rooms are nice and clean. There is a fitness center, restaurant, and coffee shop on site. You are walking distance to Union Square and many restaurants/shopping locales."
3,2202,"Nov 14 2009 	Average hotel not disappointed but not impressed either	We stayed in a comfortable, clean room with street view  note that we were warned by the receptionist that it might be noisy, still we opted for the street view. After midnight it got quiet. :-) The bathroom was a bit of a disappointment: small and old, with a tiny sink and no room for toiletries. The restaurants downstairs are very good. We had a delicious breakfast at Kuletos."
4,2202,"Nov 8 2009 	perfrect Place	Stayed here for one night to celebrate a birthday. The staff were VERY welcoming and helpful. It was in the perfect area to stay for shopping and seeing the great musical 'Wicked'. The room was great, bed very comfortable ...and my pooch was welcome. Would stay here again."
5,2202,Nov 6 2009 	Exceeded Expectations	Loved staying in this hotel and visiting three premium restaurants all within two block. We stayed two nights and the location was perfect for everywhere we wanted to visit. Service was excellent. Only complaint was that the mattress was harder than expected and not pillow-top as described. Still slept well. We opened the mini-bar right before we left and it was stocked with clear prices. Probably would use it next time. Very clean and toiletries were great. Didn't eat in the restaurant downstairs but the food looked great every time we passed by (and it was packed). We had an inside room as it was recommended and we are glad we did. The front streets are busy but we didn't hear a thing. They even set out wine for our honeymoon. Charges and requests were all accurate. Would definitely stay again.
6,2202,"Nov 3 2009 	Worst Customer service	I stayed at the Villa Florence for four nights while in San Francisco for business during October. The lobby was nice and so were the front desk people and hotel Manager had a bad attitude from the other guest and me. I arrived in my &quot;travel clothes&quot;; jeans and a hoody and felt terribly under dressed. Front desk asked me  are you here for pleasure or business, I told her business and she said business what kind of business. Hotel Manager looked and laughed to me and I got insulted. Front desk person said, There is NO parking. You have to use the our valet service, which is $40/night plus parking tax and extra tips for valet person. My room was on the second floor and next to OFarrell street too close to street level for someone girl like me who is not entirely accustomed to city noise which lasts all night. The room was uncomfortable, noisy and small. The TV and phone did not work. I opened my minibar fridge and was overwhelmed by a horrible smell and odor. There was some sort of black moldy food left in there. When I called the front desk they said no more room left and I wanted to talk to General Manager but not available or hotel Manager was not available too so I left voice message in his mail box. Third night only the moved me to a new room and thoroughly apologized but did not discounted for because I was part of group. I believe hotel manager did not care of any problem of guests had. Television was not working, phone was not working and it was SO loud! and Thursday mornings are trash pick up...and Friday and Saturday nights are musical day for street people."
7,2202,"Oct 29 2009 	Friendly accommodating good location	Good location for access to many areas of the city. The entire staff was friendly and eager to please. They were very helpful for a first-time visit to a wonderful city. Their suggestions in getting around the city and in arranging for transportation was second to none. We stayed in a junior suite and had plenty of room for two couples. Request a room away from the street if nighttime noises tend to keep you awake. The restaurant atmosphere at Kuleto's was lovely, and the food was very good. We would return to this hotel on another visit!"
8,2202,"Oct 27 2009 	Great hotel	We stayed at the Villa Florence the weekend of Oct. 16th. I got an unbelievable rate on local getaways and we were not disppointed. We were on the 6th floor and had a room away from the streetside. We never heard a noise the 4 nights we were there. It was super quiet. The room was quite large, by San Fran standards. The bed was super comfortable. The front desk was very friendly and the free internet access in the lobby came in handy on more than 1 occassion. The location on Powell street cannot be beat and this hotel is convenient to everything. If I can get a decent rate, I'm not sure I'll ever stay anywhere else."
9,2202,"Oct 27 2009 	A special location for a wonderful mini vacation!	I was surprised to find a small hotel in a very central location in SF at such a reasonable rate in a world class city! The service was great and dinner at Kuleto's next door was superb. If you don't want the sounds of the city (sirens, street musicians playing saxophones and garbage trucks in the morning) don't stay here. But if you want a wonderful SF vacation spot near the cable cars, Union Square, Foley's Irish Pub, and Kuletos for dinners, give this place a try. The service was superb, the rooms are renovated to include a killer shower, and all the electronic amenities you need are provided in the room including an IPOD docking station and wireless internet. We would definitely return."
10,2202,"Oct 27 2009 	Worth the money very clean!	Beautiful hotel, the room was small but very charming and spotless. Great location, right in the heart of Union Square!"
11,2202,"Oct 23 2009 	Business--just work.	I stayed three nights at the Villa Florence. The staff are very helpful and courtous. I was seranaded each night by a sax player outside on the corner; if noise bothers you, ask for an interiour room. The bell hops and front desk were very helpfull in arranging transportation back to the airport and providing directions. They go out of their way to ensure you understand where you want to go and how to get there. The location is excellent. It is near lots of shopping and only a few minutes to lots of public transit including the cable cars. I would go back again, just gotta find the time!"
12,2202,"Oct 23 2009 	A glimpse of luxury but not in our room.	Like others, I read the reviews on here and was excited about having a night in this location. After one night, however, I'm sure that there must be other places a little further away from Union Square with much more appeal.We arrived early, hoping to store our bags for the day. Instead, we were told that we could check in but that the room was at the front of the building, so could be a bit noisy. In hindsight, I should have remembered the statements on Tripadvisor about the noise and turned it down - so I'm partly to blame for my complaint. We're usually able to sleep through most things and didn't mind one night, but it was so loud! It felt like there wasn't a window between us and outside at all.Aside from that, our room was cosy and the hotel was convenient for the BART and restaurants. The bathroom was a little old and battered, but it was easy to ignore. They also tried to sting us with ridiculous phone charges for calls that couldn't be connected, but luckily (after some strong words on check out), these were cleared. We're still waiting for the refund back onto our credit card though."
13,2202,"Oct 21 2009 	I LOVED IT	I was attending a wedding and only in the city for one night, therefore I was looking for an inexpensive one night stay. My expectations of the Villa Florence was a noisy, Union Square hotel. Much to my surprise, the Villa Florence is a gem in the rough. Clean, charming, great staff and very little street noise at night, with wonderfully appointed rooms. I actually LOVED it! I will recommend the Villa Florence and return again."
14,2202,"Oct 21 2009 	Perfect place to stay for the Nike Marathon	Our Junior suite was perfect for the 4 of us. We were there only a few days, but the hotel's location was PERFECT for the Nike Marathon's event at Union Square. No rental cars were necessary from the airport since we were able to take BART which was located just a few blocks away. There were lots of restaurants and great shopping opportunities."
15,2202,"Oct 20 2009 	Great hotel. Small rooms.	It could just have been my room, but I got a room with a queen sized bed and the room itself was just rather small. You would figure that when you're on vacation, the last place you want to spend most of your time is in a hotel room, which is normally true, but when reviewing this hotel before I stayed here, it just sounded like such a grand luxiourious place to stay, and though it was decorated very nicely, my room was just very tiny.It also smells like your grandmothers house. No offense to grandmothers. This is a very historic town and the buildings I understand are very &quot;historic&quot; or &quot;vintage&quot;, rather, just plain old, so there is that oldness smell in the rooms and hallway that I really didn't care for. If you're into old historic places then this place would be terrific for you!"
16,2202,"Oct 15 2009 	Affordable luxury	Our experience at the Villa Florence was truly 5 star. We came nearly 3 hours before check-in and asked if we would store our bags there. They were so accommodating and actually let us check-in that early since a room was ready! The room we stayed in was on the smaller side, but we were only staying one night and didn't need that much space. It was extremely clean and comfortable and had an excellent view of the main street below. They did not skimp on the products in the bathroom, either! When we got back to the hotel after dinner we grabbed a glass of wine in the lobby bar. They had a nice wine list and the prices were fair. The staff were friendly and helpful, but did not disturb us or the other guests much...they just let everyone enjoy themselves and were there if you needed them.We would definitely recommend the Villa Florence and we are looking forward to staying there when we head out to San Francisco next time!"
17,2202,"Oct 15 2009 	Great Service and Location	Charming hotel right in Union Square. The room was very nice and clean. They graciously upgraded our room and gave us a complimentary botle of wine because it was our anniversary. We thought that was really sweet!!The only problem initially was valet service. It seemed to be hectic initially bc everyone was checking in. I guess all I can recommend to valets are their non verbal expressions. IWe understand you're stressed but don't get too flustered. We almost saw one valet run over an old woman. :S Oh, there was a small technical difficulty with our fridge in our room. For some reason the only way we could open it was when my husband actually lifted the desk..but not worries. We really, really enjoyed our stay. It was really fantastic and we will defintely come again!!!Thanks for giving us a memorable anniversary VIlla Florence!!"
18,2202,"Oct 13 2009 	Not worth the money and falsely advertised	We booked this hotel based in part on the stellar reviews, but we were sorely disappointed. We got to the hotel early and were told that our room was not ready, but they would call us when it was. We waited until the proper check in time and went back. The room was ready, but no one had bothered to contact us. We were shown to our room, which was quite a disappointment. We were told promptly by the bellhop that the internet probably would not work in our room, but we could come to the lobby. This is directly opposite of their advertisements, but it wasn't a killing point, so we moved on. We also did not get cell phone reception in the room, but we were still trying to overlook these issues.The bathroom was a total mess. It was extremely tiny, which would not have been a big issue if it had been visually pleasant. Instead it was dingy, poorly lit and dirty. The tub had dark, unattractive stains on it, not at all something you would expect from such an expensive hotel. To add insult to injury, it was supposed to be a &quot;deluxe king,&quot; but the bed was clearly a queen. We contacted the front desk, and they proceeded to give us room keys to other &quot;king&quot; rooms. They also had the same sized beds, although they did seem cleaner. We were never explained if we were being given the option to change rooms or just see that they didn't offer king beds. Finally, we spoke with the manager who told us that these beds were &quot;their kings.&quot; There was no apology, just simply the explanation that they have king beds different than other hotels. I asked why they have special beds, and she just gave a few snarky comments, such as &quot;You should see our doubles&quot; and &quot;Usually we have Europeans and they don't complain.&quot; After directly asking what she can do to remedy the situation, she did not offer a discounted rate or any sort of complimentary service. (I would have been fine just being charged the queen rate.) Her only solution was allowing us to break our reservation without a penalty. We eventually did find other lodgings (more on principle than anything else, as we were feeling disgusted by the general lack of concern for the issue at hand.) After leaving the hotel and being promised we would not be charged, we discovered a $700-plus hold was put on our credit card (a couple hundred more than the entire cost of the stay). To top it off, two days later the manager herself called to ask if we were still planning on checking in. Very unprofessional and disorganized."
19,2202,"Oct 12 2009 	The Best!!!	My daughter and I went into the city to celebrate her 14th birthday. It was one of the best stays I have ever experienced! The staff went above and beyond. The front staff made my daughter's birthday one to remember!! The room was fabulous as well. Great beds....The restaurant was very, very nice. I couldn't have asked for a better all around stay! Thanks for everything!!"
20,2202,Oct 12 2009 	First class hotel	We loved this hotel. The lobby was buzzing with people using the bar/restaurant/coffee bar or lounging in the comfy chairs. Very smart! But bar and cafe a bit pricey - be warned. Staff at reception and concierge were fantastically friendly and helpful and welcoming. Room was super. Looks like the official photos but just a little bit shabbier but this didn't diminish our satisifaction. And yes rooms are small but then they always tend to be in cities. We asked for a front facing high-up room so we could enjoy the sounds of the street and the views - pictures uploaded show these - and we got just that on 7th floor. Internal rooms also available for those who prefer the quiet. We nearly booked the Serrano and went to have a look to compare and were glad we didnt; it's location isnt as good and the lobby was reallly just that - no activity and not nearly as smart. Didn't check the rooms but duffice to xay we were delighted with our choice. Villa Florence is also right on Union Square and we walked everywhere from there including the water front so the locationis also first class. Will definately stay there again should we return to SF. Need I say more?
21,2202,"Oct 8 2009 	We love this hotel!!	My husband and I visited SF for two nights, took a road trip to Monterey for 4 nights, then returned for 1 more night. We stayed all 3 nights in SF at Villa Florence. This was a fantastic place to stay. We requested an internal quiet room which we received. It was the quietest room we have ever had - which is saying something considering the Union Square area can be very noisy. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. The location was ideal - easy access to cable cars, bus routes and within walking distance if you like to walk. We would absolutely stay here again."
22,2202,Oct 8 2009 	wonderful stay	This hotel deserves a high mark for service and atmosphere. We wanted a hotel that was indicative to the area-not a chain hotel and its exactly that! Charming hotel with a wonderful attentive staff in a great location-on Powell St. next to Union Square. Since were a family of 4 we needed a larger room than what is mostly offered in San Francisco so we booked the Jr. Suite-great choice with plenty of room.
23,2202,"Oct 5 2009 	Just perfect for the price""	&quot;From the comfortable rooms to the excellent coffee shop and restaurant, to the exceptional service, this hotel is superb. There is a constant buzz, warm and friendly atmosphere and excellent location - we will be back&quot;"
24,2202,"Oct 5 2009 	Excellent hotel and location.	My two daughters and I spent a long weekend in San Fran and after much research selected Villa Florence as our hotel. We were not disappointed. The hotel staff is friendly, efficient and very helpful. We had a junior suite which worked out very nicely for the three of us. The rooms were spacious and clean. We asked for extra towels and they were brought up promptly. This is a great location in Union Square, transportation is just outside the door. We flew in from Oakland A/P and took Bart to the hotel. It was within easy walking distance from Bart. The trolley cars are right outside the door. We went to the theater on Saturday and it was very close as well. We walked to China town for shopping and dinner...Just a perfect location. I would highly recommend."
25,2202,"Oct 1 2009 	Better than I even hoped it would be!	After spending a huge amount of time looking at reviews for the best hotels at the best price, I found this one. The management is doing everything possible to make sure that all is well cared for, clean, pleasant and beautiful. I read many good reviews about this hotel and I am adding to the collection! I want to go again and finish seeing all of San Francisco one day, and I will surely return."
26,2202,"Sep 30 2009 	Lovely hotel and great location	My wife and I spent 5 nights at Villa Florence. We chose the hotel based on comments we read from others who had stayed, plus we got a great deal through Expedia.ca. We found the location ideal as right in the heart of Union Square with the cable cars going right by the front door. We took the suggestion of someone who had stayed and asked for an inside room. No noise from the street but there is also no view at all, but good trade-off. The room while not big was very nicely decorated and comfortable with a large flat screen TV. There is a mini-bar and a safe in the room. I don't think it matters where you stay in the city, there are homeless on every street corner but they don't bother you except for asking for handouts. No need for a car as all the major stores within an easy walk and numerous restaurants. Our tip for first time visitors to the city is don't stand in the long line for a cable car ride. Buy your ticket, then walk up a few blocks and wait for it to come to you. It stops at every intersection. An alternate method to Fisherman's Wharf is the F-line trolley on Market St. For $2.00/person, it will take you to the Wharf, Pier 39 (shopping), Pier 33 (Alcatraz tour)."
27,2202,"Sep 30 2009 	Great place to stay	Villa Florence was more than we expected. Check in was a breeze and the staff were wonderful. Our room was spacious and very very clean as was the bathroom. There was always an &quot;hello&quot; each time we passed the receiption desk which made us feel special. Not only is the location perfect for a San Francisco visit, but the free internet was an added bonus, as we didn't travel with a computer and were able to keep in contact with our family and friends in Australia."
28,2202,"Sep 29 2009 	Great service and wonderful location	We recently spent 2 nights at the Villa Florence. What could have been a real mess with our reservation was handelled quickly, efficiently and courteously. We had separate reservations for the 2 nights and were unable to combine the reservations so we did not have to change rooms. Leta at the front desk did this so nicely. We will be staying at the Villa Florence again in December. The hotel goes out of its way to be of service. Great location, close to Union Square, great restaurants that are in walking distance, and live theatre within walking distance."
29,2202,Sep 29 2009 	It was wonderful	The hotel was more than I expected. It was special because we were looking for wedding dresses for my friend and walking in the Susan G. Komen Breast cancer race on Sunday.
30,2202,"Sep 28 2009 	Excellent Service Perfect Location and Clean Beautiful Rooms	The Villa Florence is located near Union Square in downtown San Francisco. The location is great because the trolley car, cabs and bus service is located right outside the hotel. The restaurant inside the hotel is wonderful. The service is great and the food is wonderful. Everyone is really friendly, too. I traveled with my husband, sister and her husband, and they were all very impressed with the hotel. I have stayed at other large hotels in the past, but I liked the warm and friendly atmosphere at the Villa Florence. It is a classy hotel."
31,2202,"Sep 28 2009 	Ideal location!	We booked during a special and were very pleased. Location was perfect; shopping, food, access to trains, buses, cabs, cable cars. Eay ride to Fishermans Wharf. Close to BART. Small rooms, but we just needed it for sleeping and showering. Neat and tidy. Took a gamble on a boutique hotel over a name brand and very happy we did!"
32,2202,Sep 21 2009 	Loved this Hotel	We booked online for our anniversary. We stayed in a junior suite which was very spacious and comfortable. The room was clean and quiet. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The location in Union Square is the best. One of the best hotels I have stayed in!
33,2202,Sep 15 2009 	brilliant	My friend and I stayed in a junior suite for a week. We got a really good deal via another website and could not have been more delighted. The room was great and when we checked in the receptionist made sure we were in a quiet room (even though we did not ask). The hotel generally was lovely with a good bar and restaurant and very placed for seeing San Francisco. The staff in particular made this hotel stand out. Nothing was too much trouble and this was all staff from the reception staff who gave great advice on shopping to the cleaners who did a great job and thanked us for making the bed!
34,2202,"Sep 9 2009 	Loved everything about it	My Husband and I booked this hotel on hotwire for our anniversary and were very very happy with everything. The staff the room, the location, the price - they all were fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future. Plus, the room has a/c, which was important while we were there since they had unseasonably warm weather for most of the days we visited, and our cab driver said that a lot of hotels don't have a/c. The little restaurant next to the hotel was great - Bellini? I think it was called. Great coffee, good breakfast sandwiches to go, etc. The only negative was the amount of homeless in the area, but that's pretty common in San Francisco from what I could tell. Otherwise, a great experience that I would highly recommend."
35,2202,Sep 8 2009 	beatuiful hotel	This was my first time staying here but it will not be the last. it was a great room and very quite for the location of the hotel. the staf was the best at any hotel i have ever stayed.
36,2202,"Sep 4 2009 	I just booked my return for next month--LOVED IT	What a lovely hotel. The renovation is beautiful, the restaurant (Kuleto's) is excellent, and the location is right in the thick of all that makes SF unique--cable cars, union square, theatres. Our interior room was extremely quiet and comfortable (we requested it to avoid street noise). But what really compelled me to write this review (my first ever) is how extremely personable and attentive every single staff member is. They must be treated really well because they all seemed to really enjoy their jobs and went out of their way to accommodate our every request."
37,2202,"Aug 31 2009 	Great location.	The Villa Florence is definitely a beautiful hotel. The staff was a bit rushed and not very attentive, but they were busy so no harm done.The rooms are gorgeous. Very very spacious and plush. Huge tv, nice size desk, and a wonderful little chair and ottoman with still plenty of space to roam around.The bathroom, on the other hand, is very small. This didn't really bother us much, but figured I'd mention it in case it's a selling point for any one else. All in all it was a very nice stay, the restaurant looked pretty good but we opted out and went to the Daily Grill around the corner instead. Great food there. Not meaning any disrespect to the on site restaurant, just didn't try it.All in all a pretty good stay, although if you're looking for a view this one's not for you, we were looking onto a rooftop with views of another building. Once again, only important if the view is the selling point. Perfect location and great value. It only lost a star because we stayed at the Chancellor just down the road and that hotel was a lot more hospitable and, to me, more charming as well."
38,2202,"Aug 31 2009 	lovely rooms amazing location but please wash the carpet in the corridors	we honeymooned here in August or 3 nights. Hotel staff very friendly but service at the restaurant just awful. our room was nice, with a very large and confortable kind size bed. instead corridors and lifts look very old and not particular clean...avoid rooms on the main street otherwise you will enjoy pop music from the pub downstairs all night long."
39,2202,"Aug 30 2009 	Great Stay	We spent 4 nights there in August. Having stayed at the Villa Florence 3 years ago we hoped that the excellent service and fine facilities would be the same. To our surprise they were even better under new ownership. The staff is always friendly and willing to offer assistance. If wifi is a priority make sure that you test out the room before you check in. It didn't work in my first room but they had no problem moving me. The fitness room was adequate. What we really enjoy about the Villa Florence is it's central location and proximity to the cable car, bus and Bart systems. There are restaraunts repesenting every ethnic group possible within walking distance. The Union Square location means that there is always action outside of the hotel so make sure that you ask for a room facing the inside. Those rooms are extremely quiet."
40,2202,"Aug 26 2009 	It's overated	The location is excellent. It's one step away from Union Square, and very close to the cable car station. The restaurant attached to the hotel has excellent food &amp; services. However, if you are going for a business trip, you might need to reconsider. I confirmed with the front desk that the hotel provides free WiFi access throughout the hotel and in all rooms. However, during my 4 nights stay in the hotel, the WiFi never worked in my room. The front desk people asked me to use the computers in the business center, but there's always a long line-up. The WiFi in the lobby didn't work properly either. Also, the service was horrible. Even though the hotel couldn't deliver what was promised, the lady at front desk refused to do a room rate adjustment (because my trip was booked via Expedia). She didn't even offer me a complimentary breakfast the next day. Also, the rooms might look really nice in the pictures in the official website, the ceilings in the room I stayed definitely needs to be repainted."
41,2202,"Aug 26 2009	Wonderful atmosphere in a historic building	Great rooms, staff is awesome. Make sure to eat at Kuletos, WONDERFUL food and bartenders are teriffic!!! Perfectly located in downtown San Fran. Highly recommend."
42,2202,"Aug 26 2009 	One of the best places I have stayed so far...	Truly, this is an outstanding hotel, in the heart of SF, great service, great rooms, great people....don't miss this if you are in S Francisco..."
43,2202,"Aug 25 2009	Exceptional Hotel in a great San Francisco location	Stayed two nights in the Junior Suite with my sister and niece and the room was very comfortable for three people and there was plenty of room for suitcases and wine cases brought back from Napa. The hotel staff were very helpful with directions, suggestions, etc. I love the convenience and quality of the restaurant Kuleto and Bar Norcino in the lobby. The location is perfect in Union Square and close to great restaurants, shopping and sights. The lobby is beautiful and the renovated room decor is really nice. Don't hesitate to stay at this lovely hotel."
44,2202,"Aug 25 2009 	The SF's Hotel where to stay	Excellent hotel, very well located near almost everything....customer-oriented personel, the rooms are OK, the service is at a good standard level, the restaurant and the bar are also providing good food...One negative point : it smells something bad in the corridors...can be repaired I hope."
45,2202,"Aug 23 2009 	Great location ambience but choose your room carefully	The location couldn't be better. The two most popular cable car routes pass outside, a few minutes walk from the BART station bringing you in from the airport.and just down from Union Square. First impressions are good also. Large airy foyer helped by the fact that the Coffee Shop is open to the street.Very happy with the room and bathroom, both of which were nicely furnished (huge TV) and the bathroom especially did have that Italian feel as advertised. However....we couldn't get the internet in our room. The hotel's technical support (very helpful) said it was probably because we were at one end of the hotel. We needed to be nearer the center. I managed by sitting on the central stairway or down in the Business Center. Funnily enough I did manage to weakly connect to the neighboring Hotel's system.The crunch came our first night. Although you do expect some noise in a central city location the patrons of the Irish Pub across the road were obviously in great spirits until the early hours of the morning. If this wasn't bad enough deliveries to the various establishments began before 6.00 a.m. at least two of which consisted what sounded like emptying of recycling dumpsters from a great height. Coupled with the lack of internet in our room we asked to be moved. Quality double glazing would have eliminated this problem.The Hotel staff were very understanding. The new room didn't have a view (but one not needed), was quiet and had a strong internet connection. The only thing I'd say was that compared with our first room, the bathroom was tiny - twice the width of the tub and only about a foot longer. For us personally quiet nights and internet were more important than a large bathroom so we were happy. I strongly suggest you make your room preferences known to the Hotel when you book.We used the Hotel Coffee Shop for breakfast most mornings. Very good and prices comparable to establishments elsewhere in the area. Treated ourselves to breakfast in the restaurant one morning and, again, this was good and no more expensive than elsewhere. We didn't have dinner in the Hotel Restaurant but noticed that it was full every evening so probably would have tried it if we were staying longer.No doubt we would stay at the same Hotel again and, with the proviso above, would thoroughly recommend it to fellow Travelers."
46,2202,"Aug 18 2009 	Fantastic hotel - perfect location excellent quality great value!	We stayed at the Villa Florence for 7 nights during a recent trip to the USA West Coast. Usually when travelling, we stay in hostels and budget hotels but chose to splash out a bit on this holiday and we certainly weren't disappointed! Booked the hotel through hotels.com and managed to get a brilliant deal so check out this when you're booking. The hotel is located within very easy walking distance from the BART so arriving from the international airport and getting the train into the city was very easy. The main lobby was elegant, and staff very accomodating. We were given a street facing room - despite facing one of the main roads in the city, with the cable cars passing, it was incredibly quiet! Rooms were very tastefully decorated, with decent storage space. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but this would be my only criticism. One of the main shopping malls was down the street, with Union Square major department stores and plenty of restaurants on your doorstep. The cable car terminal, and F Line bus stops were metres from the front of the hotel making the location first class in terms of being able to get around to all the major attractions and visit the different neighbourhoods. The hotel lobby had two computers with free internet access for guests, and a great little fitness room again free to use. I would certainly recommend stopping here to friends. San Francisco was a great city with eateries and attractions to match all budgets and i felt the Hotel Villa Florence was the perfect hotel for our holiday."
47,2202,"Aug 18 2009 	Great location Great experience	My family spent six nights at the Villa Florence and found it was a good location since it was located near all of the city's transportation -- cable cars right outside on Powell St., numerous bus lines, three blocks from the historic street cars and also the BART station. There were many restaurants and high-end shopping nearby and Chinatown was within a short few minute walk away. We were also near a couple of movie theaters, each with stadium seating, one also had an IMAX Theater. The hotel room was comfortable, beautifully renovated with a huge flat-screen t.v. It was more than we could have hoped for. The concierge was not extremely helpful when we asked for a Sunday brunch venue -- it turned out to be closed. I really loved the happy hour at the wine bar from 5 to 7 p.m. They open up the front window to create a sidewalk cafe and the $5 glass of moscato wine was superb. The only drawback to the area is the large number of highly agressive homeless people/beggars. They are in your face and nasty. We did not see one police officer in the area during our entire stay. I would definitely stay there again, if I could get a bargain rate like I did this time."
48,2202,Aug 18 2009 	Just Okay...	This was our first trip to San Francisco. We chose Villa Florence because we got a &quot;good deal&quot; on Expedia. The lobby of the hotel was beautiful. After we checked in we went to our room only to find someone was still in it. We went down stairs and were given another room. The room we had was a king delux room. We weren't really impressed with the room at all. The set up was quite akward. You couldn't lie on the bed and see the tv and the room size was a typical boutique size. As far as the &quot;free&quot; wi-fi goes what a joke. The connection is horrible if you do manage to even get connected. Another plus is the La' Occitaine bath products in the rooms! The location of the hotel to public transit was nice. If you are in SF for shopping its the perfect location. The only bad thing about the location of the hotel was proximity to the Tenderloin district and the amount of homeless people in the area. We sat outside for breakfast and we were asked 6 times in 20 minutes for money. Not good. All in all this is just an okay hotel. I wouldn't stay there again.
49,2202,"Aug 13 2009 	Charming European Elegance in the Heart of San Francisco	I took my wife with me to a conference recently and we stayed at the Villa Florence for the first time. What a wonderful experience! The rooms were elegant, the location on Union Square perfect, and the staff made every detail a pleasure. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. The hotel has easy access to the Bart, the San Francisco metro, cable cars, trolleys and buses. If you arrive at either San Francisco International or Oakland International, the Bart will take you right to the Powell Street Station which is only three blocks from the hotel. We took the Bart each way and saved almost $100 in ground transportation costs from the airport. Villa Florence reminded us of the hotel where we stayed in Florence, Italy a few years ago on a second honeymoon."
50,2202,"Aug 12 2009 	An excellent well kept hotel with very helpful staff	We stayed for four nights in early August. We had a very pleasant stay with a lovely room on the 7th floor on the inside of the building which was excellent as Powell Street is central street in SF. Check-in was seemless, the room was a very nice size and the bathroom had a bath which was a nice surprise. The rooms are very clean and the beds comfortable. The hotel was very busy however the staff always seemed to find time to be friendly and efficient in dealing with requests. On the downside, the internet access is not up to scratch. For wireless there were intermittant problems which need to be fixed. For breakfast outside the hotel I recommend Sears Cafe (nothing to do with the retailer) which is two blocks up on the left across from Union Square."
51,2202,Aug 11 2009 	Excellent Choice	I stayed at the Villa Florence for 5 nights for a girls getaway. The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing. It is half a block from Union Square. The cable car turnaround is less than a five minute walk. Our deluxe double double room was very nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. The room was a good size for a city hotel. I really liked the complimentary bath products. I would definitely stay there again.
52,2202,"Aug 11 2009	Elegant touch of old and new Italian style	I read some reviews that said lot about the noisyness of Villa Florence because of the location. I was little worried so I called your hotel your staff who informed me that my reservation is with &quot;Junior Suite&quot; , that I had nothing to worry about. Well, it was true and it was fabulous."
53,2202,"Aug 10 2009 	Fabulous hotel it has everything: location service 	We went for a birthday weekend, checking in and out was very easy. No problems with service at all. I loved our room it was clean and classy. The beds were very comfy, and the bathrooms were very nice. It was great that they checked our bags for us so that we were able to shop."
54,2202,"Aug 7 2009 	A great place to stay in San Francisco	The Villa Florence is in an excellent location, really close to Union Square and cable car terminus. We found the hotel staff to be extremely helpful in giving advice regarding transport tickets, directions, etc. There are plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance of the hotel. The kingsize rooms are very good and, as suggested by someone else, we requested quieter rooms away from Market and Powell. Valet parking service was very good - I saw cheaper parking within a few blocks of the Villa Florence, but we liked the flexibility of no in/out restrictions that valet parking gave us. It was only on the first day of our trip that we encountered a problem stopping outside the hotel - drove around the block a couple of times until a space opened up - otherwise, absolutely fine."
55,2202,"Aug 3 2009 	Very nice and clean and comfortable good location	Other than the slanted floor , reno's worked very well to show an improved room, very clean and maintained.."
56,2202,Aug 2 2009 	Great place to stay!	We stayed in one of the Jr. suites for 6 days recently. The location was wonderful - right down from Union Square and a block away from the Cable Car turn around. We had plenty of room for three people and were very pleased with the layout of the room and the luxurious bed linens. We had requested a room away from the street and it was unbelievably quiet - we never heard a sound. Staff were very helpful and professional. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. The only issue was a problem with the wi-fi - poor connectivity as we were on the top floor but staff immediately offered to move us to another room. We declined and decided to live without the laptop as our room was so comfortable and quiet and we had computer access in the business center.
57,2202,Jul 30 2009 	Enjoyed our stay	Loved the hotel. Wonderful people who take great care and pride in their job. Amenities were fabulous. Would stay there again. Wish Larkspur had hotels on the East coast.
58,2202,"Jul 29 2009 	Classic SF Hotel - continues to be a favorite for our family	We just returned home from a great California adventure trip (we live in CA) planned around seeing the show Wicked in SF. Once tickets were secured the next thing I did was book a Jr. Suite at the Villa Florence where we have stayed before. It doesn't disappoint. There are so many things we love about it aside from it's location (right off of Union Square). This time we stayed three nights and found the staff especially attentive to our every need. The bellmen are some of the best in the city I am certain.We ate at Kuleto's for breakfast with friends and as usual it was fabulous, after seeing the show we enjoyed a cheese and salami plate with wine at the recently added Bar Norcini. The person who helped us was very knowledgeable about varieties and parings. We love the European feel of this hotel as it reminds us of other travels - there is a quaintness that I have come to appreciate and look forward to. This is NOT a huge hotel with vast spaces and expansive halls. The rooms are well furnished, the beds and linens are very comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and well appointed - but the facilities are not expansive. You will be comfortable and it is surprisingly quiet for a hotel in the middle of the city. Excellent value."
59,2202,"Jul 28 2009 	Great atmosphere and great value.	I have stayed at the Villa Florence twice in the last 3 months. It is super charming, clean, and had great rates."
60,2202,Jul 28 2009 	great ambience- great staff very accommodating	very elegant. Staff is very professional and accomodating.
61,2202,"Jul 27 2009 	Great hotel at the perfect SF location	We arrived with my elderly mom, and found that the Jr. Suite didn't accomodate her. Within a few minutes, the front desk staff had changed the room (on a sold out night) so that she could be settled in. Everyone was great, and the restaurant has excellent meals!"
62,2202,"Jul 23 2009 	Great place to tour San Francisco	Location is great,we only had two nights in SF and this hotel was the perfect base, right next to the tram line and just around the corner from union square. Check-in was swift and polite and the rooms were vey clean and nice. Lovely deco with a colonial feel and crisp linen. The room faced the front of the building and could get a little noisy with tram bells and party goers, so if a quiter room is required request one away from the front. This was the start of a sightseeing tour of the southwest USA so the excitement took away the annoyance of being woken up by party goers and trambells etc. We didnt eat in the resturant but it did look very nice. On the whole a lovely hotel with a great feel and great start to our holiday."
63,2202,Jul 23 2009 	Great value boutique hotel	Great location close to Powell Street trolley turn and Union Square. Room small but well fitted and with free wifi - large walk in wardrobe. I had a room at the back which was quiet but dark. Shower room small and functional. The restaurant next door (Kuletos) is fabulous for breakfast and dinner - seafood risotto was superb. Really good value for money for a central city location.
64,2202,"Jul 21 2009 	A Perennial Winner near Union Square	We have stayed at the Villa Florence repeatedly for over 20 years and it is consistently our favorite hotel in San Francisco. Under its new management the renovated rooms have been elegantly and tastefully furnished, including the addition of a large screen flat panel TV (with DVD player) in each and the provision of L'Occitane products in the bath. It's convenient Union Square location, as well as its welcoming and caring staff are complemented by a top flight restaurant on the premises - Kuleto's, where a meal is mandatory at least once. In a city where there are many lodging choices at every price point, this gem delivers everything you could reasonably desire in a hotel: convenience, a caring and efficient staff, comfort and good value. Highly recommended."
65,2202,"Jul 20 2009 	Good location on Union Square	Nice hotel with a great location right on Union Square. Plenty of good restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Catch the cable car right outside the hotel for the waterfront. Older, smallish but very comfortable rooms but an elegant hotel lobby. Staff was excellent and very helpful."
66,2202,"Jul 17 2009 	Nice hotel great location	This hotel was a great location to base our trip to San Francisco from. Great location to trolley/cable cars.Wonderful restaurant and great coffee shop/wine bar in the lobby. Comfy beds to rest from the long days of shopping/sightseeing. We had a room facing Powell Street, perhaps a bit noisey from the street cars and the passersby, even into the early morning hours, might be better to request a room located away from Powell. Overall, a nice hotel, we would stay there again."
67,2202,"Jul 14 2009 	Renovated Boutique Charmer	We chose this hotel after careful review of TripAdvisor.com. We stayed at Villa Florence for approx. two weeks (helping my daughter plan her upcoming wedding) and could not have been more pleased. The staff is friendly and professional. It is a &quot;green&quot; hotel, newly refurbished. It is well situated with every type of public transportation within steps. Would readily choose this hotel again for our next visit."
68,2202,"Jul 13 2009 	Great hotel that is perfectly situated in the city	We stayed for 4 nights with other friends from England. The hotel is perfectly placed for sight seeing and about a 30 second walk from Union Square and all the shops. Also the cable cars run right along the street in front of the hotel.The room we had was very nicely fitted out with a massive flat panel TV and ipod doc etc. It was spacious enough for us and certainly we had no problems with traffic noise etc. (although we were at the back of the hotel) The bathroom was very small but again nicely fitted out. The staff were the hotels great strength though we thought, as nothing seemed to be too much trouble. This was our first time in San Francisco and we loved the hotel and how perfectly situated it was for all the tourist hot spots. By the way if you want a recommendation for breakfast, we really liked a place called the Olympic Cafe which is a five minute walk from the hotel (turn left out of the front door and then first left and keep walking). It's not high class, but if you want a good value, typically American diner type meal, it's worth a try."
69,2202,Jul 11 2009 	Great Choice	I echo many of the good comments here about the Villa Florence. I opted for a stay here while attending a conference at a nearby big-chain hotel. The Villa Florence offered the peace and quiet of a boutique hotel while giving up none of the amenities. Plus they dont nickel and dime you for every little service. (WIFI is free for example). Staff was courteous. Bar and restaurant great. Id stay again.
70,2202,"Jul 9 2009 	Simply: Lovely Hotel Helpful Staff and Good Location	We stayed for a week at Villa Florence, I asked for a quiet room which we got. The lobby is beautiful and the business center was very useful to print off tickets etc from. Housekeeping were very quick and polite. My only complaint is very small, unfortunately, we had a room that looked straight out onto another window about 3metres away. Though it didn't spoil the holiday, I would recommend this hotel for its lovely rooms and very handy location. It is right next to Macy's and a very short walk to Union SquareInsider Tip: There is a cable car stop on Powell and Geary Street (right by the hotel) wait there to catch the car to Fishermans Wharf and Chinatown- if you go all the way to the bottom the queues are unbelievable! Just hop on to the car when it stops at the intersection, have your ticket or fare ready and be on your way. This tip saved us a VERY long time waiting in queues!Stay away from: The Mini Bar (Silly expensive), Kuletos the restaurant inside the hotel (the staff were great but the food was extremely over-priced and not worth the money), Be careful of the many homeless people out on the streets, they are all over San Francisco and to be honest you can't get away from them. Go to: Next door to the Hotel there was a good little place for breakfast, The Cheesecake Factory nearby inside Macy's always a queue but wonderful food for reasonable prices. Opposite Macys many of the sight seeing buses can be boarded and used, these will take you all round the attractions and then bring you back."
71,2202,"Jul 8 2009 	Always a Good Place to Stay and Getting Better	We have been staying at the Villa Florence on visits to San Francisco for ten years. I believe that this is our fourth stay. It has always been a classy hotel in a good location.This visit, to our delight, we found larger, remodeled rooms under the new ownership/management. A good place got even better.The staff is frieindly and attentive without being intrusive. The location is ideal -- you go out the front door into the bustle of San Francisco with easy access to all forms of public transit. The rates are reasonable. If there is something not to like about the Villa Florence, it has escaped our attention."
72,2202,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Hotel!	Stayed here for a 5 day conference at the Moscone Center. The hotel was elegant, staff was helpful and the location was a hot spot. Located in Union Square, I could walk to prime shopping locations and premiere bars and night clubs. Great location, right in the hub of international travelers."
73,2202,"Jul 1 2009 	Excellent friendly employees with great location	This hotel is in great location close to Union Square, and all the major shopping areas. The employees are attentive, friendly and provides excellent service. And the room is very clean with nice amenities. Strongly recommended for leisure or business stay. Cheers"
74,2202,"Jul 1 2009 	Classic botique hotel gets it right with its Green and no smoking initiatives""	I spent only one night at this eclectic hotel in the heart of Union Square. The room was spacious and reminiscent of a quaint 40's style studio I once rented on Nob Hill back in the late 70s. Although older in style, this hotel doesn't lack the modern conveniences. 50&quot; plasma TV, travertine tile bath rooms, fresh robes and real wood shutters, not plastic! The staff is very accommodating and friendly, catering to your every need.Their Green and no smoking policy puts them right up there in the environmentally conscious category. The little coffee and cafe bar is magic. The menu sports Italian wines, gourmet pastries and a variety of cheeses and dried meats. While enjoying a glass of wine, I struck up a conversation with another patron whose name turned out to be the same as mine (not a common name either). And we both shared birthdays under the same Zodiac sign. When a social experience like that happens, I attribute it to the surroundings and the good energy the atmosphere creates.I would highly recommend this little gem."
75,2202,Jun 30 2009 	I love this place!	What a great hotel! Excellent location on Powell Street right in Union Square --if you are a shopper you will be in heaven! The service was great from the valet people to the front desk receptionists to the housekeeping staff. I don't think I walked by one staff member that did not greet me with a hello or a good morning. The rooms are pretty small but very cozy (same with the bathroom) and CLEAN! The L'Occitane toiletries were an extra treat! Ask for an interior room to keep street noise at a minimum at night. The fitness room is small but has everything you will need to get a thorough workout. This was my second stay at the Villa Florence and the experience was better than the first -- I will definitely be back!
76,2202,"Jun 25 2009 	Very comfortable and the perfect location	Some friends and I recently stayed at the Villa Florence on our weekend getaway to San Francisco. It was the perfect location and so comfortable. The rooms are beautiful, the furnishings and color choices are great. You can tell that the building is historic, but everything has been updated so nicely, that it is a perfect fit for San Francisco. The staff at this hotel are very freindly and courteous, and there is enough staff in the lobby at any given time to answer all of your questions. The location really couldn't be better. You are right in the heart of Union Square, and the cable car runs right up Powell street in front of the hotel. Once you are done with the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco, the Villa Florence is the perfect spot to come back to and relax. While the hotel is upscale, the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed, also our rooms on the 4th and 5th floor were very quiet. We will definitely stay there again and reccommend it to all of our friends."
77,2202,"Jun 24 2009	Truely a renaissance hotel. Quiet rooms helpful staff and a beautiful atmosphere!	Great location to most everything in SF. Had the feel of an old luxury hotel in europe. Liked the rooms, the amenities and especially the lighting in the bathrooms. The value was a plus, as well."
78,2202,"Jun 23 2009 	excellent choice	Great location, Very nice hotel.Clean and very good service.Happy with good choice!!!!!!!!!!"
79,2202,"Jun 20 2009 	nice place	The hotel is in a great location, being on a main street felt safe walking to and from hotel at night on my own., close to all types of public transport. The staff were polite, check in/out was a breeze. The room nicely furnished, it was actually bigger than what I was expecting after reading previous reviews. Would stay here again. Free internet is a real bonus considering how much other hotels charge."
80,2202,"Jun 9 2009 	Elegant European Friendly Great Place to Stay	The Villa Florence was an excellent choice, I did my homework and chose this hotel based on many criteria. The location is great, it's close proximity to MUNI makes it easy to get anywhere in the city very quickly. Union Sqare has great shopping, restaurants, and sightseeing. The hotel restaurant was excellent, it's listed in many best bet lists, the lobby bar was a real European treat too; they have a great selection of meats, cheeses and wines to have a late afternoon snack, the staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and fun. They also have a small selection of breakfast and lunch items at the lobby bar. The room was eleganly furnished, quiet, and comfortable, the bath was excellent as were the toiletries. The only drawback was the room was a bit small. No complaints, just observation, all in all I think it's a great hotel. I would go back again!"
81,2202,"Jun 2 2009 	Excellent Decision!	We just got back from a 3 day trip to San Fran and stayed the first night in the Villa Florence. We arrived early Saturday early afternoon, checked in with the very attentive, helpful valet and front desk. Our room was great, small but perfect for the 2 of us. We had a very full day planned in the city and by the time we arrived back at the hotel a peddler outside was playing a nursery rhyme that sent us both into a deep slumber. The bed was super comfy, nice amenities, great location, and the list goes on. Overall, I'm very please with the hotel and will be back in the future. Con; One reviewer mentioned a noisy room. Our room was noisy (my only complaint) but we were tired enough it didn't matter. May want to call the front desk to help with room designation prior."
82,2202,"Jun 2 2009 	Beautiful comfortable courteous clean best location and value.	This is our second time, we have stayed at the Villa Florence and it didn't disappoint us. The hotel is simply beautiful, the staff is very helpful courteous and fast, it counts a lot when you have an impatient toddler. The rooms are very clean, the beds have down comforters and pillow tops which makes you feel at home and get a perfect rest."
83,2202,"Jun 2 2009 	Great staff location and value	just came back from my first trip to San Francisco. I chose this hotel, based on price/quality ratio and the reviews. Initially, I was a little afraid to book with Expedia for a hotel based on the reviews since I couldn't change my mind once I reached there since it was already prepaid. Once I arrived, I was greeted by a most friendly front desk staff. The desk was located at the far end of the entry. One side had Kuleto's restaurant and at the other front side, there was some type of bar/cafe. The hotel elevators are small but there are two for only 7 floors. The hotel room itself was small as described by other travellers but it had all the amenities needed: large screen tv (for such a small room!), mini-bar fridge (I just used it to store things - if you want something from it, be sure to check expiry dates. There were some moldy tops on the soda cans and one coke from the Beijing olympics), room safe, iron and ironing board, hairdryer at the back of the bathroom door, a clock radio with ipod dock and phone with message light which wasn't working on mine - I couldn't pick up any messages but would flash if there was a message for me. There was no bathtub, only a shower stall but that was okay for me since I only take showers. The bathroom was renovated nicely but very small. The room was pretty clean except for a condom wrapper I found under the bed. There was free internet access at the back of the hotel which was super convenient for people who didn't bring a laptop and just wanted to send emails like me. They even had a printer to use. This was free for guests. Every morning, I got a newspaper hanging on my doorknob. Toiletries were from Occitane - soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, makeup pads, q-tips and a shower cap. Replaced daily by the maid if you hung the sign that said &quot;Come on in&quot;. We tipped her well every day. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. I think the pillow were down as was the comforter and mattress top. The room was quite clean. The bathroom was also very clean. There was room for a desk and a chair but it was cramped. Just enough room basically to walk around the bed. Must be what they mean by European style. Don't expect your usual large hotel room with a sitting area. The only complaints I had were that the hallways smelled mildewy and the heat/air conditioning was by window units which were noisy and I had to shut it off at night. We had an inside room so there was no street noise except for the occasional siren. Since it was an inside room, there was no view, only of other windows. My friend stayed at another hotel nearby which was much more older, no phone messaging, small tv, and the room was tiny and he paid more than me! The location was great! Near all the transit - trolley, street cars, metro (subway), shopping, large department stores like Macy's, Bloomingdales, Neiuman Marcus, Sak's Fifth Avenue. There's a large shopping mall right on Market Street down the street. It's right downtown and you can easily walk to Chinatown. Just a warning, avoid Ellis street. It is full of homeless people and smells strongly of urine especially west of Powell. All the staff I had contact with were really friendly and helpful. I took Lorrie's shuttle to the airport and they were early and helped me with my bag. I had a 5:30am pick up and he was there before I came downstairs at 5:20am to check out! I felt bad for the 5 people in the van waiting for me. Overall, I was very happy with this hotel."
84,2202,"May 29 2009 	A gem I'm afraid others will find out about.	The location was the draw. (O.K. and Kuleto's too). It completely sucked us in on every other appointment. A charming, nicely maintained room of larger than expected size. A thoughtful handwritten note and refreshment. Each staff member we encountered seemed happy to help us and happy to work there. Most of all, no one responded to us, &quot;no problem&quot;. Instead it was an appropriate, &quot;You're welcome&quot;. or &quot;Thank you&quot;. Refreshing . We will be back shortly."
85,2202,"May 29 2009 	Villa Florence is a wonderful hotel next to everything in San Francisco	I was very impressed with the Villa Florence Hotel. The day I arrived it was my Mother's birthday. When we checked into our rooms there was chocolate, wine and a birthday card greeting us, which was a very wonderful and thoughtful surprise. This being our first time in San Francisco we were very impressed. The rooms were nice and clean as well as the bathroom. The only thing I would change is if the bathroom could have been a little bigger. Overall this was an excellent hotel and the next time I come to San Francisco I will be staying at the Villa Florence Hotel."
86,2202,"May 28 2009 	Great little hotel excellent location friendly staff	Extremely easy to find the hotel, which is always one of my concerns after a long flight - you literally take the BART from the airport to Union Square, and walk for 1 minute up the road (full of shops/bars/restaurants!) and your their.We only had 2 days in San Francisco, and had a lot we wanted to see, and I cannot speak more highly of the staff; different members at different times were continuously friendly, pointing out the locations of places on our map, chatting to us about the quicker way to do things etc. The hotel itself was lovely; comfortable rooms, clean. Please note the rooms are not huge, but if your in San Fran why would you be spending your time in your room?! They make up for it with their cleanliness and decor.I would definatly return to this hotel."
87,2202,May 24 2009 	Villa Florence a bit of elegant charm and most welcoming staff.	Most impressed with the hospitality displayed by the entire staff. Rooms were immaculate!Pillow top beds and quiet rooms.
88,2202,"May 21 2009 	Mother's Day Overnight in the City	Love everything about this place....location, price, location, service, location...well, everything except parking. But there is something exciting about double parking on Powell Street on top of the cable car tracks to get valet service. Old-style building with really slow and small elevators but the room interiors have been nicely appointed and the beds are super comfortable. Great place for a late night lemoncello.Stayed here half a dozen times. Never been disappointed. Price is reasonable for San Francisco Union Square."
89,2202,May 19 2009 	Wonderful Place to Stay	I took my fiance for a romantic birthday weekend in San Fransisco. Our stay was everything we expected and more. The hotel is located downtown and within walking distance or trolly car ride away form everything. The room was quaint and cute and the staff very friendly and accomodating. We will stay here again!
90,2202,"May 12 2009 	A breath of fresh air	I stayed at the Villa Florence with my boyfriend this past weekend and we had a phenomenal time. The staff did such a wonderful job of accommodating our needs. To begin, we arrived early and they allowed us to check-in to our room early, which was awesome. When we arrived, I inquired about the evening wine tasting that I recall the hotel having (I have stayed at the Villa Florence before with my parents). They informed us that they no longer do this. I was bummed, but moved on without skipping a beat. When we arrived in our room, we received a call stating that we would be receiving a complimentary bottle of wine for our troubles. That was so thoughtful and really made us happy campers. Finally we went out in the city on Sunday and arrived back to the hotel late Sunday night. We had not yet eaten dinner and were having trouble finding an open restaurant. When we arrived at the hotel, we inquired about any local eateries that were open. The concierge gave us menus, and even called and ordered our pizza and salad for us! We were so grateful and felt so lucky to have such a caring hotel staff. We are looking forward to one day staying at the Villa Florence again. What a great trip we had, thanks to the Villa Florence Hotel!"
91,2202,"May 9 2009 	We got the right hotel.	This is our second visit to San Francisco and our first time to stay in the Union Square area. During our first visit, 2 years ago, we stayed in the vicinity of Fisherman's Wharf. I am so happy that I chose the right hotel for our brief stay in the city this year. Brief as this is just the first leg of our month long US vacation. The hotel's location is the best. Just a stone throw away from the Union Sq., along the Powell St. where the cable cars pass. Everything is so near. The big shops and stores, the Market, bus terminals, convenient stores and restaurants. And the staff are great especially the Filipinos. They are so warm and friendly. Our room is the best. We were given a corner room on the 7th floor w/c I think is the top floor. The room is spacious, clean and free of smell. Free coffee and newspapers everyday. There's a coffee shop and a restaurant in the lobby. And here's the catch. Free internet in the hotel lobby. There's even printer and lots of clean papers for printing. And an ATM machine too. You can not ask for more.We will surely go back to this hotel in our next visit to Sanfo. We just hope that the accommodation will be as pleasurable if not better. Maybe free breakfast?Thanks to Cora and Lita. The 2 Fiipinas who assisted us.More power to all of you!"
92,2202,"May 5 2009 	The hotel is excellent in all areas; service location and price.	The hotel is in an excellent location. The staff are exceptional, the rooms are very well done and my room was spacious, plus the price is perfect. In addition, Kuleto's and Bar Norcini are two great places for eating and drinking. I will book here again."
93,2202,"May 2 2009 	The rooms may be small buy the people are very friendly.	The room was rather small but the location was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Clarence (Conciere) and Albert (Bellman), were readily available to give you directions and advice, call you a cab or tell you where to get a cheap breakfast. The hotel's restruant was good Italian cuisne. I would stay there again."
94,2202,"May 2 2009 	Pleasant Stay	Had to take a test in San Fran and got a pretty good deal from Expedia on this hotel. Easy check in- free wireless high speed -I loved that! Interesting location fronting cable car route. Location is ideal for shoppers/museum visitors. Asked for and got room away from street noise, just could not figure out where the irritating hum, that seemed to go on all night, was coming from."
95,2202,"Apr 25 2009 	Would rather stay somewhere else in Union Square	I stayed here for a weekend rate of $123 plus Tax, I had a King Jr Suite (Maybe this is considered a suite, A King Bed and small seating area)ConsDesk Chair was broke and stuck in the lowest level.Unusual yellow rusty liquid came out of tub nozzle when shower was turned on.AC/Heat is a Window Unit and was level exactly at our heads while in Bed, no way to get the air from blowing directly on our faces while in Bed.Hotel is Very Old, lacks power outlets other than desk area.Bathroom had Mildew Small, probably from immovable shower head that sprays water against back of shower/wall.PROSNice Friendly StaffFree WiFiGreat LocationI personally would not stay here again, I am sure some of the other rooms are nicer than mine however currently there are some inexpensive rates at both of the Westin's in Union Square and Hotel Palomar, I would check to see the rates at those properties and if they are close to Villa Florence I would stay there instead."
96,2202,"Apr 19 2009 	Great SF Shopping Hotel	I arrived with my aunt to go shopping at Union Square SF. We arrived on Friday afternoon amidst crazy commute traffic. You pull up in front of the hotel to have the valet take the car and the car behind me wouldn't back up so I could parralel park in front of the hotel. The very nice doorman came out and made the car behind me back up...thanks! The bellman took our bags, check in was a breeze. We got room 717 which overlooks Powell St, which is busy and noisy. The cable car goes by on Powell, so that can be charming or annoying, depends on how you look at it. I think it was charming. It is noisy though! The room was not as clean as I would like it. The decor was nice and updated, but the carpet was a little tired and the 17 kazillion coats of paint on the walls was a bit much. I also noticed a musty smell throughout the hallways, just smelled old and as if the air system needed to be cleaned out bad. We ate dinner Friday night at Plouf, a French restaurant about 10-15 minute walk away and had awesome mussels, mine was in coconut broth, with a little spice. It was dee-lish! We had lunch on Saturday at Kuleto's, the restaurant in the hotel. Yummy Italian food. The bread they bring before your meal is very yummy. My risotto was a little too al dente, and too much salt, but still yummy. I was surprised at the $40 charge for the car valet. That seemeed steep, but that's life in the big city. The hotel is the best location for shopping!"
97,2202,"Apr 15 2009 	Lacked a warm welcome	We arrived at the hotel a little after 10:00 in the evening. Parking is valet and no one was available to help with the bags or take care of the cars that jammed the entrance. I squeezed in the car to park and we took care of our own bags and checked into the room. First impressions were not good... However, the location is great for shopping in Union Square. I also liked theStarbucks on the corner and the convenience store a half block away. Cable car is right out front. The bathroom had an institutionalized feel with the walk in shower and stark pedestal sink - no where to put make-up, hair dryer, etc. when getting ready. The shower was more than adequate with good water pressure. On the second and third night the valet parking situation did improve and personnel were very accomodating. The room is small and does have a slight smell which I just associate with old buildings. Overall, I would stay here again due to the location."
98,2202,"Apr 3 2009 	Patient Reception Staff	Firstly, Villa Florence is in a great location just south of Union Square. Unfortunately, our rooms weren't ready when we checked in at 1600 (although reception didn't know this, we found out when we entered our rooms). This was quickly sorted out to be fair.Unfortunately, my room didn't have a safe so I changed the following day. My new room didn't have any wireless signal so I switched again to a room where all was well.The small bar was fine however I wasn't too impressed with the onsite restaurant. The food wasn't that good and was quite pricey.There is no room service at this hotel and the only information you get about the place is a piece of A4 with little information - no typical pack detailing the services they provide.It was a pleasant stay, don't get me wrong, but with a little extra work it could be a great place given the price of the rooms."
99,2202,"Mar 24 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Stay	Me and my husband stayed at this hotel for 2 nights to get away for a little while. The hotel is nice and in the middle of everything. It is in Union Square. Very busy area but just minutes from the mall, stores, restaurants, China Town and the cable cars. The hotel employees were very nice. The rooms were nice considering the historic building. The only down fall was the parking. It was 40.00 a night for valet. We parked our car at the O'Farrel parking garage just a block down from the hotel for 30.00 a night which saved us about $20.00. We will be going back!"
100,2202,"Mar 11 2009 	Fabulous Hotel 	My husband and I stayed at Villa Florence many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed our visit so we decided to stay there again this past January 29-31, 2009. We were very pleased with the lovely renovated rooms and found the entire staff from the Doorman, Concierge, Reception and Housekeeping to be most efficient, accommodating and considerate. I knew our stay would be delightful as I received a personalized confirmation within minutes of placing my on-line reservation directly with the hotel assuring me that the quiet room on higher floor that I had requested had been reserved. Upon arrival, after a 6 hour delayed flight from the East Coast, Lea, the Receptionist, warmly greeted us and unexpectedly upgraded us to a junior suite. Needless to say, we were ecstatic . We were also starving, however as it was Friday evening, Kuleto's Italian Restaurant which is accessed from inside Villa Florence was completely booked. While it didn't seem possible we could be seated, Lea, the Receptionist immediately offered to personally speak with Kuletos reservation manger. Within minutes Lea had magically secured a dinner reservation for half an hour later and the dining experience was memorable, so memorable in fact that the next morning we had breakfast and another great dinner the following evening. Our spacious, two room, Tuscan inspired junior suite was beautiful and immaculate. Soothing shades of umber, brown, turquoise with luxurious upholstery, drapes and bedding with beautiful Burl wood furniture. The entire bathroom was remodeled with a large sink vanity and completely tiled in beige marble with glass tile accents, bathrobe, hair dryer and LOccitane bath products and thick white towels . There was a great little coffee maker with Starbucks coffee pods and a complimentary bottle of water. The flat screen TV with a wall bracket could be viewed from both the sitting area and bed. Also there was a DVD player and a docking station. Oh, did I mention how wonderful the bed was? Egyptian sheets, a down duvet cover, multiple pillows (down, foam non-allergic etc). The Housekeeping staff were so considerate and polite. Each day, the housekeeper assigned to our room left us a note thanking us for the gratuity we left each day. We haven't seen that in many years. Also, if you are arriving at SFO and require transportation to and from the hotel, make arrangements in advance with the Concierge as they have an arrangement with a private shuttle service that is less than the airport shuttle services and the only stop they make is to Villa Florence. What more can I say except that it was a fabulous weekend!"
101,2202,"Feb 25 2009 	Great hotel in the heart of Union Square	Got great deal for this King room on Orbitz. Staff was very nice when we checked in. I had requested an exterior corner room and that is what we got. There was some street noise but not enough to bother us. The room was decent size and clean. The whole hotel had a weird smell. Not sure if it was just from the age or what....could not figure it out. Bathroom was very small and had no counter space, only frees tanding sink. Stand up shower was good size. We were right on the cable car line which was great about getting around town. Bed had feather bed top and was very comfy. Free internet was a plus. I would definitely stay here again."
102,2202,"Jan 28 2009 	wonderful surprise especially for the price	Booked a Sunday night in Villa Florence for an interview the next morning thinking it'd be just a simple place to stay for a night, but I was pleasantly surprised to pull up at a beautifully remodeled hotel right in the middle of the city downtown Union Square shopping! Valet (yes, a steep $40/night for unlimited in/out) was courteous and patient as I unloaded everything from my car from grocery bags to little odds and ends (I thought it would be self-park). At the check-in, they were asked whether I wanted street- or quiet-side room -- I decided to go with top-floor street-side room for more light and the noise actually didn't end up bothering me too much (though I would advise earplugs for most).The hallways remind you of the history of the building with the maze of hallways and creaky floors, but the room was impeccably remodeled, especially the bathroom with gleaming white tiles and fixtures. The feather-top bed was divine, and with a large flat-screen TV, free wireless, a clock-radio with iPod docking station, ironing board, bath robes, l'Occitane bath soaps, there was little more I could ask for. Great stay, and great deal!"
103,2202,"Jan 26 2009 	Not for me	I stayed at the Villa Florence for two nights while in San Francisco for business. The lobby was nice and so were the front desk people although for some reason I got a little attitude from the valet. I arrived in my &quot;travel clothes&quot;; jeans and a hoody and felt terribly under dressed. There is NO parking. You have to use the valet service which is $40/night plus parking tax. My room was on the second floor which was WAY too close to street level for someone like me who is not entirely accustomed to city noise which lasts all night. The room was comfortable, but small. The DVD player did not work. I openned my minibar fridge and was overwhelmed by a horrible odor. There was some sort of black moldy food left in there. When I called the front desk they promptly moved me to a new room and thoroughly appologized. The DVD player did not work in this room either so they let me order one of the pay movies for free. Overall the hotel was nice, but stay on a higher floor. It was SO loud! Oh and Thursday mornings are trash day..."
104,2202,"Dec 20 2008 	Lovely Hotel Great Location	My mom and I were looking for a nice little hotel near Union Square for a holiday shopping trip. I booked the Villa Florence through the hotel's website with great ease. I was contacted twice via email before our arrival, confirming our stay as well as letting us know a little bit about the hotel and what to expect in our room. Upon arrival, our bags were loaded and check in was a breeze. The bell man brought our bags up, unloaded them, showed us all amenities in our room and could not have been more friendly. Our room, a junior suite, was charming. Nicely appointed furnishings, comfortable beds (even a sofa sleeper), newly updated bathroom with L'Occitane products. The location is superb for shopping, being 1/2 block from Union Square and 3 blocks to the San Francisco Centre. Being located on Powell, there is a bit of street noise that filters in. Just ask for an interior room and you'll be fine. We were very pleased with our stay, for the price and location it was well worth it."
105,2202,"Dec 5 2008 	Elegant and well-located	Villa Florence is an elegant, European-style, recently renovated boutique hotel. There is a significant variety of rooms, so it is important you contact the hotel directly (even after you have booked using Expedia or another tool) to make sure the room matches your needs. I got a great room in the back of the building (see picture) since I wanted a very quiet place and did not care much for the view. The breakfast is excellent, but if you are rushed or an early riser, it is better to go to the nearby Starbucks (the restaurant of the hotel opens only at 7am and only takes a-la-carte orders, i.e. there is no buffet). Last but not least, the location is very convenient: the hotel is nearby Union Square and only 5min away from the BART."
106,2202,"Dec 1 2008 	Superb location	I have stayed at the Villa Florence twice now with about a ten year gap between my stays. The location cannot be beat. The nice thing is you can book an inside room so you can actually sleep away from the hustle and bustle of Powell Street, and yet you can step outside of the lobby right next to a lively corner of Union Square. Check in was quick and efficient; we were able to get into our room at 11:15. We had a junior suite which was spacious. The bathrooms aren't that large, but it is an older building. The amenities were all updated. There was a nicely stocked mini bar. The bath products were nice, and there was great water pressure in the shower. The room was clean and reminiscent of an Italian villa. The lobby had nice seating areas. Besides having Kuleto's, a full restaurant, there is Bar Norcini which serves wine, panini, pastries, and coffee. Check out was also smooth. The only delay we had was the retrieval of our car from valet parking because the lot is offsite. I will definitely be back to the Villa Florence."
107,2202,"Nov 11 2008 	A Great Place	We just stayed at The Villa Florence this last weekend with friends for a birthday get away and had a great time. The Hotel Staff are very accomodating, the rooms are very nice, and of course the Hotel's location is right at the hustle and bustle of Union Square - We will be back"
108,2202,"Nov 10 2008 	What a Jewel in the Middle of SF	I stayed in Villa Florence for two nights. I have been to SF numerous times and have stayed at all the big name hotels, but none of them come close to Villa Florence. The room was clean and spacious. There was 40inch+ flar screen in the room, an iHome for my iPod, and a DVD player. This hotel is on Powel Street where the cable cars run, but my room was on the inside and I didn't hea a thing. When I arrived, there were complimentary treats in my room with a welcome note. That was a real classy touch. There is also a great restaurant in the lobby called Kuletos. walking distance to public transportation, union square, and SF shopping center. I can't wait to go back!"
109,2202,"Oct 14 2008 	Lovely hotel in an awesome location	-great location-stayed in a nice sized room; room730 inside room, spacious, very quiet...recommenedLocation: steps to the Powell/Mkt Cable Car turnaround, and right around the corner from beautiful Union Square. Shopping is right there...don't think there's a betterRecommend an inside room, much more quieter.Bar Norcini and Kutelo's restaurant are right in the lobby..very convenient.Service: front desk is extremely helpful and calls you by name...give them top marks for their friendliness and making us always feel very welcome and part of their hotel family."
110,2202,"Sep 28 2008 	Villa Florence was great!	My husband and I just returned from a short getaway trip to San Francisco. I booked our stay through Expedia and chose Villa Florence for its location and its pet policy (no added fee!), since our Jack Russell terrier accompanied us on our trip. The hotel let us check into our room early (check-in is at 3 pm), even though I only called them 30 minutes before we arrived. They also honored my request for a quiet, pet-friendly room at the last minute when I wrongfully assumed that Expedia would pass on our special requests. We were warmly welcomed by the staff, and our anxious dog, who is not exactly a city dog and was overwhelmed with all the hustle and bustle, was met with smiles and welcome petting. (Every time we went in and out of the hotel, we, including our dog, were greeted warmly by the staff.) Our standard king room was not exactly gigantic, but large enough for us and was well-decorated and clean. The bathroom is small but quite functional and had great products from Lather. My husband was happy to see the large flat screen tv and the ipod ready sound system in the room. The linens on the bed were soft and the feather bed quite comfortable. The room itself was an interior room with no view, which was good for us since it got quite noisy at night from the busy streets below. On Friday night, we heard the faint thumping bass from a nearby club but not so loud that we couldn't sleep. We had breakfast at the attached restaurant, Kuleto's, on our final day, and it was reasonably priced (compared to everything else in San Francisco) and very tasty. The cable cars run right in front of the hotel on Powell Street and the Bart/Muni station is just 2 blocks down, so transportation was no problem at all. The only negative I would say about our stay was the lack of nearby parks to take our dog. Union Square, even with its grassy area, wasn't exactly an ideal place for our dog. Overall, I would recommend Villa Florence for its friendly service, clean and comfortable accomodations and its proximity to everything. We had a great time!"
111,2202,"Aug 20 2008 	Loved Loved Loved IT!!!!	We loved our time in San Francisco and a huge part of it was staying at the Villa Florence Hotel!! From Cora who booked our room all the way down to the lady that cleaned our room we were made to feel they were happy to have us staying with them. Every time we were in the lobby someone greeted us and made sure we were well taken care of. Our room was beautiful - it was on the 5th floor and was a inside corner room (highly recommend), very spacious - the bedding was luxurious. We loved the location, ammenities, and especially the staff!!!"
112,2202,"Aug 20 2008 	Remodeling falling sadly short	My wife and I spent a week at the Villa Florence at the beginning of June. The remodeling work in the lobby was just being finished at that time and the room we were in was finished. The reservation clerk made a particular effort to see that we received a quiet inside room and that was much appreciated.The rennovations, while attractive, fell short of the standard to which the hotel aspires. The room had a sitting area, but that separate space had no light or phone. The door to the bathroom was cheap and thin, so if you used the facility at night, you woke your partner. The very pretty mirror and pedistal sink in the bathroom offered only a very thin shelf for your items, and it was mostly taken over with two drinking glasses. There was no low-level light in the bathroom for night use, so your only options were to stumble or be fully awakened by the bright sink light. The front door could use more of a real doorman, as well. For such a busy location, the hotel needs to make more of a point of having door staff which can look out for guests and the hotel.So, it's an attractive place with a great location and clean attractive rooms, but the new owners (Larkspur) are taking too many shortcuts on the quality and it's risking undermining the quality of the hotel. Reserve with caution."
113,2202,"Jul 21 2008 	Great hotel	We stayed at the Villa Florence for 3 nights on our honeymoon on July 13-16.The hotel is in a great location, close to many shops and restaurants, and the cable car stops pretty much outside the door, unless you feel like walking a few meters, then you can go down to the turn around and catch the cable car from there...the lines are long there though.Staff is very friendly and helpful. As stated we stayed at the hotel on our honeymoon, and when we returned to the hotel the first night we had recieved a bottle of wine from the hotel. A very lovely gesture.We make it a habit to tip houskeeping every day to ensure the person who cleans our room that day gets her share of the tip, apparantley we had the same lady clean our room every day, and every day when we came back to the hotel she had left us a little note thanking us for being so kind to her and wishing us a great day etc, a very nice touch we felt.Our room was large, as was the bathroom. My husband was very happy about the free wi-fi connection in the room.We would absolutely stay here again."
114,2202,"Jul 14 2008 	Great Stay at Villa Florence	My husband &amp; I wanted a quick get away from the Sacramento summer heat and smoke. I booked thru Hotels.com after narrowing my search to 10 hotels near Union Square. The hotel is almost done w/ a season long remodel job. It was a pleasant surprise immediately. The staff was accomodating, helpful and extremely polite. Our room was a King-Studio and was spotless and nicely decorated. We were in room #522 which was &quot;inside&quot; and extremely quiet. The location is perfect for downtown shopping, visits to China town, and an enjoyable up &amp; down walk to the wharf. We will recommend this hotel to all friends and family. We ate at the restaurant connected to hotel, Kulettos, and had an exquisitely tasty lunch! We walked just around the corner to the landmark Lefty O'Douls for breakfast. What an affordable treat! And one more thing. . . .the bedding was super comfortable too! I think it was a feather top mattress and ensured a great night's sleep. We will be back for the Christmas holidays!"
115,2202,"Jul 2 2008 	A Gem If You Book the Right Room	Pros: Great location- 1/2 block from Union Square. Pet-friendly(limited to 2nd floor rooms). Very accommodating and knowledgeable staff. By the second day they were greeting us by name. Free wi-fi access. Excellent rates. Very comfortable beds. Very clean. Marvelous in-house restaurant(Kuletos) open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a delightful bar/restaurant in the lobby where you can eat delicious home-made panini sandwiches,salads, great salami and cheeses. Cons: You have to book the right room or you won't be able to sleep without earplugs. Our room faced O'Farrell, across the street from a bar, and the nighttime noise was deafening until 3am.Other rooms face Powell, and again the cable car noise is annoying. The website says the windows are sound-proof. Ours was definitely not. Our room, a standard Queen, was tiny. It felt like 150 sq. feet. There was no chair to read in and the bed took up most of the room. They offered to move us, but we just didn't want to bother with repacking &amp; unpacking. Summary: This is one hotel where I would definitely advise booking directly by phone with the front desk to make sure you get a room (ie not facing Powell or O'Farrell) that is noise-free, and that is a decent size (the ones with sitting areas are nice). They also have good package deals which include parking ($40 a night otherwise) and a continental breakfast."
116,2202,Jun 17 2008 	Had a great time	My husband and I stayed there in March. It is in the heart of Union Square so there was plenty to do and see. The hotel was under construction when we were there but it never interfered with our stay. The hotel had a complimentary happy hour every day which was nice and the restaurant in the hotel was fabulous. The room was nice but the bathroom was small so as long as you are taking turns in the bathroom you will be fine. With soo much to do in San Fran we spent very little time in our room. I would recommend it to anyone. I hope you enjoy!!
117,2202,"Jun 14 2008 	Can't beat the location	Stayed here from June 5th to June 8th. Had this booked for the second half of our week long stay in San Francisco. This was the best value for the money choice from what we can see on the internet. (week of the Diabetes convention)Observations:The hotel is underconstruction, the front door/lobby area. As well as the back section of the first floor facing the elevators. Villa Florence is an older hotel, and is very apparent from the interior of the building, rooms, hallways, and the faint musky smell that seems to linger in the air. Somewhat like the smell of a vintage clothing store. The room we had was cozy, bathroom alittle small. The positives:From checkin to daily greetings, and check out, the staff is both friendly and helpful. We were on the 5th floor, and cannot hear any construction noise. There's complimentary coffee in the mornings and wine at 5pm. The beds are extremely comfortable and rooms are clean. Best of all, you can't beat the location. Right in Union square, across from Macy's, and just blocks away to the cable car, light rail line, shopping, China Town, restaurants etc. Would definitely consider staying here again for the convenience and value."
118,2202,"Jun 4 2008 	loved this hotel	It's not often I would take the time to write a hotel review but our experience in San Fransisco was so memorable that I am making an exception. I booked a family room for the 4 of us (two young teenagers) and we expected to be squashed as I had read all the other reviews about the room size being small, but seeing as though it was only for 4 nights and the price was good I thought we'd take a chance. We arrived from Vegas very late at night and were delighted that not only had our room been held for us (as requested ) but that we were upgraded to a family suite. The room we found to be delightful, (no view but who cares when you are out all day),quiet, clean &amp; bright.The kingsized bed and sofa-bed was more than adequate, though if my children had been any older I don't think we could have managed. The bathroom was a bit small, but I am being picky. The reception staff were more than helpful &amp; wine tasting at 5pm a real bonus. We didn't try the 'in-house' restaurant as, after 3 weeks in the States, we found it a bit pricey but there are plenty of other restaurants in the vacinity to suit your budget. The location is superb, out of the door and on to Union square, right on the cable car line. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone."
119,2202,"May 28 2008 	Not remodeled yet	Their website lets you believe that the hotel has finished being remodeled, this is not the case. The entire front area and lobby is under construction with scaffolding everywhere. The rooms we decent and clean but I could not tell if they were remodeled either as the carpet looked a little old. The room was actually a descent size and it had very comfy beds. My only complaint about it was that we had a room facing Powell St and it was really noisy. Luckily, we are pretty heavy sleepers but I could imagine that the noise could keep someone up at night. You hear everything going on, on the street including cable cars, people talking and traffic. I think the hotel has some good potential once it is completely finished. We didnt eat at the restaurant there but it was always busy and the food looked good. Before we went out at night we started off at the bar at Kuletto's for a glass of wine or a martini. The bar tender there was really friendly and gave us some good recommendations on places to eat. I would stay here again since the price was good for the area but will wait until they are finished with construction."
120,2202,"Apr 22 2008	Under Construction	This hotel is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Contrary to the management's insistence, this fact is NOT made clear on the website (which says that the hotel is open during it's &quot;transformation&quot;). The entire front of the building is covered in scaffolding, and the lobby is a construction zone. Otherwise, the service was fine, but our closet door was completely broken and the heating unit did not work. If you want to be in the middle of Union Square, it's a good location. But I would not reccommend this hotel, because it is dishonest not to dsiclose to customers that the place is under construction, and you can book a room for the same price or better in a comporable hotel (NOT under construction) nearby."
121,2202,"Mar 26 2008 	Restaurant is the Only Star	Its truly a shame that the renovations do not appear to be making the most of the potentials here--a wonderful restaurant and a prime location. Villa Florence is one block off Union Square, and from the street the hotel looks elegant. However, once inside, we discovered that the charming Italian style Caffe Kuleto was closed for renovations! We also discovered that half the lobby was boarded off for renovations as wellwhich meant that those who did brave the evening wine reception were crowded around the reception desk. We were not told that hotel was going through a renovation upon booking nor is it explained anywhere on the hotel website. To make up for the inconvenience, we were given a discount coupon for a future(?) reservation which we will decline.The service at the Villa Florence was poor to nonexistent. We had to wait about 10 minutes to check in with only one clerk at the reception desk. One day we needed change for the trolley, but gave up after 5 minutes of waiting. The concierge was adequate if he felt like being helpful  at other times we were brushed off with curt responses. The short-cut keys on the phones in the rooms didnt work. After receiving constant busy signals, I learned just to use my cell phone. (This occurred in the updated room as well.) The honor bar takes up most of the fridge, with room left for only a couple bottles of water. We had booked a king suite, which was worn and small. We could feel soft spots under the carpet like the subfloor was rotted. The tub was moldy, the door to the bathroom had a hole in it, and the bathroom wall was scribbled with what appeared to be crayon. The furniture was in good condition. The walls in the room were paper thin. We heard every word as the couple in the next room got ready for dinner. We did have a door that adjoined to that other room, so maybe the other rooms arent as bad.After our first night, I asked about moving to a renovated room. The staff person I spoke with was very pleasant and agreed to move us to an updated room on the 7th floor. It should be noted that only the bathrooms are being renovated, which is greatly needed, but the stale, stained carpet was not replaced. The bathroom renovation was also a half attempt, with a hair dryer that had only &quot;off&quot; or &quot;low&quot; settings, hardware that was not attached firmly to the wall, harsh lighting, and a pedestal sink with no room for personal items. The updated room was located in a quiet corner of the hotel so we got a much needed restful sleep with no noise from the neighbors. Our last night there, we ate at Kuletos restaurant, and I cannot say enough good things about that experience. The service was excellent. Eric, our waiter, was informative, patient, and professional. The food was out of this worldthe best meals weve both had in quite some time."
122,2202,Mar 4 2008	great location small rooms	Great location. 1 minute walk to Cable Car ticketing booth. 2 minutes to apple store;-). Safe to walk at night as it's in an area with lots of tourists and locals. The rooms are old and small. It was recently re-painted but the bathroom door couldn't close completely because the paint was too thick. I had a room facing Powell where the cable cars ran. It was very noisy! Ding ding ding and the cable cars rolling on the track sounds lasted till after midnight.I parked my rental car at Ellis Ofarrell carpark nearby and walk to the hotel. I probably will stay here again if I cannot find another hotel at this price. This will be my backup hotel.
123,2202,"Mar 3 2008 	Poor hotel - there are much better around	Here are the list of problems with this hotel:- Tiny rooms (they obviously divided their existing rooms in half)- Power points in very inconvenient locations- Water takes up to 2 minutes to heat up to be warm/hot- Certain taps do not work at all- No clocks in rooms (i.e. no alarm clock)For the location, and the price, there are much better hotels around Union Square. I will never stay here again."
124,2202,"Feb 23 2008 	Hated the small room!	We stayed two nights at this hotel and were thoroughly underwhelmed. The front desk staff were unhelpfull and we had to lug all our bags into the lobby and up to the room with no offer of assistance etc. The room was supposed to be a twin and/or double for the two of us. I actually went back to the reception after checking the room because I believed they had incorrectly given us a single room. Front desk assured me the room was a double and that nothing could be done as the hotel was fully booked! The bed was at best a 3/4 single, the TV didn't work, and there was not enough space in the room with our our 2 suitcases, 1 ski bag and a boot bag to open the door let alone relax and unwind.Construction was going on on the floor above us and the noise was constant. There was also a very offensive smell of burnt rubber throughout the corridors.We will never stay in this place again and would advise others against doing so as well."
125,2202,"Feb 5 2008 	Cozy spot to settle in near Union Square	I was looking for an inexpensive hotel while on business, to stay overnight so I wouldn't have to drive the 1+ hour each way back and forth between two days at a conference near Union Square. My corporate travel came up with this hotel and frankly based on the rate I was a little worried. But the experience was entirely positive and my worries were unfounded. Also I saw they have AARP and AAA rates that equaled my low corporate rate. At just over $100 a night in down-town SF!!! This is a great deal!Front desk service was fine. I checked in and out and checked my bag twice with no issue. The property was well maintained and clean. It is an older property so the elevators are smaller and the rooms have high ceilings and are clearly older, but with charm and no problems. It reminded very much of a room my wife and I stayed in, in the SF St. Francis (Westin property) old part of the hotel, which is 1/2 block away and a well known property for two or three times the rate. The windows looked into a breezeway, so there was no view but it was quiet and light.The room was a very good size for a queen bed, had a desk, and the bathroom was small but fine. There was even an umbrella in the closet along with the iron and ironing board. The hotel wireless internet worked fine and I think it came included with the room.When you're in SF you should be out doing things and this is a great hotel if you are doing just that and want something comfortable and cozy to come home to at the end of the day."
126,2202,"Feb 4 2008 	Not A Great Stay...	This was my third stay at the Villa Florence in the past year and I will not stay at this hotel again. My reservation room request was not honored even though I confirmed with the hotel several days before arrival. The gentleman handling check-in on Friday night was extremely rude and didn't care that the 2 bed room I requested was unavailable. He blamed the error on the fact that they were overbooked and under going renovations. He also offered no solution. There was no manager on duty, but he assured me the manager would contact me the next day. The manager was never around all weekend.The room looked old and had peeling wallpaper. The water did not get hot and the phone did not work. The bed was very comfortable and the room did look clean. The location is amazing! It is in Union Square and in easy walking distance to all shopping and Chinatown. It is 2 blocks away from the Powell Street BART station, which easily connects you to the rest of SF, the Bay Area, and SFO Airport.With regard to the construction, it is not mentioned on their website and it is very disruptive. Extremely loud construction was taking place on 3 floors at such hours as 10pm on Friday evening and 9am on Sunday morning. I contacted the front desk about the loud noises and they promised to talk to the construction workers, but it didn't stop.I would recommend avoiding this hotel until at least after construction is finished (Summer 2008)!"
127,2202,"Jan 21 2008 	Excellent location not so great hotel	The Villa Florence is in an excellent spot in the heart of San Francisco. Basically everything is within walking distance.. Shopping, dining, China Town, etc...The hotel itself was not so great. It appeared clean at first but it was not.. I got sick after sleeping in the bed the first night.. Found the bathroom to be rather dirty. To top it off, it was VERY noisy at night and early morning. Overall, it was a so-so stay. Not the best hotel I've stayed in."
128,2202,Jan 17 2008 	Loved the Villa Florence!	This is a great hotel due to it's terfice location and for the price you cannot beat it.I have stayed in great many hotels in large cities and this is just what anybody who is doing business is looking for.I stay at Villa Florence twice a year for business and it is perfect and for the price an location it cannot be beat.
129,2202,"Jan 13 2008 	Great Price Great Location!	If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel in a terrific location, Villa Florence is the hotel for you while visiting the wonderful city of San Francisco. It's located in Union Square, is on the cable car line, and is only a few blocks from the BART station. We took the BART to Montgomery Station with all our luggage. Villa Florence was only a few blocks up, so it was perfect! The lobby was both beautiful and welcoming. Our room was a king studio. It was spacious for a city hotel, and the bathroom was recently renovated. Everything was clean and looked nice. Our window faced the main street with the cable car line, and we did not find it overly noisy. The location was phenomenal! We were within walking distance to great shopping, awesome restaurants, and neat nightlife. The cable car station was one block away from the hotel. If it's a nice day, you could wait in line to watch the spinning of the cars. If not, here's a trick - go up a few blocks from the hotel and wait on the corner. The street cars do not fill up at the station area so that they can pick up other riders up the line. This can save you quite a bit of time - I believe we waited over 45 minutes to board. The hotel offers complimentary coffee and tea each morning. Even better, they have a small bakery/cafe, Cafe Kuleto's, that is attached to their lobby. It was fabulous and well-priced. You don't even have to leave the hotel! The hotel also has an awesome restaurant, Kuleto's, that offers incredible italian cuisine, but is a bit pricey. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Villa Florence. Out of all the other Union Square hotel options, this one was nearly $100 cheaper per night. It was definitely a hotel we'd stay at again and we will definitely recommend it to our friends and family. For the location, it cannot be beat!"
130,2202,"Dec 29 2007 	Great holiday stay at Villa Florence	Booked a four night stay through Quikbook for a double room ($101). We got to the hotel about 10 a.m. and although we couldn't check in (we dropped off the luggage) we were asked if we preferrred a view (we were warned it would be noisy) or a quiet room (no view) and the room would be held for us. Since I lived for many years near nightclubs I went for the view. The room was small, and overlooked Powell but it was quite comfortable and it was just as noisy (cable car runs on this street) as they had warned, so make sure to ask for a quiet room if that's your preference. Cable television, free wi-fi, small fridge and coffee pot in room. Coffee, tea and danish in the a.m. and wine from 5-6. p.m in their lobby. Parking is $40 plus tax. If you have a car, a garage is just a block away on O'Farrel and rates are about half. The locaiton in Union Square couldn't be better, it's so close to all the major stores (Macy's, Saks, Gap etc), Westfield mall is just a few blocks away. I don't think it took us more than 10 minutes to walk to Chinatown. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I hope to go back again soon and would definitely stay here again."
131,2202,"Dec 4 2007 	Good stay but horrible experience	We stayed here for three nights. Great check-in, very welcoming lobby. Our room, one of the king studio suites, was spacious (for San Francisco) and well appointed.However, the last night we encountered some very menacing Australian hotel guests. They were very loud, smashing glasses, etc. We called the front desk, and they were (at least initially) very slow to respond, and (apparently) had told the Australians that we had complained. After the hotel management called them, the Australians of course came directly to our room to threaten us.We immediately moved to another room, albeit a much smaller, much less well-appointed one, on a lower floor. It was disappointing that the hotel didn't act quicker, and we felt that they handled the situation okay, but not great."
132,2202,"Nov 21 2007 	A Relatively Cheaper Option	We booked this hotel our 3 nites in SF as there was a 20% off for AAA member. The net total turned out to be relatively cheaper than other hotels of the same class and location.Arriving - The hotel lies on the busy Powell St towards O'farrell St. If you arrive by car or taxi or airport shuttle, be sure you come from the Pine St direction from the hill so you can land in front of the hotel. If you turn in via Market St, you would have a hard time to land your ride at a decent place to even unload your luggages. Parking is $40/day so I suggest you use taxi or BART or airport shuttle.Check In - The reception staff were friendly and fast. We got our room key within minutes.Room - The room given to us on 2nd floor was noisy. There was no view at all. All we saw were other windows opposite us, lest mentioned the ugly sight of a dark and dirty back street. The room size was just okay to fit 2 double bed, a TV+DVD player at the corner and a writing table. It was brightly lilted and the decoration was a little elaborated with yellow strip wallpaper. We requested for a room change due to the noise and was obliged the next day. The new room was at 5th floor with a more spacious layout and of course, quiet.Check Out - The process is again a breeze.Conclusion - If you need a clean room to rest and sleep with a good location to roam around till late nite, this is the place to pick."
133,2202,"Nov 4 2007 	Location location location	Villa Florence is in a great location, right on union square and the trolley line. I had a great room on the front of the building and I was able to hear the trolley bell in my room. If you are a light sleeper or looking for some peace and quiet do not stay in the front of the building. The staff was helpful and very pleasant. The rooms are cozy and well-equipped. I would definitely stay here again."
134,2202,"Oct 29 2007 	NOT a good experience	The location of this hotel is fantastic, and the lobby is beautiful and lively. The rooms, however, I found to be really dissapointing. The first room I checked into, 212, I think, was tiny and very dirty. The floorboards looked like they had water damage - they were moldy and peeling. The bed linens looked really old and shabby, the shower head in the shower was at my collar bone - I am 5'6&quot; - I had to bend down to shower. It was also EXTREMELY loud. I requested a room change, which I got the next day, and this room was much quieter, but still felt dingy and unclean. This room was even smaller (this was room 316) and had only a shower, no tub. The shower was really really small. I weigh 130 and I could barely turn around in it without toughing a (plastic) wall. The door didnt close properly, either. The worst part of this room was that it smelled really really bad. It was really offensive every time I entered the room, and I felt generally grossed out. The staff was OKAY - they didnt seem to care that I wasnt happy with my stay, and I was there three nights; but they werent outright rude by any means....not really that helpful though. good luck!"
135,2202,"Oct 18 2007 	Villa Florence - very good	I stayed in the Villa Florence for 4 nights in Oct 2007. My room was 422. The rate was $150 per night. I had an excellent room, quiet and comfortable. The room was clean and quite spacious - the hotel termed it as a junior suite. It had a sofa and a king size bed.Overall I was impressed with the Villa Florence. It's close to Union Square and the cable car, so right in the heart of things. The rate was much less than many hotels that aren't as good, and the service was very good. Both the restaurant and coffee shop in the hotel were always busy, and used by locals, so a sure sign they are good.Very impressed."
136,2202,"Oct 17 2007	Great location good shopping	I had a lot of problems finding a hotel in SF, and a lot of problems with hotels.com, so I was somewhat nervous when we got to Villa Florence. We had booked a kingsize bed, and while they said it was a kingsize room, the bed wasn't. We didn't complain it was good enough for us. Small, bathroom, rather noisy airco, but decent size room, good facilities. Good bed, pillows and comforter. Great location!Our room faced a larger ventilation shaft aka court side view. But thats not an issue for us. In some of the reviews pointed out the noise on the street. The Irish pub is gone and they are doing renovation. We never had any problems getting around using public transport the hotel was very very good located for that, and shopping. Chinatown is just a few blocks away, and its much nicer and more interesting then new york's chinatown. Though not as much fake brand name bags .. if that's what you are after. There are a lot of restaurants around, most of them variations of stake house in different levels of sophistication. Which doesn't appeal to us. So we where some what disappointed in that."
137,2202,"Oct 12 2007 	wonderful stay	we had a great time and a great stay at the Villa florence. from the time we checked in with Cora to the time we left saying goodby to Clarence the Concierge who really gave us great recommendation, it was by those recommendations that we found ourselves having a great time in SF. the rooms at the Villa Florence are very cozy, and clean, at check in we were ask if we wanted a quiet room or a room facing the street, this area is very busy and often nosiy, we choose a room facing the street, living in NOLA the noise was not a problem for us, every night one of the street musician would play Sun Rise Sun Set, this was heard throughtout our room, how romantic!!!! if you are a person that like peace and quiet please do not get a room facing the street. this was our first vist to SF, and what an experience. the hotels location is great, right in Union Square, within walking distance to great shopping, wonderful resturants and plenty of good coffee stops. the cable car runs in front of the hotel, and the ticket booth to ride the cable car is located only 2 blocks away on market and powell, you really would want to purchase a pass, the pass would allow you to hop on and off other wise it would cost you $5.00 everytime you get on, this car will take you to the Wharf. at the Wharf we took a Trolley Tour which was a great way to see SF. we went to the City of Sausalito by way of ferry, the ferry ride and city was wonderful. hats off to VF and Clarence for a wonderful stay and great trip"
138,2202,"Oct 6 2007 	Satisfied would go back again	From London, UKDate. 20-26 Sept. 2007The first impression as you get in, is very good. Nice lobby and a very friendly reception staff. However, the building is very old.They gave us room No.620. The corridors had a bad smell, like urinated by pets. The room had similar smell, and was very humid. There were some stains on the carpet and the armchair. The room was not cleaned properly, and had dust. Some of the food in the mini bar was expired. We asked for a different room straight away. The staff was very willing to help us and they agreed to give us another room without saying anything. However we had to stay in that room for the first night, since no other room was available at that time. Next day we moved to 511. That was much better, cleaner with no stains or odours. It was smaller but that wasnt a problem. Overall, the hotel was very convenient as it is located in the heart of San Francisco. You can go everywhere from there. However, there are many homeless around who are harmless, but might make you feel uncomfortable. For tourists, this hotel is a very good option. If you are in your honeymoon, try to avoid, and go for something more expensive and luxurious.Yes, I would strongly recommend it, and yes I would go back again."
139,2202,"Oct 2 2007 	Excellent location charming hotel	My friend had a reservation for the Villa Florence during her convention in SF, and I tagged along. After reading other reviews here, I recommended she request a room to the rear of the building. We had a small, quiet and clean room on the 5th floor with two beds. The bedding was comfy--duvet with over and under sheets (love that!). The bathroom was tiny but serviceable. The staff were friendly and helpful--no complaints. Loved the wine tasting in the afternoon--sampled some nice Beringers. Lived for the free coffee in the mornings!Best reason to stay at the VF is its location. Right on the cable car line, a block to the BART/Muni stops. In the heart of shopping, with great bars and restaurants scattered around. Easy walking distance to Chinatown (gotta love those steep SF hills!)Overall, the VF is a great hotel in a fabulous city. I would definitely stay here again!"
140,2202,"Sep 18 2007 	Great Experience! Please read!	The Villa Florence is a great hotel. It is an excellent location, accomodating staff, great restaurant and bar, fantastic atmosphere, very busy with lots of traffic in and out of the lobby - we LOVED it! I travel regularly for business and pleasure. I usually choose 3 start hotels or above. I read the negative reviews for this hotel when researching where to stay in San Francisco and I know everyone can have different experiences, but if you pay $200 for a hotel room - don't expect $500 service and accomodations. People also shoudn't 'ding' the hotel for a one-time error...these things happen. I think this hotel was well worth every penny we spent! We had a blast! The ONLY thing I can consider as a 'negative' would be the 'noise level' of Powell Street. It didn't bother us one bit, but if you don't like noise or are a light sleeper - then you may consider requeseting another room. I think the view is totally worth the noise which is: hearing the dinging of the trolley bells and the cars as they run down the tracks. You can also hear the bustle of the streets with cars, people talking, music, etc. We kept the window open all night! I truly enjoyed our stay - I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to pay in this price range."
141,2202,"Sep 14 2007 	Hallways are like running a maze	The staff is INCREDIBLE! I can't say enough about the staff at the hotel. The room was fine. My biggest complaint in San Francisco is waterFlow in the showers. This hotel had amazing water-flow. I almost got flooded out of the shower. It has a great location if you do plan on nothing but shop. Other than that, it's right on the cable car line. So remember this.....ding ding ding went the trolley. You hear it until they stop running the cablecars."
142,2202,"Sep 4 2007 	A wonderful place	Sept. 04, 2007We are just returning from our San Franciso trip. During planning this trip we did not know where we were going to stay. We had four hotels to chose from and had never stayed at a boutique hotel. We are so glad we did and it being the Villa Florence. This is a wonderful hotel in an awesome location. The hotel accommodated our every needs. We requested a quit room and got it, which you may want due to the busy, nosey and excited streets. The concierge was wonderful, he attended to all our tour needs with no hassles. The hotel wine tasting between 5-6pm is a wonderful touch along with the attached restaurant Kuleto's, (great food). You are literally right at Union Square and in walking distance to public transportation to get all over S.F., no car is needed if you only want to see S.F., parking is expensive. Don't worry about the small rooms, you're only sleeping in them for a short period of time, but the beds were very comfortable. We will definitely make this our first chose upon our return to S.F. Great job Villa Florence, Signed: T. &amp; D. C."
143,2202,"Aug 25 2007 	Cheers for the Villa Florencel	My teen daughter and I just returned from our 7th annual girl trip to SF. We always do extensive tripadvisor hotel research and have tried different boutique hotels. We decided to return to the Villa Florence for the 2nd time for 4 nights and are very glad we did. The staff is extremely pleasant and accommodating, particularly Johames, who's awesome. We arrived fairly early in the am and were able to leave our bags until later so we could go out exploring. The room we had asked for was ready later and we were very pleased. It was quite large, a corner room high up above Powell St. The double beds were VERY comfortable with soft, comfy linens and lots of pillows, which is important to me. It was actually hard to get out of bed in the mornings! We love listening to the cable cars but didn't notice any particularly obnoxious outside noises. The toiletries were nice, the bathroom was well laid out, the room temperature was good and we left the windows open at night for the cool night air. As with most boutique hotels, there is a slight musty sensation in the air but a quick shot of Febreze took care of that. Housekeeping was very attentive and the room was always very clean. The elevator worked well, the hotel was very beautifully decorated and it was nice to come in at the end of the day and see the restaurant busy and the lobby filled with guests enjoying themselves. The hotel is right on Powell near Union Square, easy access to the cable cars and muni buses, as well as the BART station. Special notes - if you walk east across Union Square towards Market to Maiden Lane, you might be lucky enough to catch the opera singers in the lane on Saturdays - it's wonderful (please leave a gratuity). One more thing - if you walk around the Transamerica Pyramid, you'll discover a tiny redwood grove (open during business hours). It's fun to bring a little lunch from the sandwich shop around the corner (Specialties) and rest your feet. All in all, we won't bother with hotel research in the future - it's the Villa Florence from now on for us. Can't wait til next time."
144,2202,"Aug 25 2007 	Very disappointed	What a disappointment! My daughter and I were in San Francisco in July and returned a month later to bring her to college. We had eaten at Kulettos, the restaurant in the lobby of Villa Florence. Kulettos is a wonderful restaurant, full of character and has a beautiful European flair. As such, we thought the hotel would be the same, especially after we checked the website. How surprised we were when we returned last week to find smelly, dusty rooms that are in desperate need of updating with horrible furniture and old bathrooms. We had booked two rooms, including a suite and neither were any where near the standards of a 4 star hotel. And the smell!!! We found out the hotel allows pets (which they claim they rarely have visit) but theh rooms and hallway were a combination of cat urine and dust. Because we had so much luggage to move her in for freshman (and we without a car with all rentals cars sold out for the weekend...I swear we checked every rental agency) we had no choice but grin and bear it. Our room was located at the back of the hotel but the tradeoff for having an alley view was that it was relatively quiet. You are in Union Square so expect some noise!We actually picked the hotel for the location and loved that part of it since we had two teenagers with us. Union Square was right across the street and the park had was offering movies al fresco each night, the kids enjoyed the freedom of doing that while we slept! I love the location for teens, especially those who love to shop!As for the hotel staff they were either excellent or horrible, but thankfully most excellent. The concierge, Clarence, was very helpful and so was the Russian man who has the best coffee out at 5am in the hotel lobby (for east coaster and eurpoeans who can time adjust!) There was a female desk clerk who was so confused and difficult to deal with that we gave up. The only good news was that after we delivered our daughter to USF (and unloaded all her bags!) we were free to go to another hotel as we still planned to stay in the city for 3 more nights. They tried to give us a hard time about it and charge us for cancelling the last 3 nights but since we had told them the day we checked in and had given them plenty of notice, they allowed us to leave without a charge."
145,2202,"Aug 12 2007 	Misleading Web Site	This hotel comes with a slick web site promising lux accomandations &amp; top amenities. Don't believe it! This property is in dire need of a overhaul. Rooms are beat with bathrooms dating from the 70s. Heat &amp; air are provided by a motel unit stuck in the window, which, in fact, did not even work in the room they gave us. When we arrived, there was no bell service to help unload our luggage and get it up to the room. After seeing the room, we refused to stay. The manager told us they are remodelling in the fall - not soon enough!"
146,2202,"Jul 31 2007 	Rude Staff	I just finished a week staying at this hotel. The rooms are nice but very, very small but the location is good. This was all over shadowed but the extremely rude staff. Not only do they ignore guest at the reception desk, but when you make a request they will make it obvious how difficult you are being even if only asking for an extra key. Rolling of eyes and grunting were common. I recomed that this be your last choice."
147,2202,"Jul 8 2007 	I'd go back	The hotel was okay. I was in San Fran just for the weekend and I was by myself. The room wasn't noisy, of course I was in the back and had no view. They don't provide Aveda products like they advertise which was a disappointment. Plus housekeeping did wake me up which I did not appreciate.However, the location is wonderful. Right in the heart of Union Square and on the trolley line made everything very convenient. Plus I had a car and trusted the valet/parking service. The hotel staff also gave great directions and were very pleasant.If you are just looking for a place to sleep and keep your stuff while experiencing San Francisco, this is a great hotel."
148,2202,"Jun 21 2007 	luxurious hotel!	Nice hotel well located down town at 10 minutes walking from Chinese disctrict.The road on which it is located has a cable car, nevertheless it is quiet."
149,2202,"Jun 19 2007 	Beautiful!	The Villa Florence Hotel exceeded our expectations. Before booking, I read the reviews here and noted the negatives. I found none of these to be true in our case. The locations was perfect, within walking distance of Union Square by one block, Chinatown by just a few blocks. Next door on one side was a fantastic Italian restaurant, and the other side a very nice coffee bar with excellent pastries. A nice quiet bar is also located right inside the door to the right of the lobby. Two doors down was a great place to get a hot slice of gooey pizza, or a panini, and a Starbucks just on the corner, and a great little &quot;convenience&quot; store right across the street with anything you would need including some great wine. Truly, the location of the hotel could not have been better. The hotel itself was quiet. Our room was on the top floor with 2 double beds and a pullout sofa bed. Very roomy and decorated beautifully and spotless. It was very quiet as it was at the back of the hotel. There is a street car out front, but I never heard it once. the staff was very knowledgeable about the area, and very helpful. We loved this place so much and we will definitely be returning to the same place."
150,2202,"May 15 2007 	Gave Key to My Room to Other Guests and NOISY	After flying in from Boton I was exhauted. Check-in took forever - and for some reason the efforts of two people. They also kept looking up to say sweet things to everyone who walked by - which is very nice, but my check-in took 25 minutes without exageration. One could have greeted and left the other to handle the data entry, but they were some kind of binary system.At around 3 am I was awakened by a rustling outside my door - and then a click in the lock, and then the door opened - and a couple entered my room! I was terrified and so were they. They slammed the door. I went out of the room, half-asleep. They were shaking and went downstairs apologizing profusely. I called the front desk. Ooops - gave my key to a couple. Sorry about that. I would think the hotel would be horrified. No, it was as if I had called to say they forgot to give me complimentary shampoo. For some reason, I was not registered as having checked in the hotel! (After all that....) Then they found some evidence of my being checked in - my credit card. I mumbled something about their changing the key or something and fell back asleep. (Had I been more alert I would have insisted they change the keys.)THEN at 3:30 am I received a telephone call. The front desk called. The man started to talk to me as if it were not in the middle of the night. &quot;Sorry to bother you, but we need to check you in...&quot; YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME! He actually wanted to get all the details. I told him my name and said he had my credit card - the rest could wait until the morning.I was still bleary and shaken in the morning. I got up and went down early even though I really needed more sleep to check in again. You would think that they would offer some compensation - and they did. Free breakfast. Not a free night's stay. Not even a free dinner. Eggs do not make up for that. I said no thank you. I was so tired I was naueated as it was.I was there a week (not my choice - business). Every night after that I cranked the air conditioning up and slept with extra bedding to cover up the sound of the live bands that play at the bar across the street until 1 am or so. Lovely little hotel of horrors - not for the squeemish."
151,2202,"Apr 20 2007 	Great Spring Stay	My family of four stayed at the Villa Florence for a couple days during the first week of April. The hotel staff was polite and accommodating. At check in I was asked if we wanted a quiet room. On the cable car route it's always better to get a quiet room. We were given a room with no view but very quiet (if you don't know Union Square, you almost can't have one without the other). The room was not as small as other hotels and well appointed, clean and comfortable. The hallways and rooms were very quiet and it was easy to relax. The hotel itself is in great shape compared to other hotelswe've stayed at in the area and you can't beat the location! I would definitely stay at the Villa Florence again and that's more than I can say for a number of other hotels around Union Square."
152,2202,"Feb 13 2007 	Good location and price but too much street noise	My company booked this room for a trade show at Moscone Center. The location was good, very central to restaurants, BART and the convention center but the street noise made it miserable for sleeping. My room faced an Irish pub across the street, people were yelling, trash cans full of bottles being dumped in the dumpster after closing time all in the wee hours. The homeless situation around here is also quite alarming, they were performing in the street for money, playing drums (on 5 gal pails) and one guy was even blowing a trumpet until 2 am. The police didn't seem to bother them either. The hotel itself is ok for what we paid ~$160 I believe, my bathtub was in tough shape, needed a re-caulk. Also found a ponytail elastic on the back of the door with hair stuck in it. Kinda gross, poor attention to housekeeping detail. The free wireless internet was so slow I could not bear it. I would not stay here again if I could help it."
153,2202,"Jan 30 2007 	Good location	The hotel is in a very convenient location, only a short walk from the BART station and the cable car passes the hotel entrance. On our first night we were given a room overlooking Powell St, but we asked to move because of the noise. We were given an interior room which was very spacious and much quieter. Between 5 and 6pm there is a wine tasting in the hotel bar, and the restaurant is a very popular if upmarket eatery. Union Square is only a small block away."
154,2202,"Oct 16 2006 	Great location but noisy	Just came back from Villa Florence, where I stayed for 6 nights. The hotel is actually quite good, it's well kept, nicely decorated, but the best about it is its location. Few steps to shopping in Union Square, near convention center, 5 min. taxi ride to CalTrain station etc. The only bad thing about it was the noise. As reading few reviews prior I asked for a quiet room in the back. However, there seemed to be a bar in the back of the hotel as well and it meant loud music and yelling etc. every night until 2 am."
155,2202,Oct 16 2006 	OK but dated	This hotel was ok but a bit dated. The first room I stayed in was at the front of the hotel and very noisy (from the street) and I requested to be moved and the front desk staff was very pleasant and moved me to the rear. This room was acceptable and quiet but had a terrible view.The on site resturant was crowded and pricey. The food was good though. Next door is an Italian place that has good food and is much cheaper. Walgreens is down the street for incidentals.The concierge (an asian man) was very helpful. The desk clerk(an asian female) was very nice and let me use the internet for free.
156,2202,Oct 15 2006	Did not sleep	I had to be moved to another room after a few hours because I found hugh bed bugs.
157,2202,"Oct 9 2006 	Good value--happy with our stay	My fiance and I were spending four nights in San Francisco. We were looking for a decent hotel, with a good location that wouldn't break the bank. Villa Florence was a good choice for us and I would recommend. We requested a room on the interior, and it was very quiet. The first room we had was supposedly non-smoking, but it still smelled. They moved us immediately to a room that did not smell like smoke. The queen room at the AAA rate was sold out, so we had a king room. The room was a nice size--king bed, desk area, sitting chair, tv and 3-draw dresser. The bed was very comfortable--comfy mattress, pillows, and cozy blanket. It also had AC which we did not need b/c it was cold, but I think that it is a good feature to have just in case. The bathroom was on the small size--but it was completely adequate. We were only staying there for 4 nights--not moving in! The hotel was clean, the front desk and staff were helpful in giving directions, etc. The location was really fantastic--it was close to the cable car starting point (which is good b/c they are so crowded) and are also very close to many train and bus lines, which I thought were the better ways to see the city. We didn't actually do much in union square (we ate dinner and saw sights in other areas) but I still think it was a good place for a home base. We paid $149 (w/o tax) per night. The queen rate was about $20 less. I would recommend Villa Florence to people who are looking for a good value, and would rather spend their money elsewhere (good food, shopping) while in SF. We would stay here again and would recommend it to others. One last thing--it was really cold when we were there (end of August), especially when we did things on the water, like Alcatraz and fisherman's wharf. I wish I had brought some sweaters and gloves!"
158,2202,"Oct 9 2006	Loved it. Great old world charm and character	1.Great Location. On Powell between Saks and Nordstoms2. Minutes from the Powell/Hyde Cable car3. Comfy beds4. Aveda Bath Products5. Comp Coffee am and Wine pm6. Top Shelf, Classy Staff7. Giant Cuddly robes8. Pastry shops on both sides9. About 1 mile from all that matters in San Francisco"
159,2202,"Sep 27 2006 	Was NOT good 2nd time around	We had stayed at the Villa Florence for a few nights last year and loved it; however on our return we were checked into an executive room (the same as we had booked before) but on the 2nd floor.We went up expecting a similar room to last time albeit on a lower floor; we were wrong. The room was much smaller. It may be that in square footage it was the same (although i doubt it) but the space was arranged so that you had a nice large area with nothing in it by the door, follwed by a bed, sofa, chairs, chest of drawers and tv crammed into the other part of the room.As we were geting married the next day and had expected a similar room to last time we went back to reception ask if we could change. We had checked in quite late so they had no other executive rooms available and looked at us like we were stupid, explaining that it was an executive room that we were in and that they were all the same (except for the fact we were on a low floor after requesting a high one and in a corner).As we weren't getting anywhere we just left it.The night that we were married we arrived back at the hotel to find live music being played to a crowd in the lobby. Coincidentally our room was directly above the lobby and we could hear every beat until the last at 9pm.As we woke in the morning (every morning) we could hear clattering in the hallway, upon closer inspection we found we were across from a board room and general meeting point... Fabulous!Aside from these minor irritations we often felt the staff were talking down to us and were generally snotty, for want of a better word.After walking around the area we decided that we would check out the Chancellor and the Handlery next time we are in the city as their locations are very close to the Villa Florence, whose location is only thing we were satisfied with during our stay."
160,2202,"Sep 4 2006	Happy.... I wasn't	It could have been the hotel was fully booked, it could have been I made the reservation through Priceline, it could have been bad luck, but happy ... I wasn't. True, the hotel has a good location but that can't overcome the fact of the tiny spartan room I was given. No chairs, no desk, no tables. Only a bed which occupied two thirds of the room, and an enormous (at leat for the room size) TV set (encased in one of those mamoth pieces of furniture.) Bathroom: small shower where it was impossible to turn my body (and I am underweight) without opening its plastic door. An incongrous big lavatory with a tiny faucet. A view to an interior patio. Windows decorated from the outside with bird excrement. And top of all, a ghost drank half a bottle of juice from the minibar. Should this be a two star hotel I would assume those faults as expectable, but for one that grades itself as as boutique hotel, well, great disappointment."
161,2202,Aug 28 2006 	Great hotel location and Kulettos	we stayed here for five nights last week - have to say that this was a great stay - nice room - best of all is the foyer area and the restaurant - you will need to be careful - its so good you mightent get to try other sfo restaurants - well done to all concerned
162,2202,"Aug 20 2006 	Loved it!!!	My wife and I recently spent 4 nights at the Villa Florence with our 2 teenage sons. The room was spacious enough with a king sized bed and a queen pullout. We asked for a quiet room and were very impressed with the lack of noise from both outside and from neighboring rooms. We heard nothing. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was powerfull. The small fitness room has a couple of treadmills and 2 elipticals. I'm a fitness buff and it was enough for me. You couldn't ask for a better location. It is located seconds from Union Square and all of the great shopping and restaraunts. As soon as you walk out the door you are in the middle of hustle and bustle which makes it very exciting if you are looking for that kind of holiday. We decided not to rent a car because of the hotel's proximity to the very efficient transit system. If you plan on using public transit buy a pass for the amount of time you plan on being there. You can get anywhere on the series of cable cars, buses, streetcars and subways and all of the stops are within walking distance from the hotel. The hotel offers free coffee tasting in the lobby each morning and free wine tasting every evening. Nice touch. The restaraunt, Kuletos is one of the best Italian eateries in town. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. I'd stay there again in a flash."
163,2202,"Aug 3 2006 	Great Hotel in a Great Location	I just stayed at this hotel for 5 days and I had a room facing Powell Street. If you want a quiet room, make sure you ask for a room away from the street as it can get very noisy late at night. It didn't matter to me because I was on holidays but other people may not like it. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice and the service was good. The Kuletos cafe attached to the hotel is also very convenient for a quick muffin in the morning."
164,2202,"Jul 28 2006 	I hardly slept at all during my stay!	My husband and I had a terrible stay at this hotel. It was in a convenient location and we found most of the staff to be pleasant, but the noise level coming from music at a nearby bar was so high, that we hardly slept a wink! The music was vibrating my bed it was so loud! When I complained to the front desk, they said that the police had been notified and the problem would be taken care of shortly. It never was. We were moved to a new room the next night, but A/C unit was humming noisily. I do not recommend this hotel."
165,2202,"Jul 18 2006	Would definitely stay again	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel very much. They were very professional and I think it's a very nice hotel. They were helpful and accomodating. We stayed in a &quot;double double&quot; room, which was larger than a standard 2 double bed room and it was very adequate in size. The room was clean. It also had a big closet to store our luggage but they didn't have much shelf space to put clothes. There was a dresser with 3 drawers and that was it. The bathroom was large, except there wasn't much space for toiletries, so we had to be creative. The shower was good; It didn't change water temperature while using it and the spray was strong. Thanks to suggestions of other reviewers, we requested a room that was not on the main street and was much quieter. However, you do have to give up any kind of view and some natural light. It was a tradeoff we were glad we made though. They were nice enough to clear out the mini bar so that we could use it as a refrigerator. The pillows and comforter were made of down. The TV was a Sony flat screen and there was a DVD player and CD clock radio. The lobby area was also very nice. The concierge was helpful. The hotel is very well located. I would definitely stay there again."
166,2202,"Jul 2 2006	Smelly Smelly Smelly!! Tiny Bathroom!!! Can't stand it anymore.	We stayed in Villa Florence last week, and we were expecting the room was very italian style. However, the room is sooooooo tiny, same as the bathroom. It's really hard to turn around if you stand in the bathroom. And, it's kind of smelly. Additionally, we felt like too itchy to endure while sleeping. I would never do it again."
167,2202,"Jun 6 2006	Noisy Noisy Noisy	Small hotel close to Union Square on cable car line. Concierge at front door however no help with bags when we arrived. When we checked in we were asked if we wanted a room with a view or a quiet room. Apparently the rooms that have the view look out onto the street and it is noisy because of the cable car. The receptionist said they were both the same size so we opted for the quiet room. Bad mistake!! We were on the second floor and at first I thought the person in the next room was playing loud music day and night. I didnt complain. Once I have unpacked I dont want to repack to move to the next floor. Room was dark and dingy because we in fact did have a view but it was of the extractor fans and roof so we kept the shutters closed. It had a king size bed, a small desk, a bar fridge that was locked. Very tired hotel and although it has a good location, there are several hotels in the same location. Would not choose this hotel again or recommend it."
168,2202,Jun 3 2006	Charming hotel excellent service	I spent 7 nights at the Villa Florence while I attended a conference. I ended up staying in a room on the Powell street side. The room was small but nice. It was quite noisy but I didn't seem to have any problems sleeping. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the down pillows and comforter. The location was convenient and safe. The staff were attentive and courteous. The service was excellent.
169,2202,"May 24 2006	Great 	The lobby is busy with a bar and an italian eatery. Always full. The staff speaks all versions of English. You may have to spell your name a few times. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are small and nice. The Palace did not have an honor bar, the Hilton did not have an honor bar the Villa did.Biggest bummer: the shower head. It is for short people. I stand 5' 10&quot; and had to bend forward to wash hair. Bend forward (lesson learned). The room is small and you dont walk around with bathroom door open. Has a nice sized closet. Biggest pro.: the simple amount of energy always around. Great place, great location.Whiners need not go there. Rooms are clean. The cleaning staff was great when we left a jacket in the closet. Held it for us for nearly two weeks.Now pay attention if you like loud and noisy stay on that side. I took the quiet room. Nice and quiet with a panaramic view of the roof of something and the next building.I booked this on Priceline for under a hundred including taxes."
170,2202,"May 15 2006	Great small hotel	The Villa Florence is a small boutique type hotel that is right on the streetcar line and a half of block from union Square. The hotel is clean, newly refurbished and has a nice dinning area. Very European feel and excellent service. Some of the queen rooms are quite small and some are just right so be sure to ask for the largest size or get a king room. a little more money but worth it. I'm confident you will love this intiimate hotel and it's dining room ---as well as its location --many neat stores and dining places nearby."
171,2202,"May 14 2006	Haven't tried to sleep in a place this noisy since college!!!	First, the positives. Excellent location, reasonable rates, great restaurant in the lobby.The negatives, however, were pretty negative. The biggest was the noise. The THUMP, THUMP, THUMP of bass lines from abysmal late-70s/early-80s power rock was impossible to ignore. I have no idea where it was coming from, but I suspect it was from bar or club next door or somewhere else in the building. We called downstairs several times, only to be provided with wildly inconsistent answers:5 pm: &quot;Its usually quiet on your floor. We will look into it and call you back&quot;. -- No return phone call7 pm: &quot;We will look into it.&quot;10 pm (after we return from dinner out): &quot;We have no control over that noise.&quot; Huh? I thought it was supposed to usually be quiet on my floor. And maybe &quot;I'm sorry about the noise&quot; would have been nice?1:00 am: &quot;It's usually quiet by 1:30 or 2. We'll call the police to look into it.&quot;1:45 am - the music finally stopped.So, if you are interested in actually getting some sleep before 2 am, I'd choose another hotel. If you are planning to go out until 2 in the morning and then go to sleep, it might be a great place for you."
172,2202,"May 1 2006	Great hotel and location	Charming hotel in Union Square, close to shopping and a block from the cable car turnaround. Small room, but tastefully decorated. Staff was very nice and helpful; wine reception was also a nice touch. I got a great deal on Priceline ($70), so was very pleased with the accommodations! If you want a quiet room, suggest requesting a room in the back - no view, but it is quiet."
173,2202,"Apr 20 2006	great experience and great deal	We stayed for five days. Luckily (oddly enough) there was a water leak in our bathroom. The first room we checked into was TINY (but livable and beautifully decorated) and had a water leak in the bathroom. That room was right on the the cable car route, so noisy. Anyway, they switched us to a different room, and the concierge said that being there 5 nights we would not want to be on that side of the building, so he moved us into a much larger room, no leaks, and very quiet. The service was great from the concierge's, and most desk staff were fine. Kulettos (the restaurant on site) was DELICOUS and classy. A little pricey but worth the splurge. The evening wine reception was also great, the wine was fantastic, the hostess super nice.ALot of homelessness and panhandling in the area, but so close to macy's, niketown, nordstroms etc, as wella s the cable car turnaround. I would definitely stay again, and we got a super good deal through travelocity."
174,2202,"Apr 10 2006 	Nice atmosphere great location but small rooms	I liked this hotel. Booked through Priceline, so got a good rate ($90), but would definitely consider returning even if I had to pay more.Room was small, as you would expect at a boutique hotel. The whole building shows its age, with a few cracks here and there, but is very clean. Decor is in keeping with the style of the hotel. It was on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. You can definitely hear the street noise, but I am not a light sleeper, so it didn't bother me. The alternative seemed to be rooms at the back with views of brick walls, so if a quiet room with a view is a priority for you, this might not be the best place.Location is great - right in the center of things. Lobby is always full of bustle. In all, the place had much more character than the business hotels I generally end up staying at. Service was good - everybody I spoke to was very pleasant and attentive.Nice place, but not ultra-luxury by any means"
175,2202,"Mar 25 2006	Great location	This hotel was very nice; ambience was great and the everything was clean. Staff was responsive. Location was the absolute strength of this place, 1/2 block from union square. The rooms, however, were small. I would definely recommend this hotel. That said, I wouldn't pay full price (I got it from priceline) for this hotel because of the small rooms--search around for good deals on the place."
176,2202,"Mar 14 2006	Just right for us	The Villa Florence was exactly what we needed. The restaurant in the lobby, Kuletos, was excellent though there was a small swarm of gnats flying around their fresh flowers. The cable car stop is across the street so very convenient. Staff was helpful, friendly and responsive. The room was small but extremely clean and even though we faced the street, noise was not an issue (except for the cable car giving me a wake-up call at 6:30 a.m. every morning- just part of the charm). The price was reasonable, too. After several trips to SF, this is the first time I can say I would definitely choose this hotel again."
177,2202,"Jan 21 2006	loved the Villa Florence!!!	My husband &amp; I loved this hotel! The king size bed was just like a Westin heavenly bed. It was so comfy, we didn't want to come home. This is an excellent location within walking distance to all the shopping areas, and it is directly on the trolley route. We would definitely stay here again."
178,2202,"Jan 9 2006	watch out for the internet special	I paid $189.00 for a studio suite. The view was awful- sides of buildings only, not even any sunlight and the studio was tiny. My other complaint was that the &quot;complimentary coffee&quot; served in the lobby is whisked away promptly at eight in the morning. Most of us on Sunday morning arrive a little later than eight. That seems obsessively cheap to me. However, the hotel room was clean and the staff were all nice. Still, I won't stay there again."
179,2202,"Jan 5 2006	Great for the Price!	Stayed at the Villa Florence as part of a Site 59 package and was very pleased. Rooms are cozy and comfortable and we slept great. Bathrooms are spacious. It's a three star Kimpton hotel and as with all Kimpton hotels is very consistent, so if you are travelling on your own dime, its a good deal. Downstairs restaurant is very good - no room service, but you'll live."
180,2202,"Jan 1 2006	Great Experience	Two friends &amp; myself spent a night at the Villa Florence during the week after Christmas. It was truly a wonderful holiday treat. Every member of the staff was pleasant and helpful. The hotel is attractively decorated. We reserved an Executive Suite, which was spacious, cheeful &amp; very clean. We had a room on the 6th floor away from Post Street &amp; it was very quiet. We were within a block of Union Square, shopping and theaters. It was a great San Francisco experience at a very reasonable price. We'll be back again."
181,2202,"Dec 30 2005	Perfect Location	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Villa Florence on December 20th. The Villa Florence is 1/2 block from Union Square which is the perfect location for shopping. We used priceline.com and only paid $75 + Tax + $35 for Valet 24 hour parking. We stayed on the 7th floor in a room facing the street. The room was small but comfortable with a queen bed (very comfortable), TV, DVD Player (Bring DVD movies as they don't have any to check out), Desk, and very small bathroom with shower/tub (you can almost use the toilet while brushing your teeth). They did provide Aveda tolieteries which was a nice touch. The lobby is very nice with a wine bar, deli, and restaurant. We would definitely stay here again, especially if we could get another great deal on priceline"
182,2202,Nov 30 2005	Loved the Villa Florence Hotel	This hotel has a very convenient location 1/2 a block from Union Square. It has been completely remodeled and nicely decorated. The room was nice with a great comfortable King size bed with down comforter. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a WineReception each night which was fun before dinner.I would highly recommend this hotel.
183,2202,"Nov 16 2005	generally good	wonderfully located the villa florence with some slight tweaks, could be excellent. our room was smallish with a view of an ugly brick wall yet was nicely done in that designer hip style that kimpton hotels seems so good at. why then the cheap toilet seat and crummy fixtures in the otherwise nicely decorated bathroom? the queen bed was great very very comfortable and the room was very clean. the staff tho nice seemed befuddled and had trouble with a request i made for a 15.00 voucher for a future visit if you book at their website. lastly the free wine reception needs improvement. it should be obvious where to go and real wine glasses should be used and the cheap merlo should be replaced with something just a little better. all in all a good non plastic hotel experience at a close to fair price. ark"
184,2202,"Nov 16 2005	Good choice for downtown San Francisco	We stayed at Hotel Villa Florence for 5 nights in October. As the other reviews suggest do ask for a room that doesn't overlook the street so you are guaranteed a quiet night's sleep. Overall the hotel is clean, front desk staff and concierge friendly, and if you can get in a walk-in rate of around $140 -it is a very good deal as it is centrally located (especially if you are up for some shopping!)"
185,2202,"Nov 3 2005	Not exactly soundproof	Four other couples and us chose this hotel for my husband's 40th birthday celebration. To make the story short we paid two hundred dollars a night for a night of unrest. Three of our rooms were facing the street and we could hear all the noises from the street ( the cable car, voices of people partying to the trafic horns) as if the windows were open. None us slept that nigt and neither the centric location nor the nice decoration of the hotel and the rooms could make up for our lack of sleep.We wont go there anytime soon!"
186,2202,"Oct 15 2005 	Wonderful place in SF	This is a great hotel in the heart of Union Square. So cool to have cable cars out your door. Convenient to shop the area or walk to Moscone Center. We did both during our 4 nights stay. Location, location, location! The rooms are adequate in size. Took the advise of others from this website and got a back room on the top floor - slept like a baby in their comfortable beds. Everyone on the staff was friendly and helpful. Very exciting to bump into international travelers at this hotel, especially over the complementary wine at happy hour. Only downer was that the room had a musty odor on first entry. This cleared promptly and was not a problem later by leaving the fan/ac on continuously for the next few days. This is definitely better than other hotels in the same price range for Union Square. We will be returning to the Hotel Villa Florence. Ciao!"
187,2202,"Aug 30 2005	Good deal	Villa Florence located right in the heart of Union Square -- great location -- block down from the St. Francis. Older hotel renovated but quite nicely. Rooms are perfectly adequate -- a bit small with Queen size bed. Do, however, ask for a quiet room. A friend had a room on the street side and heard a lot of noise when a nearby club closed and street noise. Staff is very helpful and nice wine at their happy hour.Would certainy recommend this hotel."
188,2202,"Aug 17 2005	Lovely place great location	My fiance and I stayed here for four nights, and we thought it was really nice. He grew up in San Francisco, so we weren't surprised by cost of parking off sight and such. We were pleasantly surprised at how cute this boutique hotel is. We requested a room not on the street side, and we were totally satisfied. I LOVED the convenient location to walk out of the hotel and into the hustle and bustle of Union Square. We did some great shopping there.We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in the hotel restaurant.By the way, we conveniently took BART from the airport to a stop close to the hotel."
189,2202,"Aug 13 2005	Great hotel in Union Square!	Of course I am just now getting to the review of the Hotel Villa Florence. We LOVED it here! We stayed for three nights, our first trip to San Fran. I booked it based on reviews and was really pleasantly surprised. The hotel is a boutique hotel, older, and has been renovated. Our room was incredibly quiet (fifth floor), had an excellent King bed, gorgeous down comforter, and Aveda products in the (small, but clean) bathroom. We talked up our experience of a B&amp;B feel in a hotel in the city. We definitely hit up the free wine hour daily. The only issue (and it was a non-issue for us), is that our floor would have been incredibly difficult to navigate if in a wheelchair. I travel with a chair-bound person often, and it would have been stressful for him to get through the narrow and often winding hallways. I didn't see what a handicap room (or floor) looked like, but I am sure the hotel staff would go out of their way to accomodate, as they do for everyone we saw!If you are going to SF to be a tourist, be a tourist--the Villa Florence is feet from two different trolley stops, so it is really simple to get to the wharf. It worked out well to stay here--we were budget minded--but still be able to get to the wharf and other areas on the bay.Don't bring a car to SF. We rented one, but knew it would've been better to get a shuttle or car from the airport and just taxi around when we wanted to leave. It was expensive and hard to get around the city (we're from Ohio and not used to the hills). Stay here, keep and open mind, and you will love it. The manager actually emailed me to thank me for filling out a comment card I mailed to the hotel after our stay. I forwarded it to my friends who were planning a trip to SF and he gave them a great rate AND emailed me to thank me again for our patronage and for referring another couple. He didn't have to do that!!!'Have fun. If you go to Wine Country, check out Davis Bynum on West Wine Road in Healsburg. Ask for Richard, he will treat you like royalty."
190,2202,"Aug 6 2005	Thoroughly Enjoyed our Stay	We stayed at the Villa Florence at the end of a world wind trip through California. Having stayed in B&amp;B's during our trip we were prepared for the impersonal nature of staying in a regular hotel. But not here. We arrived very early and the staff was extemely gracious quickly preparing a room, assisting us with our car rental return and generally making us feel like a VIP even though we were not. We did request a quiet room away from Powell Street which I highly recommend. The cable car line runs right in front of the hotel which is very convenient however a bit noisy. Our room was very spacious and beautifully appointed. This was a delight for us and a great way to spend the last two days of our California trip."
191,2202,"Jun 29 2005	Great value for money	In comparison to the quality of our 3 star hotel in Los Angeles on the same trip the Villa Florence was well above par. We booked our holiday all together (including flights and accomodation) so given the money which actually went to the hotel we got extremely good value in comparison.The location was ideal for transfer from the airport, cable cars, buses and plenty of shopping. The room although slightly small was nicely decorated and always clean. The staff were helpful whenever we needed it and were very welcoming. If I were to visit San Francisco again I would definately stay here again"
192,2202,"Jun 12 2005	Pretty Good Place	We stayed for 3 nights (May 20,21,22,23) using Expedia, where we specifically requested a quiet room. We received most of what we wanted, which was a quiet room but with a double instead of a queen size bed. There was a huge Orthodontist convention in SF, and the place was fully booked.Yes, the rooms are a bit small, but the 2 of us found that it was fine. You should be out for most of the day anyway. We booked a winery tour that Sunday using Tours SF, which was great because they use the smaller 20 passenger mini, air conditioned buses. Just ask the concierge to book your tour. They try to get you to use GreyLine, but why cram yourself in with 45 other people, if for the same price, you can go with a smaller group. The guide was excellent pointing out the history of SF and when the wineries got started. Back across the Golden Gate bridge on the return and to the hotel.Be sure to visit Nob Hill; get yourself a one or three day transit pass instead of renting a car. Parking is VERY expensive US$35 at many places overnight. Lots of shopping such as Neiman Marcus; Macy's; and the Museum of Modern Art is a quick 10 minute walk. Enjoy a visit to SF. We hope to come back again in a year or two."
193,2202,"Jun 12 2005	Charming in a Fawlty Towers kind of way	For those of you who aren't familar with Fawlty Towers, it's a 1970s English television comedy about an inept hotel owner struggling to keep on top of running his business. He tries his best, but keeps making mistakes and at times this was the case with the Villa Florence!First the advantages -- the location is superb, just off Union Square and literally two minutes from the Powell Street cable car turnaround and BART station. The restaurant, Cafe Kuletos, is wonderful and seemed to be constantly full, always a good sign.We stayed at the hotel for four nights in May. Our first room, on the second floor, was tiny and smelled of damp, but we were so jetlagged we didn't have the energy to complain. Because my husband's bag had been lost, I put his clothes in the so-called &quot;express&quot; overnight laundry service -- but when I rang to enquire about it the next morning, I was told it hadn't been collected and that &quot;this happened every so often&quot;. Not a great start and the staff member wasn't exactly very apologetic.We asked to be moved on our second day and got a much brighter room on the fifth floor -- however it was facing onto Powell Street, which meant it was very noisy. I get the impression that when staying at the Villa Florence, it's a choice between a bright, noisy room or a dark, damp quiet one. The rooms have been decorated quite nicely but are let down by small details -- our iron was missing, we never got any bathrobes despite asking for them twice, and our ironing board was broken -- as I discovered when part of it hit me on the head!Overall, if you're looking for a well located, cheap and cheerful hotel then you'll probably get on fine at the Villa Florence -- but don't expect any luxuries!!"
194,2202,"Jun 9 2005	Reasonable hotel - little ovepriced	Stayed here with my husband for 2 nights, booked it before I read some of the previous reviews for this hotel so we felt a little apprehensive as to the condition of our room. We need not have worried as we found the room, although the decor was a little tired, perfectly clean and acceptable, the bed was excellent and all the plumbing worked satisfactorily. Our room faced the street and so there was some noise from the cable cars but not too bad. Unfortunately on the second night they were errecting a new shop front across the road throughout the night which was VERY noisy, but this was not the fault of the hotel although if I went again we might ask for a more quiet room. Tried the breakfast in the hotel which was very good but expensive, didn't try the restaurant Kuletos but it seemed very popular. Overall a pleasant enough hotel maybe a little overpriced"
195,2202,"May 28 2005 	Italian style??	This is an old hotel right dowtown San Francisco. To my opinion it is somewhat overdone to value so much the Italian style. You should go there if you like good value for money, at a perfect but busy location.My room was small and very noisy. I know now that cable cars start to run at 6 a.m. and continue to do so till 12 p.m., and they are really noisy!! I would return to this hotel, but I would ask then for another room not at the street side."
196,2202,"Apr 26 2005	When can we go back?!	My husband and I stayed at the Villa Florence on our first trip to San Francisco, April 17-21. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel! The location is perfect! We took the Bart from SFO to Union Square and the hotel was only about 2 blocks from the station. The cable car turnaround was also only 2 blocks away - so we never had to go far!! Plus, the hotel is within walking distance of great food, shopping, and even the entrance to Chinatown.We arrived at the hotel early (around noon) and the staff was more than helpful in finding us a room that was already ready for check-in. We were even asked which room we would prefer: street side or quiet side. We requested a quiet room and didn't have a problem with noise the entire trip.The beds were WONDERFUL and the room was very nice. I was nervous about the bathroom size based on the other reviews, but our bathroom wasn't that small at all! It wasn't as large as a hotel that was built in the last 20 years, but it was big enough! Small price to pay for the beautiful history and architecture!Bottom line: we'd DEFINITELY stay at the Villa Florence again!"
197,2202,"Apr 14 2005	You get what you paid for	The Villa Florence is very conveniently located in Union Square. The hotel is small and quaint. The $40 valet parking fee is outrageous (including parking tax and in/out privileges). If you plan to have a car in the city, look for the overnight specials on O'Farrell, and you will have to move your car in the morning.  The biggest problem is the general appearance and lack of cleanliness of the rooms. The walls needed a new paint job. We actually saw a one cock roach, and immediately sealed our luggages. If you are looking for a bargain hotel, and just a place to sleep, this hotel is fine. If you want to brag to your buddies, about where you stayed you can stay at the Four Seasons nearby."
198,2202,"Apr 11 2005	I'd rather stay at a Motel 6	My wife and I stayed at this hotel while we were in town for a friend's wedding. The hotel was one of three suggested in the wedding invitation, so we didn't bother to research it. Too bad for us. We paid $150 for one night. Guess what? Parking is extra--$35 PER DAY to be exact. The hotel itself does not have a garage though, so when you want to retrieve your car, you'll need to wait at least 15 minutes for a valet to drive it to the hotel from a distant facility.The rooms really left a lot to be desired. The wallpaper in our room was probably fairly old, as it was peeling away at the edges. The baseboard and ceiling molding was very dinged up and appeared to have been painted so many times that much of the detail was lost. This may seem like nitpicking, but it really contributed to the impression that the hotel was simply old and in need of real renovation.When the bellhop escorted us to our room, he made a point of telling us that the hotel had recently undergone several upgrades, including new beds, new carpets and new televisions. The bed and the carpet were fine, and the TV was certainly new, but the reception was not much better than could be obtained with a pair of rabbit ears.When I first tried to take a shower, I was not able to get any hot water. I called down to the desk to inquire if they were aware of any problems with the hot water delivery and was instructed to let the water run for about 5 minutes. That worked, though it was certainly wasteful and inconvenient. I should mention that we were only on the third floor. Assuming the hot water is pumped from the basement, I wonder how long one would have to wait if on the top floor? Additionally, after flushing, the toilet in our room required about 15 minutes to shut off. The tank filled up promptly, but for whatever reason, the float didn't shut off the valve.Lastly, for $150 per night, one might expect the the chain to at least splurge on the TP and Kleenex, but as with everything else, the price tag doesn't reflect the reality. These two amenities were of the single-ply sandpaper variety.I'd have been much happer at a Motel 6. It would have cost considerably less and the facilities would probably have been in much better shape."
199,2202,"Apr 1 2005	Villa Loving It	This is my second stay at Villa Florence, this time with my wife who is more picky than I am. We loved it. I would recommend an interior room for less noise, although the exterior rooms have great views. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the evening free wine hour, and really liked the wine bar's selections, including a special flight of three red zinfidels (including a Rosenblum) for only $9. The bed was great, the room was spacious, and we had a large flat screen tv. Kuleto's is a fun restaurant, and you can get the same menu at the informal wine bar, which is a boon if your plane gets in late. You will not find a better location than this. We were a half block from Union Square and Macy's and right on the Cable car lines. Only down side, our heating/cooling system was tempermental. No problem mon. Did I mention we spent under $400 for 4 nights on our American Airlines vacation plan during spring break? Nuff said.Restaurants? Try Cafe Claude, a GREAT french restaurant with GREAT prices. For a once in a lifetime meal, do Restaurant Gary Danko, which has heavenly service, and marvelous food, similar to Charlie Trotter's in Chicago. Beer? Toranado in the Haight has the best beer selection ever. Jack's at the Wharf has 85 beers on tap including Chimay. Also, the Anchor beer tour is by far the best I've ever done."
200,2202,"Mar 26 2005	Wonderful Service	This is a boutique hotel, right in the center of downtown San Francisco. The rooms are on small side, but beautifully decorated and comfortable. The bathroom is very small but only adds to the character of the hotel.What makes this hotel is the great SERVICE. The complimentary wine or pop every evening is a nice addition.The parking is very pricey at $35 per day for valet. I booked through priceline, so my total cost was still under a $100 per night. One word of Caution when visiting San Francisco...Always have a map on hand, the Taxi drivers tend to take the long way. We had a trip.... going to the restaurant was $10 coming back was $4.50."
201,2202,Mar 19 2005	Great boutique hotel	Perfect location ....Great food downstairs in Kuletos .. valet and staff very friendly
202,2202,"Mar 19 2005	Great location!!	Stayed at Villa Florence last weekend for 3 nights.It was the ideal location for walking, shopping, and getting on public transport to anywhere really.Room was quite clean, but needs a bit of attention to maintenance of tiling in tub, shower-curtain(patched), and paintwork. Good A/C.Staff very attentive and friendly without being too ingratiating; and the restaurant: Kuleto's, was just excellent!!! Try the organic chicken,mmmm!!The desk was great at storing our luggage, as we arrived at 10:00 am; and when we were waiting to leave for the airport at 5:30 pm.Bathrooms are very small, but lots of thick snowy towels, and Aveda toiletries. Sink a little strange, in that the faucet pours the water straight down the back of the basin, making it difficult to wash under running water!Didn't seem to be a local TV channel on the TV, so hard to pick up local news, which is what I like to do in a new city.Very comfy bed, and if you get a room at the back you will not see out to anything other than a wall, but it will be much quieter than one at the front. Believe me, Powell Street is noisy 24 hours a day!!!We would stay there again, and certainly would try out other Kimpton Hotels."
203,2202,"Mar 17 2005	Nice Hotel Nice Location.	We shopped and got a great rate on this hotel that is half a block off Union Square in San Francisco. 3 blocks from the Powell St. BART station, and steps away from world-class (and some budget class) shopping, the Villa Florence is a treat. Large, very clean room with nice comfy furniture, quiet (we got a room that does not face the street) and the nicest desk/concierge/door staff you will ever meet. The A/C unit took some finesse to get the room temp correct, but in San Francisco, this is hardly an issue most of the time (it was unseasonably warm when we visited). Kulettos restaurant off the lobby is higher-end dining (but not overpriced) and served us a truly wonderful dinner. We walked everywhere in the city (don't bring or rent a car, BART is too easy and fast and cabs are everywhere). We left with smiles, an will be happy to return."
204,2202,"Feb 28 2005	terrible service	i am still in shock from the absolutely horrendous experience i had at this hotel. i cant believe this is a kimpton property. the rooms are cramped, the bathrooms dreadful, the beds uncomfortable, the noise from the streetcars on Powell completely over the top, and the serivice, well, jawdroppingly bad. the valet lost the keys to my rental car and proceeded to spend the next hour melodramatically checking his pockets and rifling through drawers and making excuses and acting like i had seriously inconvenienced _him_. at one point, he actually suggested that i pay for a tow truck for the car and then submit the receipt (!!). and this wasn't the only issue. i would write more, but i am too exhausted from this ordeal. my advice: avoid this place at all cost."
205,2202,"Feb 25 2005	Perfect Stay	My Husband and I stayed at the Hotel Villa Florence over a long Valentines weekend. I had not one complaint. We had an executive king room with a down comforter and pillows. there was a sofa and chair and the bathroom was pretty big. I also loved that they provided us with bathrobes. The front dest staff was great and the concierge, Autoro, was wonderful. He is a San Francisco native and will be able to tell you everything about the city that you are intrested in. He reccomended some great restaurants to us. We ate a Kuletos one evening and it was excellent. Kimpton hotel are always great and the Villa Florence was no exception."
206,2202,"Jan 18 2005	Terrific Boutique Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Villa Florence over Labor Day weekend, and it was a perfect spot. No need to have a car, the BART is near if you are coming in from the airport, as well as the trolley just down the block and cabs are plentiful. We loved the complimentary wine and the decor of the lobby. We received friendly help with restaurant recommendations and were pleased over their suggestions. Loved the Aveda products and even though the room was small, it was cozy and it's not as if you are going to the city by the bay to stay in your room the whole time anyway! I have recommended to friends to stay there and will definitely return to the Villa Florence. It reminded me of European boutique hotels that I've stayed in."
207,2202,"Jan 14 2005	location location location	If location is your priority at a reasonable rate, without great luxuries, ck. this hotel. Conveniently located right at Union Square, withinwalking distance to superb restaurants, great shopping &amp; a cable car stop right in front of the door. Front desk staff very friendly &amp; helpful. Room was OK with a separate seating area, but the bathroom was the smallest ever had."
208,2202,"Dec 10 2004	Great location small room	OK, so the room was tiny, parking is expensive (~30 a day for valet parking)... but LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!Parking is expensive anywhere downtown San Fran.... so if you stay in this hotel, you dont need a car. Bonus, there is a cable car stop right outside.. really easy to get to Pier 39, Alcatraz, Fisherman's Wharf, The Cannery, etc.There is a nice restaurant in the hotel as well as nearby.The hotel is situated very close to union sq... an almost perfect location... without paying the big bucks... it is in fact a better location than many of the big names.. but you wont be paying as much.However, we did get a VERY small room... and a tiny bathroom.. Overall, very happy campers!"
209,2202,"Nov 15 2004	Brilliant	I stayed at the Villa Florence in Oct 2004 for 4 nights.. and it was excellent. I asked for a quiet room upon booking... and it was extremely quiet, really lovely fit-out, v. large room and beautiful aveda bathroom products. They also had free yoga mats and blocks should you wish to do a workout and the rooms are large enough so that you could comfortably do so.The location was sensational... half a block from union square a block from the tram station... Highly recommend and will stay there on any return trips to SFO"
210,2202,"Nov 15 2004	Great Location	The Villa Florence is in a great location. The service is quick and the room was clean, although a little hot (couldn't get the temperature down). Overall, definitely worth the price."
211,2202,"Nov 14 2004	Wonderful hotel 	If you want a great experience at a boutique hotel in the city and don't want to spend too much money, the Villa Florence is highly recommended. We stayed there for 4 nights (Nov 9-12, 2004) and requested early check-in, room in a quiet section, on the 5th or 6th floor and 2 double beds. We got all that and more! We only paid $127 CDN per night (special Expedia rate) so it was a great value for what we got. They had a complimentary wine reception each night at 5pm and also had complimentary coffee in the room. As we weren't scheduled to leave SF until late at night, they even stored our luggage after we checked out so we didn't have to carry it around all day. There was no view from our room but we were okay with this since we wanted a quiet atmosphere. The room was a little below average in size - it pretty much fit the 2 beds, a desk, mini fridge and TV with bureau - no sitting area. However, it was very clean. They have white comforters on the beds and they were actually clean! The restaurant next door, Kuletos, is highly recommended!! Probably our best dinner while in SF. Make sure you make a reservation since it gets very busy."
212,2202,"Nov 9 2004	Just Okay	The location is geat, but we had major problems with the valet parking. We arrived on Sunday at around 5pm (busy time in Union Square) and there were cars parked in the valet zone, but no valet parker to move them. After circling around Union Square three times (not an easy task) and calling the hotel to get the cars moved, nothing happened. Finally our friend went in and got the concierge to move the cars. He told us that the valet parker left at 4pm that day. There was also a mix up with the payment of our &quot;pre-paid&quot; reservation. After a confusioning and frustrating conversation, the clerk behind the counter ask my friend if she &quot;needed a glass of wine&quot; intimating that she was hysterical. They made up for their mistakes the next day with complimentary parking and breakfast, but I would twice about staying here again."
213,2202,"Oct 26 2004	Loved the Villa Florence	We stayed four nights at the Villa Florence and loved it! The location is so convenient to everything. We were able to walk to many of the places we went and otherwise used the public transportation, which was also right there. Each morning we had a light breakfast and coffee at Cafe' Kulettos and watched the people walk by as we sat at one of the little sidewalk tables. We also enjoyed the complimentary wine tasting in the evening at the bar. We requested a room in the back of the hotel, so it was very quiet. The bathroom was large and all furnishings looked recently updated. The bed was comfortable, linens were soft, and towels were big and fluffy. Overall, it was a wonderful experience!"
214,2202,"Oct 22 2004	Villa Florence is Perfect	We recently spent one night in San Francisco, en-route to a family wedding. I love the boutique hotels in the City, but wanted to be very central to maximize the short time we had there. Villa Florence fit the bill.It was so easy to get there - took B.A.R.T.($5) from the Airport, the hotel was one block away from the Powell St.Subway and we were at the check-in desk just over one hour after we landed. The lobby is wonderful - reminds me very much of hotels in days gone by - wonderful decor, big comfy sofa and armchairs and full of people and atmosphere. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful and the room was very nice. After reading numerous reviews on your site, we'd requested an inside room - it was very quiet and there was no streeet noise.The location is perfect - Corner of Powell and O'Farrell; all the top department stores, (I was in Nordstroms before you could say &quot;Jet Lag&quot;!). Also, it is right by the Cable Car Turnaround; so getting from Point A to Point B is so easy. Lots of super cafes and restaurants closeby; but, as we were tired, we decided to eat at Kuletos - I would thoroughly recommend it - great food, great service and great atmosphere.When we checked out the following morning, the front desk took care of our luggage until we returned from the Car Rental Office and then brought everything out to the car for us.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for good value for money in a place that is different from the international, generic hotels.Well done Villa Florence."
215,2202,Oct 19 2004	awsome place	we stayed at the villa florence October 9th thru 13th and the Hotel was awsome. The bed was great the employees were very nice and helpful. i would stay there again. Great Place
216,2202,"Oct 16 2004	Great value! terrific stay!	We stayed in the Villa Florence 9/7/2004-9/12/2004, and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel; the location couldn't be more perfect. The decor was charming and the room (comfy bed) was immaculate every day. Our rate was $119 daily. The staff gets five stars; responsive, friendly, great attitudes. Kulletos was as good as advertised. The surprise to us was Kulletos cafe right outside the hotel. it has the finest breakfast items, lunch sandwiches, &amp; sweets that we found in the city. It will spoil for you lessor places. We requested a quiet room after reading the feeding on tripadvisor; our room faced the courtyard; only small problem was that on warmer days the room faced the afternoon sun so the old window air conditioner had trouble keeping up. highly recommend for the price."
217,2202,"Oct 5 2004	A Transit Hub Superb Location	Love Villa Florence. It's located just a few steps from Union Squre and cable stops infront of the hotel. If you like to take a muni bus, or street car, just walk down 2 blocks. which will take you alll over the city, even connect you to Caltrain to nearby vicinity, say Stanford or other places. And if you like to drive out of town, go along the O'Ferrel and you will find all the car rental companies there.Room is fabulously equipped with flat screen TV and DVD players(don't forget to bring yoru DVDs). And in the evening hour, a complementary wine tasting is offered in the lobby. Not mentioned the wonderful restaurant within the hotel -- Kuleto's. You will surely love it.And people. People there was really nice. I'd made 4 orders at Noble&amp;Barner--- and they shipped in 10 more parcels which, were all been taking care by hotel people. Even as a Priceline bidder like me, Tony was so nice to answer all my requests and booked me at a quiet corner room...Thank you Florence. You really made my trip memorable."
218,2202,"Sep 28 2004	A great facade...	What I mean is it is very lovely on the outside in all aspects. The inside and its inner workings are a different story. Our room had a strange odor that I just couldn't pinpoint...ever. The air conditioner above our room outside our THIN widows dripped on our a/c ALL NIGHT LONG. Our clock radio was broken, our remote for the tv was broken and we finally had to go directly to the front desk because NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE. There is also one man who acts as bell man, valet, and taxi grabber...good luck with that! The staff is friendly, Kuletos is wonderful...This is definately a boutique hotel, I would recommend the Prescott (which is also a Kimpton Hotel) if you want boutique but better."
219,2202,"Sep 22 2004	loved villa florence	I stayed in the Villa Florence not too long ago, and found the beds to be fantastic, and the decor charming. It is right next to an excellent restaurant, and in the middle of everything. I think we got some great deal at about $120 per night, and we arrived in the middle of the night, and service was still excellent. I think there is a complimentary wine reception each night also. it is a great location."
220,2202,"Sep 20 2004	Lived up to all expectations	After extensive research on hotels in this price range, the Villa Florence delivered. I travel a lot for work, staying at Hyatts/Marriotts/Hiltons, etc. This is not like those, but I would recommend it if you are looking for a nice smaller hotel. The down bed was extremely comfy, service great (esp Tony Z/X)flat screen tv, and the location was fantastic - very safe and in the middle of everything. Drawbacks? Just a window air conditioner, but it was fine. I looked at the Savoy, a similarly priced hotel, but would not have stayed there due to that hotel's location. Go to the Villa Florence, ask for a larger room on check-in, away from the street, buy a City Pass if you're in San Fran for several days - the street car runs right in front of the hotel!"
221,2202,"Sep 14 2004	Special memories	We will always have special memories of this hotel - as this is where we just got engaged! Of course I'm a bit biased, but that aside - this is a wonderful hotel. Very quiet and the staff was wonderful! Our room was spacious, but we lucked out and received a handicap accesible room. We asked for an inside room and did not hear one bit of the construction taking place across the street. Would definately stay here again!"
222,2202,Sep 8 2004	Good for the Money	Villa Florence was great once we moved to a quiet room with no views but that was better than the loud noise. On the first day we had one bed for the three of us because we booked with hotel. We had to see the next day if there was another room available and there was. The beds are very comfortable and a great location. We paid total of 520.00 for 4 nights 8/16-8/19/2004. Free coffee but it ends at 7:00 a.m. Too early for us.
223,2202,"Sep 7 2004	Enjoyed it!	Very nice hotel and overall well worth the $109 a night we paid. Excellent service, comfortable rooms, very good restaurant, well located. Downsides - rooms are a bit small and the street-front rooms do get noise at night. However, the comfort of the bed made up for the lack of space, and noise is just a chance you take when staying in the heart of Union Square! We enjoyed the benefit of being close to everything."
224,2202,"Aug 20 2004	Che Bella!!	I just returned from two nights at the Villa Florence with my boyfriend. We had a wonderful time staying here. The location is superb-- right in Union Square. There are tons of shopping nearby and good restaurants. Our room was very comfortable. We had a down comforter and soft sheets. Aveda products in the bathroom were a nice extra touch. Although it is not a spacious hotel room, it was sufficient for two people travelling together. The lobby of the hotel is elegant. There is a bar and an upscale Italian restaurant.For the most part, staff was pleasant. One gentleman at the concierge didn't do a very good job of recommending restaurants for people on a budget, or assisting us make reservations, but he was an exception to the others who were mostly kind.We did hear sufficient noise outside our room from the street below in the early morning hours. I would have preferred an inside, courtyard room-- but those rooms were full when we checked in. I was a little disappointed that this could not by accomodated since I had called ahead one week to request a quiet room. I think there was some difficulty requesting this because I reserved this hotel through Priceline (but at $64 a night I wasn't going to complain!)Other nice amenities are the complimentary robes and a complimentary yoga basket to borrow during your stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to others!"
225,2202,"Aug 17 2004	FANTASTIC and FUN	This place is great. I've been to many SF hotels, but now I only stay here. Union Square location is great. It has a great Italian flavor to it too.Kuleto's is a great but pricey place to eat. You must make a stop at the Gold Dust Lounge right next door. WHAT A CRAZY PLACE..AND IT OPENS AT 7:00 am!"
226,2202,"Jul 22 2004	A great hotel	This was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. It's right in the middle of touristy downtown (Powell Street car goes right by the front door and Union Square just steps away). The room I was in was back away from the street (requested when I made the reservation) and it was quiet. Nice furnishings, comfortable bed, big TV. It's an older building so the floor creaks a little, but then again it's billed as an older European-type Italian pensione. I would stay at this hotel again."
227,2202,"Jul 21 2004	Fabulous hotel	My wife and I have just spent 3 nights at the Villa Florence and it really is a cut above most hotels, and great value - we paid $95 + tax. It is very individual with lots of nice touches - nothing like a big chain hotel. The location is excellent, near Union Square and the cable car runs by outside the door! We asked for and got a room at the back which was very quiet - just a view of a wall but that's fine for the lack of noise. Many restaurants nearby and the area is safe."
228,2202,"Jul 20 2004	A wonderful intimate experience!	My wife and I just returned from a four night stay at the Villa Florence. It was one of the most pleasant hotel experiences we have had.The hotel is relatively small. I did not realize how significant this was until I started mentally comparing it to the long treks through gargantuan lobbbies and hallways that are all so common these days at large downtown hotels. As a wonderful contrast, the Villa Florence is intimate, and immediately felt like home.The staff were responsive, courteous, and always helpful. The restaurant at the hotel was wonderful.Some guests have mentioned noise as a problem. When we checked in, I specifically asked for a quiet room. On the fourth floor, where we were, it was absolutely quiet. I literally heard nothing outside the room while we were there.The room was a bit small, but not to the point of a problem. The television was a very nice Sony Trinitron flat scren, complete with a DVD player. The bed was superb, perhaps the most comfortable bed I have ever had in a hotel.I recommend the Villa Florence without reservation. It was a significant part of making our recent SF trip so enjoyable."
229,2202,"Jun 29 2004	Great location price food!	The Villa Florence was a fantastic bargain. I received a rate of $125 per night (incl. taxes) for a large king room from their website. The room amenities were great: Aveda products (yay!), down comforters, sateen sheets, soft wool throws, a CD alarm clock and large tv, along with DVD player. The bed also had a ton of pillows, both down and synthetic filled, which I loved. The view was of the roof and other rooms, but who cared--I was staying there for the location and price, and if I wanted a good view I could go to one of the many high-rise bars/restaurants in Union Square (which I did). The customer service was the best I've ever had, especially at the complimentary wine hour, where the bartender was happy to offer insider recommendations about the city.If you stay here, or even if you don't, you must try Kuleto's restaurant and the cafe. I had dinner in the lobby by the giant fireplace two nights in a row, and to-go sandwiches and fresh fruit from the cafe. There's also an inexpensive, fantastic pizza-by-the-slice place two doors down if you're trying to save money (a huge homemade slice and soda for about $4!).If I go to Union Square again, I'm definitely going to stay at the Villa Florence, and use the money I saved to shop!!!"
230,2202,"Jun 3 2004	Good hotel at great location for a fair price	My first trip to San Francisco but I am a seasoned business traveler. The VF is a nice vintage hotel. It has a great location 1/2 block south of Union Square on Powell Street (cable car line). It is also only a few blocks north of the MUNI/BART station on Market and Powell. Using the MUNI or BART to get to the Embarcadero Area is easy and quick. Walking to the Embarcadero is possible but is approximately a 30 minute walk. There are numerous restaurants in the area for breakfest, dinner, and lunch as well as a few rental car agencies within walking distance for out of town excursions. The surrounding neighborhood is safe for walking around. The VF has a great location.The hotel itself is a refurbishment of an older hotel. This is apparent in the relatively small elevators, rooms, and bathrooms (compared to modern hotels). That said, the rooms are not the smallest I have stayed in and were not the cause of any undue discomfort. The very comfortable, relatively large beds make up for the smallness of the rooms. There is some minor wear noticeable in the walls and bathrooms in the rooms, but that is to be expected in an older building.The ameneties are excellent. The staff is professional and very helpful. The lobby is nicely decorated and a friendly place to hang out. The restaurant attached to the lobby was always busy and receives great reviews, but we were slightly disappointed with our meal.Overall a excellent choice unless you must have the polished feel of a modern hotel. Personnally, this is the perfect hotel for visiting cities with historic ambiance such as New Orleans, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco."
231,2202,"Jun 1 2004	Worth the $$	Stayed at the Villa Florence for three nights and really enjoyed ourselves. The rooms were MUCH smaller than I exspected, but the staff and the free wine hour was wonderful. We had a second floor room and did not hear one bit of noise from the streets. The location is perfect and the ajoiing restaurant, Kuleto's, is one of the best restaurants I've ever been too."
232,2202,"May 6 2004	Villa Florence Wonderful Hotel	Right in the Heart of Union Square and on Powell Street with direct access to the cable cars, this is one hotel I would stay at again. The rooms were recently refurbished and the beds were so comfortable. No street noise from our room and every store you could of wanted was right out the door. Staff was very friendly and accomodating. There was a happy hour that we missed because we had tickets for the night tour to Alcatraz, or else we would of taken advantage of it and the quaint restaurant in the lobby...only wished we were staying longer.."
233,2202,Apr 17 2004	perfect location for the price ditto plus mostly great staff	Just returned from four days at the Villa Florence and the location and price are the winning features PLUS the hotel have just replaced all soft goods and the mattresses were great! The staff were accommodating (although not all were as &quot;empowered&quot; as others) and the charming morning front desk woman switched us to a higher floor &quot;corner&quot; room on the second day which was larger and quieter...do not read that as quiet as you are in the heart of a big city and street noises and sirens are all around you (take ear plugs if you are a sensitive sleeper). The location to the Powell Street Cable Car and Union Square is EXCELLENT and for a clean hotel in a good location under $100 for April it was GRAND. Not a five star hotel but not a five star price. We would all stay there again and we are opinionated and well travelled.
234,2202,"Feb 18 2004	Not Bad Not Bad At All...................	Strange sounding already...HUH????? Not really, although my home is just a 30 minute drive to the &quot;Villa Florence&quot; on Powell St., S.F., CA., I have done this three times over the past SEVEN YEARS......why???? Well, here ya go!!!! For all of you folks who live OUTSIDE of CALIF., listen UP! ! ! I have no interest in Villa Florence and am quite POOR compared to most who stay there BUT I will say I am at an advantage to tell you how they rate and in comparison to other &quot;upscale hotels&quot; in S.F., and I have gone EACH TIME WITH MY ONLY SON, starting from the time he was just &quot;7 yrs&quot; until he was nearly &quot;11 yrs old&quot;. Just the two of us. Since we could NOT afford to go to Hawaii or Mexico or a week, etc., we pretended to be vacationing in San Fran., by staying @ Villa Florence instead, usually from 2-3 days only. BUT, while there we had the illusion we were far away while in our room. The room we asked for was off the main street, Powell St., and was a few floors up overlooking all the traffic/pedestrian, etc. We had a GREAT time, the room was exquisite, we had PPV movies at night for my young son, at night we would bring in GREAT food from just around the corner at a great &quot;Hof Brau&quot; and in the afternoon we would go downstairs to the hotels' restaurant, &quot;Kuleto's&quot; which had a great selection at decent prices. In addition, we had my &quot;espresso's and WONDERFUL &quot;almost crossiants&quot; awaiting me each day. Oh, they also have GREAT &quot;Tiramisu&quot; at the same little cafe right inside. If you are in need of an iron, just ask for it, if you are in need of having clothes washed and pressed STAT, just ask. It is all right there. Too bad, so many people think you must hit the &quot;Top of the Mark&quot; or &quot;Sir Francis&quot; or &quot;Mark Hopkins&quot;, etc., etc., in order to receive such great service..........NOT SO! I am a real native Bay Arean, born in Alameda and I will tell you that Villa Florence is too underrated for so many so far, all over. Try it and you'll find out. I would tell you where to stay away from but I think you will deseve it if you don't listen to me. Have a good time in San Francisco......Johanna Floyd...."
235,2202,"Jan 26 2004	Great location	We stayed in the Villa Florence in Feb 2003 for 3 nights on our way home from a trip to Australia. Great hotel. Room and bathroom waere small but decor makes it very cosy and warm. Very clean and has all the essentials. From our window, we only had a view of another wall of the hotel, and it was noisy in the morning, but we had jet lag so were wide awake at 3am anyway! Manager very helpful by email before we arrived in giving advice on transport from airport. Location is excellent. Right beside Union Square for shopping, restuarants and a good irish pub! Very handy tram stop just outside the hotel door. We paid approx 45 for the room per night. Good value for money."
236,2202,"Dec 15 2003	Double GLAZING!	Just got back from 6 nights at the Villa Florence Hotel, and was compelled to write a review. Overall this is an eloborately decorated hotel, in Italian Renaissance style, associated with Kuleto's a high quality Italian restaurant. I assume it's high quality, because even though we stayed there a week, we couldn't get a reservation to eat there. I found the hotel and it's staff agreeable and helpful, especially during the wine tasting, which takes place every night between 5 and 6 pm. Major kudos for the environmental considerations in the room (you can decide when you want the towels and sheets to be laundered during your stay) and the very expensive AVEDA bathroom products.However, I have only two words for the managers/owners/powers that be in charge of this hotel. DOUBLE GLAZING.Oh MY GOD.Are you kidding me - do you expect anyone to be able to sleep when the trash collector comes round several times from 4 am onward and makes a noise like someone dropping a grand piano out of a window? It sounded like someone had switched on the TV and turned it up loud - that's the level of decibellage we are talking about here. I don't know how much free wine a person would have to drink to sleep through that, but I could never squeeze it into happy hour. Not once. And I tried a couple of times.No really, it was an outrageous amount of noise. I would imaging everyone on that side of the building (looking over toward the Irish Pub) would experience that din every morning.I don't think I have ever been to a downtown hotel that hasn't at least tried something in the way of noise reduction. I woke up at 4 am most of the nights I was there, and the noise kept up for long enough that I couldn't really get back to sleep.San Francisco is a great city and the people are wonderful, but the noise from that room was an enduring memory, and if they want my patronage again, they'll double glaze those windows."
237,2202,Sep 1 2003	Wonderful hotel	Stayed mid aug '03 for 4 nights. We got a great corner room no 501. Biggest room we stayed in during our 2 week california tour. Staff very friendly and helpful and location right on Poweell by two cable lines. It can be alittle noisy but that's what you'd expect in the middle of a city not that we noticed after touring the city's infamous hills. For good Britich style pub food tryp Johnny fowley's around the corner.

1,2203,"Nov 25 2009 	Stay somewhere else!	Not only is this hotel ridiculously hard to find, once we got there I burst into tears. The rooms are cramped and run down. The bathroom is old and gross. Pealing caulking and slippery floors along with poor housekeeping make this hotel anything but pleasant! The first thing that hit me in the face when we walked in was the overwhelming stench! It smelled of horrible perfume and it never went away even after leaving the window open for 2 days straight. The bed was super firm and way uncomfortable. English is clearly the 2nd language of all the employees and expect to pay $40 a day to park your car...DO NOT STAY HERE! Motel 6 would be a welcome repreave from this crap hole!"
2,2203,"Nov 24 2009 	Great location very comfortable and inviting - a perfect stay!	From the moment we arrived at the Warwick we were warmly welcomed by the doormen and the reception staff. The hospitality was superb and we felt right at home in this hotel. The room was very nice, beds were comfortable, room was very clean and spacious. The location was superb, right in the heart of San Francisco, two blocks back from Union Square. We had a front room but didn't experience any excessive noise from the street below. When we return to San Franciso we'll definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to our family and friends."
3,2203,"Nov 23 2009 	Wonderful anniversary	We did enjoy the romantic Warwick Hotel perfectly located downtown San Francisco on our 7th year anniversary night. We walked everywhere we needed to go. Staff was very nice, they even had a bottle of wine waiting for us when we got into our room. :-)We do recommend this hotel to those who are celebrating a special day and to tourists visiting our beautiful city.Ed and Nese"
4,2203,"Nov 18 2009 	Charming Hotel for Leisure Travel Needs Maintenance	Hotel is very charming. Rooms are small (welcome to San Fran!), but comfortable and a GREAT location! Set up more for leisure travelers than business travelers. Cell signal from room is incredibly weak, as well as wireless internet signal strength. Call for your car well in advance of when you need it (30 min vs the 15-20 advised by the front desk). Bathroom could use a bit of maintenance - white caulk around the window in the shower is mostly black from mold, which is pretty disgusting and would be easy to fix!"
5,2203,"Nov 18 2009 	Wonderful experience right in the heart of things	Stayed for 8 days with family for a wedding and extended trip. We could not have been more pleased with the Warwick. Staff is fantastic and the restaurant is a great place to start the day with very reasonable breakfasts perfectly done every time. Stopped into the Fairmont and a few big names around Union Square, and am thankful we avoided all that hectic, over-priced glitz for the warmth and charm of the Warwick. Can't beat the location, either."
6,2203,"Nov 17 2009 	Warwick old-fashioned charm 	Early check-in permitted, laid-back yet responsive staff. Room was a little worn as it is not a modern property, sink did not fit in bathroom so was located amongst bedroom by door. Comfortable bed &amp; good plasma tv &amp; stations available. Good service, cleanliness. Decent location, up from Union Square. I would stay there again."
7,2203,"Nov 16 2009 	Wish I had the same good experience as the other reviewers!	My boyfriend and I spent this past weekend in one of the deluxe suites and it had two restrooms. The guy that checked us in was actually really nice and gave us a free upgrade. I was originally really excited because of the reviews and the decor of the rooms I saw online. Location was great. Our room was pretty big though because it was the suite. The rooms look like they do in the pictures but the furniture is actually really really old - antique style. Its got some character to it, but the room smelled literally like an antique store and borderline almost like a thrift shop. But the real why I gave this place one star was because we literally had one of the worst night sleep there. Unlike the other reviews I read, our bed was just awful. I can't really describe it, but we were both tossing and turning the whole night and woke up just miserable. It didn't help that there was a popular and very nosiy bar across the street, but if you closed the windows, the noise isn't too bad. It might get stuffy though because there is no a/c and the fan makes a squeaky noise. The pillows (the ones you actually sleep on with the white covers NOT the decorative ones) were just flat as if they have been there for years. We visit SF quite often and stayed at various hotels in the city. This is by far the worst...I was so disappointed. Such a pity since Warwick has hotels all over the world...I expected more from them. Never again. Not even Motel 6 is this bad. When we mentioned the bed to the front desk lady at check out, she didn't even bother to inquire about what was wrong with it. Simply said &quot;sorry to hear that.&quot;"
8,2203,Nov 12 2009 	Quaint and central	The rooms are quaint and cosy but very clean. The staff are very helpful nothing is too much trouble. It is very near Union Square so is convenient for transport the theatre and the Piers
9,2203,"Nov 7 2009 	San Francisco	Quaint, small cozy rooms with little extras like ornate bathroom fixtures"
10,2203,Nov 1 2009 	great staff	The Warwick &quot;Front Suite&quot; was perfect for the three of us. The staff was friendly and eager to please. The location was perfect and safe for myself and two teenaged girls. It was clean and a great value. Will stay again!
11,2203,"Oct 30 2009 	Cute quaint cozy sums it up!	I recently stayed at the Warwick near Union Square in the heart of San Francisco. I have stayed in several hotels in this area and found this one to be the most delightful. It's decor was fashionable with a King Louis motif. I enjoyed the lobby atmosphere with it's comfy furnishings. My room was extremely warm and welcoming. Again, the decor had an antique flavor but the bathroom fixtures were up to date and quite functional. I will choose this hotel in the future when I am in San Francisco. The Warwick has moved to the top of my list in value, comfort, and style. The staff was absolutely outstanding, as well."
12,2203,"Oct 28 2009 	Short list this one..	The Warwick is situated conveniently to Union Sq- just about 5 mins walk. The foyer looked smaller in real life than I had seen in pics but was welcoming and the staff friendly and helpful. My room was a nice size and clean but the furnishings look a little...tired lets say. It IS a noisy spot on the corner of Geary and Taylor so if u are a light sleeper ask for a room at the back. I was woken by a noisy group of 'ladies'in the street one night.But hey...we ARE in town here...there is bound to be noise.A few minutes walk past Union Sq and Macy's will take u on to the Westfield Mall, other shops, BART train system etc. You'll also come across the tram turnaround point.Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was enjoyable and the waitress never without a smile there. There are plenty of eating places within a few mins walk of the hotel.Overall it was a good experience and I'd certainly contemplate staying there again if I wanted to be close to Union Sq."
13,2203,"Oct 12 2009 	Good location nice staff adequate accomodations overall good value.	Upon arrival, we received our oversized keys (yes, they still use metal keys not key cards) and were off to our 5th floor room. The elevator looked quite new, but when we got to our floor, we had to go back down about 5 steps to get to our room. Upon entering our room, I could hear a loud fan-like sound and was hoping it wasn't the air conditioner making that noise, but was quickly both relieved and disappointed at what I saw; It was an industrial fan used for drying floors, which meant that our room was not ready made evident by most of the furniture being on the bed, requiring a trip back up 5 steps and down via the elevator to the front desk. The guy manning the desk promptly set us up in another room on the 2nd floor. When we got there we realized that it had only one bathroom -we were supposed to have two, having reserved a &quot;junior suite&quot;. So, back down we went with our suitcases and carry-ons. This time we had to tell the FD guy that we were supposed to get a &quot;junior suite&quot; and found out that he gave us a &quot;mini suite&quot;. We really didn't want to stay on the 2nd floor anyway -too close to the street and all the noise since Geary is a busy street. So we got our JS, where else, but back on the 5th down the steps next to our first room, but facing the alley instead of the street. Another FD guy who accompanied us to our (third) room warned us of the garbage truck which he said would come at 3:00 in the a.m., but actually came between 6:00 and 7:30 a.m. daily. It wasn't too bad because we were going to awaken about that time anyway. Aside from that little fiasco, the jr. suite -which is actually 1 room with a queen-sized bed and full bathroom adjoining another room with a pull-out sofa-bed and a full bathroom (with a shower stall) connected by double french doors was adequate. This set-up was a little larger than the mini-suite although it didn't have a balcony, only windows overlooking an alley (which had a hostel at the end of it which made it a little noisy late at night). The room was quite clean (although there was a slight smokey smell as it was a smoking room, although we requested a non), but the furniture was a little worn with scuffs, scratches, and stains on the couch. Coming in handy was a computer with internet access which was connected to a printer at the front desk (which was steps away), as in-room wifi is not free. The hotel's restaurant, La Scene, is quite nice and offers continental breakfast, brunch (on certain days), and dinner. We only had dinner there and it was surprisingly quite good. It was also a great value since we had the pre fixe menu which, for $28, included three courses which had two choices each. My fiance opted to upgrade to the $38 pre-fixe which allowed you the choice of any menu item from the pre-set categories -salad, main course, and dessert. Overall, it was a pretty good hotel with a friendly staff, above-average though modest rooms, providing good value and location (two blocks from Powell St. cable car line, and about four blocks from Market St. which has bus/F-line/Bart access, and the Westfield shopping center). It also had a lot of dining choices nearby with anything from fast food (Jack In The Box) to pizza to sushi to diner food to casual and fine dining.I would recommend getting a multi-day Muni pass which allows you unlimited rides on the bus, cable cars, and F-line which runs along Market St. to the Piers. I would also recommend dining at the Westfield shopping center on Market St. There is a food court that offers your typical fast -food fare AND in a separate section there are restaurants that are more upscale, serving their food on ceramic-looking plastic plates, metal utensils and glasses for water. The food was quite good offering American, ethnic, and dessert eateries. Also, if you rent a car, there is a parking garage on the corner of Mason and O'Farrell which charges only $15/ night if you're in after 5:30pm and out before 9:30 am (no in-out though), beats coughing-up $35/day at the hotel."
14,2203,"Oct 8 2009 	Small Friendly nicely kept Hotel in the heart of the action.	The Warwick Hotel is a small hotel located in Union Square, across the street from the Curran Theater and ACT. Because of it's small size, it has a very personal feel with the staff providing personal attention. Typically there was more than one staff member immediately available for any needs in the lobby and when calling from our room, the desk would answer nearly immediately. I was surprised at how friendly everyone was since this is the big city and expected the cold shoulder. This was a big plus as travelling to the big city with small children can be a bit scary when you're used to small town living.The room was on the smaller side from what we are used to but since we had a suite, we had enough room for the 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 children. The rooms are nicely furnished and very very clean, although some of the plumbing fixtures are a bit worn, such as faucets that don't turn off easily. Our room was on the street side, so we overlooked Geary Blvd, but traffic noise was not a problem, so the building insulation must be good.The location of this hotel is incredible if you want to be near the action. Walk out of the hotel and across the street and you are at two of the best Theaters in town, the Curran and ACT. Walk 2 blocks down and you're in the heart of Union Square for all the shopping your wallet can manage, or you can pick up a cable car going down Powell street that takes you to a few blocks from Chinatown. Market Street is also about 2 or 3 blocks away.The one thing we liked least about our stay was the homeless people who are on every corner in this part of town. Small town life shields you from the harsh reality of the many many people who are destitute in the richest country in the world."
15,2203,"Oct 5 2009 	Fantastic	This is a great place to stay. Excellent location, and friendly staff. The rooms are charming. Great service...."
16,2203,"Sep 21 2009 	Boutique atmosphere friendly helpful staff and great location.	The Warwick San Francisco was an unexpected treat. I've stayed in Warwick hotels before and always enjoy them because of their oldword, boutique charm, upscale furnishings, professional and cordial staff, and attention to detail. I was also very happy with the price and location. The hotel is nicely decorated in a 19th century motif, but bright and cheerful, not dark. The rooms, though a bit small for more modern hotels were beutifully appointed with period antique headboard and wardrobe, and other period replica furniture and fixtures. The bathroom was marble tiled and gold plated fixtures. I didn't use the room service (too much good food in San Francisco to stay in) but the menu was reasonably priced and had a nice selection, especially breakfast. Location was very nice. I was attending the ICAAC convention at the Marconi Convention Center, and after seeing how close I was after the first day's cab ride, I make the walk then next few days - usually about 10 minutes. China town is only a 10-15 minute walk, and Union Square is literally just around the corner. You can walk about 2 blocks and catch the Powell Street cable car to Fisherman's wharf.The staff was WONDERFUL. I especially appreciated the attention the front desk person, Mounia, took to recommend places for me to see, and how to get around on the public transportation. I was able to save on cab rides by taking buses, trolleys, the MUNI and the BART. I will definitely plan to stay at the Warwick SF again. I do recommend the suites if you plan to have any of your business associates stop by, or if you have two or three in your party. 19th century hotel rooms were not nearly as spacious as rooms today, so the little extra for a suite is worth it if you're going to conduct any meetings or gatherings in your rooms. PS - Try the restaurant downstairs, they have an excellent menu and reasonable prices."
17,2203,"Sep 20 2009 	Fabulous	This hotel is elegant. The room was a little small, but very nice. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful with directions and maps. The location is very convenient to transportation and tourist attractions. Will definetly stay there again."
18,2203,Sep 7 2009 	Warrick Hotel	The Room was clean and tidy will all mod cons. The room was small but suited as not much time was spent in the room apart from sleep. 1 1/2 blocks from union square and public transport. 10mins walk to the main shopping cenre.
19,2203,"Aug 25 2009 	Good Hotel for the Price	Had a good stay here for two nights. The room was clean and staff friendly. Valet parking is a little bit pricey, and a google search should show better deals close by. Would stay again."
20,2203,"Aug 24 2009 	A perfect stay a perfect location	The Warwick Regis is our favorite SFO hotel - for leisure or business travel. This time we were in town for a conference and we passed on the conference hotel (too large and too impersonal) and instead booked our stay at the Warwick Regis. Its location is convenient - the conference hotel was just a block away, BART and the cable car lines a few blocks further. You're able to walk through the neighborhood and check out local restaurants (like Cafe Mason and Katana-ya). But the best part is the charm of the hotel. The room was beautifully appointed, the staff friendly and accessible. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but promised ourselves that we'd check it out the next time."
21,2203,Aug 15 2009 	This is my favorite hotel in San Francisco	I have staye dhere many times and never been disappointed. It is convenient and teh staff treats you well. It is quiet and provides everything you need in a boutique hotel.
22,2203,"Aug 4 2009 	would have been ok if the sheets had been clean	The first night I got to the Warwick, I climbed into bed only to find that there was a piece of crud already in there (I will spare you the details - trust me, it's gross). When I looked closer, I also saw some little hairs on the sheets. I suspect that the sheets were not changed after the last guest left, and I was really disgusted. The front desk staff sent someone to change my sheets when I asked, but he didn't bring a fitted sheet with him and asked me if I wanted the fitted sheet changed - as if there were some reason I would want to sleep on someone else's filthy sheet!Basically, the service was ok, but the hotel is not clean - I was disgusted staying there. Also, travelers should note that the hotel is on the corner of Union Square and the Tenderloin (which is not a safe or clean part of town)."
23,2203,"Aug 2 2009 	Warick Hotel Update	This is the second time I have stayed at the Warick and again it was as nice as ever. Rooms are small, large bed, desk with flat screen TV and a comfortable chair. Bath is nice, very clean, except for around the basin fixtures, they need a good cleaning. The staff is very friendly, always a smile and hello. Check in was quick and so was check out. Internet use is at a cost of $10.95 a day, but there is one free computer in the lobby. The location can't be beat, two blocks from Union Square, which means you won't here the clanging of the cable car bells as they move along Powell Street. The hotel is across the street from the Curran and Geary Theatres which offer live professional stage plays. The hotel does have a small bar, and dinning room with limited menu. In the afternoon complimentary coffee, tea and cookies are served in the lobby."
24,2203,"Jul 27 2009 	Our favorite San Fran hideaway - charming convenient excellent staff.	Don't pass this one by! A charming Victorian boutique hotel that's perfect for a romantic stay or a weekend getaway. Beautifully appointed rooms with traditional decor  comfortable beds. An easy walk to galleries, theaters, Macy's, Union Square, big name hotels and other downtown shopping destinations. They serve a lovely breakfast in the mornings and have a bar/restaurant on site. And if you want local flavor, visit one of 2 coffee shop within the same block (one is 24 hrs.) We have stayed her on many occasions and return with every trip to SF. This is the place to come if you're looking for something more than &quot;looks like the last place we stayed&quot;"
25,2203,Jul 21 2009 	very happy traveler	it was less then a mile from the Bart so i walked with a suitcase on wheels. the service was excellent and the windows worked well. Clean place! A junior suite is the way to go.
26,2203,"Jul 16 2009 	Convienent location.	We picked this hotel via Expedia due to its cost and location. The hotel staff were very friendly and quick to offer any assistance that we needed. Though the room was small on the small end, it was clean and comfortable"

The service is excellent and each member traveling with me felt special and wanted as if visiting family, Additionally, the room was beautiful--filled with tasteful antiques and charming accessories!We plan to return over and over!!!!"
28,2203,"Jul 6 2009 	Miserable Experience	Although the location was nice because it was in the middle of everything (despite the sirens that we heard all night), our suite left much to be desired. While we had two TVs in the suite, we soon found that one of the TVs was only a 13&quot; stored away in the armoire. Since no one could really watch that TV, we all had to pile on the bed in the bedroom to watch the other TV. I found hair in various places all over one of the bathrooms: two on the soap dish, one on the towel I used to dry my hands, one in the bathtub, one on the faucet of the bathtub, and two on the rim around the bathtub. After being grossed out by all the leftover hair, we found stains on two of our pillows, saw cobwebs all around, and the pull-out bed was falling apart. With all these issues, we ended our stay at the Warwick and checked the next morning."
29,2203,"Jun 24 2009 	Excellent Boutique Hotel Great Location 	This Hotel is a great little Boutique Hotel with classic European style, and friendly, courtious service. My room was not very large, but had nice details and was very clean. The Hotel is well located just a couple of short blocks off of Union Square, with plenty of good restaurants and bars right nearby. I was able to easily walk to the Convention Center, and BART train station. I stayed at this Hotel a couple of years ago and experienced equally great accomondations and service. I highly recommend."
30,2203,"Jun 20 2009 	Don't leave your car in the hotel's parking	I stayed for my night on June 16, 2009. I paid more than $30 for a night parking in the hotel's valet parking at Toca Park. When I checked out, I found that my GPS was stolen. The Hotel manager put me in contact with the Toca Parking manager, then washed his hands of me. The parking manager basically called me a liar.The hotel itself was OK, though very noisy.I'll never visit this Hotel, nor use any valet parking again."
31,2203,"Jun 16 2009 	Superb Service and Location!	My husband and I just stayed for 2 nights at the Warwick Hotel SFO. We received excellent service, speedy check-in to our streetside room. It had the BEST ever silent windows, ceiling fan and was nicely decorated in Victorian Theme, LOTS of storage...just perfect choice for a &quot;Non-bignamed Brand&quot; The bell desk, maid service, bar staff...all we contacted were fantastic. I filled out an online review, stated that the baseboard in the bathroom had some water damage, and received a personal reply from the General Manager that it's being repaired now. We would select the Warwick again."
32,2203,Jun 3 2009 	the service is great: timely thoughtful and truly hospitable	The Warwick is tucked a block behind the once grand San Francis. This was our second stay there--and the Warwick will certainly be our first choice next time we are in SFO! The rooms are compact but very well laid out and comfortable. I cannot think of a better value for the location and the service--which is unfailingly offered with a smile!
33,2203,"Jun 1 2009 	Location location location	We had a Junior Deluxe Suite here for three nights. Only complaint we had was the check-in lady who at first didn't want me to pay in advance then wanted to over-charge me for room security deposit. The wonderful Rudy got it all sorted with lots of smiles, and free drink vouchers for the bar! Hotel room was great, couldn't have had a better room, clean and comfortable. Street noise not really a problem, one is in the middle of a busy city so one must expect some noise! The bar/restaurant staff very pleasant and obliging. Laundry service prompt and efficient, same day service. Great deli next door for breakfast or takeaway sandwiches. Authentic Mexican restaurant, pizza joint, Starbucks all 2min walk from hotel. Location was great, suitable for catching cabs, hire cars, buses, short walk to cable cars/trolleys/Union Square. We had absolutely no problem getting around SF from our hotel and the great map hotel provided! Some reviewers have complained re street people/beggars; they did not bother us. The hotel staff advise guests which blocks not to walk down etc. There were beggars down Geary Str but they didn't bother us once we told them NO. Every city has beggars, SF being no different. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is wanting a warm welcome, comfortable beds and rooms, good food, olde worldy deco and location location location!!"
34,2203,"Jun 1 2009 	Top Class!!	Great location, great staff and a great stay. Will stay here again next time in San Francisco!!"
35,2203,"May 17 2009 	Excellent location friendly helpful stuff	We stayed a few nights on April 22. I liked the hotel including its location, its retro room decorations. We found the people there very polite, friendly and extremely helpful with most of the questions we had. Room and bathroom very clean and house keeping done very well. I would definitely go back.Some people complained about noise around the hotel: it is true the area is a bit noisy in the morning as the city wakes up but you are in downtown San Francisco, few blocks or less then 10 min walks from Union Square. It is a vey good and convenient location for travelers. Also keep in mind parking in San Francisco is very expansive ( 25  40$ per 24 hours). The hotel offer valet parking only (forgot the price but somewhere around $30 per day). There are several parking places around the hotel that you can check out (when we were there one offered $15 after 5 pm as long as you take the car out before 9 am next day). The reality is that you do not really need a car in San Francisco. If parking and noise are your primary concerns when booking the hotel then may advise for some other places towards the edge of the city or surrounding area but close to one of the bus main routes or the main metro line.The rating I provided for the hotel does not take in consideration are noise and parking since we did not have a car and we did sleep well at night (after walking through the city all day and also having some ear plug, we would have probably slept even if a construction project would have taken place below our window)."
36,2203,"May 16 2009 	Everything we needed.	Loved everything about this hotel. From the check in to check out-everything was perfect. The staff was very warm and friendly. The staff of the restaurant was exceptionally pleasant and professional. We had a suite-on the 7th floor as I requested. We asked for a room off of Geary-this seemed to be much quieter. There was a bit of noise from the Hostel in the alley-but it ended early. When you are in the heart of the city you have to expect a certain amount of noise. We had absolutely NO noise from within the hotel. We did not hear plumbing, other guests etc. I felt that the staff was very well trained. We were always greeted and made to feel welcome. All of our requests were handled quickly and completely. I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the area."
37,2203,"Mar 31 2009 	SOOOO Loud!	We stayed at the Warwick with our children for two nights. We were able to book our trip via priceline.com so the rate was reasonable but we later found out that the rooms were single queen beds only so we had to upgrade to a suite to accomidate our children. We were on the third floor. I found the room very claustrophobic and stuffy. We did open the two small windows at the end of the room but the street noise was unbearable. There were people yelling, skateboarding, sirens, and partiers. We have traveled all over the world and I have never stayed in a room that was so noisy. Normally if i think the noise will be a problem, I just turn on the bathroom fan or request a box fan. The hotel had neither. The location of this hotel is good and the rooms are sufficient but if you want a decent nights sleep, I suggest you go elsewhere. Also note that the only parking for miles from this location is only available in a garage at minimum $30/night plus the 25% tax and mark-up for any vehicle other than a car. Please consider this when comparing this hotel with others on the wharf that provide parking."
38,2203,"Mar 20 2009 	Absolutely Romantic Unique and Spectacular	We booked this hotel from Canada, hoping to have a truly unique stay in the beautiful city of San Francisco. Well, the Warwick Regis didn't disappoint! From the moment we drove up to the front entrance, and the Valet/Porters helped us unload our luggage, parked our car, and escorted us inside, we knew we were making some marvellous memories! Check in was a breeze, in fact, since the hotel was full to capacity with a number of conferences going on in the city, we were upgraded from a regular room to one of the Deluxe Junior Suites! This charming suite featured locking French doors separating the bedroom from the parlor, a full Italian marble bathroom in the bedroom, as well as, a full bath in the parlor room with a stand-up shower. We had a crown-canopied queen sized bed in the master bedroom, and the parlor had a queen-sized sofa pullout (not that we needed it). Our 418 sq. feet suite had two separate entrances, two dual-line telephones, a guest safe, hairdryers, monogrammed robes and umbrellas. We consider Warwick Regis a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel, with rooms that are furnished with hand-carved headboards, antique armoires and a writing table. Very elegant, traditional and Euro-classic in style, in the style of Louis XVI. We felt as though we had stepped back in time, in history, to the golden era of San Francisco... with all the comforts of the 21st Century!We didn't use the 24-hour Room Service or the high-speed wireless, but we really appreciated the twice-daily housekeeping, overnight shoeshine service, the complimentary daily newspaper, the valet service and valet parking. We also enjoyed the complimentary afternoon tea, coffee and cookies in the lobby area available to all hotel guests. &quot;La Scene Caf and Bar&quot; right on the premises, was handy as well as enjoyable, for lovely continental breakfasts! Terrific service! Our coffee cup was well attended!But what was it that we really &quot;loved&quot; about the Warwick Regis? Location, location, location!!! We were just minutes from from Union Square, and just around the corner was the Powell Market turntable that is the beginning of the Powell-Hyde (and the the Powell-Mason) Cable Car line . We either walked or took Cable cars wherever we went... Lombard Street, Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39, we took an Alcatraz Island Boat Tour and then had a fabulous meal at Neptunes' on Pier 39. When we wanted to drive out the next day, the Valet Parking was very handy to get our car out front. We went out to the Golden Gate Bridge, the Presidio and the Golden Gate Park to tour the Japanese Tea Garden. At the end of the day, Cliff House, with its variety of fresh local ingredients and abundant seafood, was our choice for a romantic dinner, spectacular panoramic ocean views and our final Californian sunset. If you are looking for somewhere truly unique, for memories that you will treasure forever, then you must take them to San Francisco's Warwick Regis."
39,2203,"Feb 3 2009 	Quite nice	The hotel is in a good location, close to Union Square and everything else you would like to see. The staff are very friendly and helpful.The room I was in was a bit small, but it's fine for a single traveler except that there was not much room to put my luggage. I'm not fussed about that. My room was on the first floor just above the reception and like some other review said, yes it was kinda noisy because it was facing the road with restaurants, pubs, and the theatre, but the noise dies down later in the night. Just make sure you draw your curtains when you are changing!"
40,2203,"Jan 27 2009 	Why Rated so Low	I was nervous after reading so many mixed and bad reviews of this hotel but I stayed here anyway because of the price. I was so happy I did because I found it to be a very charming hotel in an excellent location just a couple of blocks west of Union Square. The staff was very nice, the room was clean and a decent size and the breakfast at the cafe next door was very good and more than enough food.For a really good meal without going to far, try Colibri on the same block as the hotel. They have wonderful Mexican food but be sure to make reservations as they are always packed.In an expensive city like San Francisco, the Hotel Regis is a great choice without breaking the bank."
41,2203,"Jan 20 2009 	Great Classy Hotel	I am a professional tour guide who owned part of an Italian travel agency. I live and work in San Francisco: I believe I know the city as well as anyone. It never ceases to amaze me the petty things that people point out in these reviews. Let me tell you, honestly, about the Warwick. The location is superb: two blocks from Union Square, in the Theater District, across from the American Conservatory Theater. The hotel rooms are not huge, but they are ample and as tastefully decorated as can be. People who call them &quot;old and outdated&quot; have never been to Europe: the level of detail, old world styling -- beautiful furninshings, bedding, and decorations -- is amazing. I read some reviews complaining about the price: newsflash. If you go in high season, without shopping for details on expedia.com, or cheapthotels.com, etc, you are going to pay a premium. A $250 room in August can be had for $99 or $129 in November, or during a weekday. The Warwick is beautiful: great rooms, great ambience, a cool bar -- La Scene -- downstairs, and one of the greatest neighborhoods in San Francisco. You're close to everything: Union Square, shopping, North Beach, the Ferry Building. If your idea of a great hotel is high tech, chrome, sparse, hip, this is not your place. If posh, stylish, old world elegeance, with class and comfort suit your style, there is not a better hotel in San Francisco. The bathroom may be small, but it's beautiful. I love the Warwick: it's where I stay when I want a romantic night with my wife..."
42,2203,"Dec 9 2008 	Looks better on the website	Decoration is very dated, rooms are small and not quite comfortable. Bathroom is small, and the wash basin is in the room. Rooms facing the Geary Street are noisy (avoid them if you can). Reception is ok. Breakfast was minimal. Meeting rooms are in the basement, and are not particularly trendy. Minibar was a joke, and I did not feel safe drinking the juice in the minibar. Positive side is the central location."
43,2203,"Nov 4 2008 	Pretty but small	This hotel looked beautiful from the images online, rooms spacious and elegant.In person, it was old and warn down. Our room was a suite with two bathrooms. For a family of four, it felt cramped. Our view was of an ugly alley, you could actually smell the garbage.The employees were not helpful and not very knowledgeable of things to see or do in the city, or even how to get anywhere. They were able to access the internet to find directions for us, but my husband had to help them with that as well.The restaurant in the hotel was just okay, while they acted as though it was 5 star, they had snobby attitudes(not kid friendly), the food was marginal at best.Having said all that, we had one of our best trips with our children yet! SF has so much to offer. It was fleet week when we were there and it was amazing. We took the ferry(reservations necessary) over to Alcatraz and watched the Blue Angels air show from The Rock, unbelievable.Lots, of walking, our kids have lots of energy so this was not a problem, a stroller would not be so fun.The zoo was great! The exhibits are set up so you can really see the animals close up.Louie's restaurant next to the Cliff house is a must, good hearty breakfast, nothing fancy, but the view is unmatched. The Cliff house has been redone, we did not eat there, looked more upscale, again with an amazing view.We had a great time, just wouldn't go back to that hotel again."
44,2203,"Oct 18 2008 	Old world elegance	The hotel is even prettier than the photos I saw when booking. It's a pure boutique hotel with classic decoration: antique chandelier, armchairs, granite counter top... I love the quiet elegance of the building and the staff is so friendly. Love to come back there one day!"
45,2203,"Oct 13 2008 	A Great Boutique Hotel near Union Square	My wife and I, along with another couple stayed at the Warwick Hotel on October 5th for one night. It is a great small hotel near Union Square. Our rooms (604 &amp; 704) were very nice. Even though our rooms were on Geary Ave, we did not experience any noise from the traffic. Staff is friendly and very helpful in giving us directions."
46,2203,"Oct 12 2008 	Great Location	We have just had 2 and a half weeks around California with 4 adults.This was the most expensive hotel we stayed in and probably the smallest room ,given it was a junior suite but we enjoyed the stay.The staff were pleasant and the free internet was welcome.The location was superb and we were not worried by excessive street noise.For that time of the year San Fran was very warm and having no air-con was a problem.Overall it was ok"
47,2203,"Oct 7 2008 	Good stay - Great location	We did not really know what to expect when we &quot;won&quot; this room through Hotwire, certainly after reading some negative reviews here.However, we had a good stay. Sure, the room isn't that big, but it was nicely decorated and had everything you need. Moreover, rooms are very clean. We stayed at the back of the hotel, and had a very quiet room (on the third floor). It had a more cosy atmosphere than most larger hotels, wich we liked.The location is great, 2 blocks from Union Square, cable car stops and BART. I also read in some reviews that you have a lot of homeless people surrounding the hotel. We found that more a problem of the whole city, not the neighbourhood."
48,2203,"Oct 5 2008 	Perfect Location!	The Warwick is an older and smaller hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and a good size compared to other hotel rooms in San Francisco. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning system, but not a problem as long as you dont go during a heatwave. Our toilet leaked a bit, but we figured out that all we needed to do was jiggle the handle. the weahter forecast was left on the bed each noght with some chocolates during the turndown service which I considered to be a nice touch. Staff was friendly and courteous, always eager to answer a question or engage in conversation if you had the time. Price was great. Walgreens accross the street was super convenient. We tried finding cheaper parking in the area, but other garages seemed a bit shady, especially when you can smell alcohol on the attendents breath. So we decided to go with the valet parking at the hotel for $35 a day with in and out priveledges. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to the beginning of the cable car line at powell and market st in just a few minutes (5 blocks). I recommend starting there, otherwise you might get passed up at other cable car stops because there is simply no room for you. There is also a subway at that same intersection. Buy a muni pass!. you can use almost every kind of transportation at leisure for unlimited rides. there are other tour busses that charge an arm and a leg to drop you off at all the tourist spots. with a muni pass, all you need is a map of the city to see what lines you need to catch. Super convenient for out trips to fishermans wharf and the ball park. We skipped the transportation for our trips to Yerba Buena Gardens, union square and chinatown. It was a nice stroll through the city. by the end of our trip my husband, 4 year old and I were all sad to leave. the location and price of this hotel really made out trip."
49,2203,"Oct 1 2008 	Great Staff! Great Value!	I was traveling with family. I booked three rooms for three nights. All three rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and the staff was wonderful. I was concerned because of some of the negative reviews - but was happily surprised with how nice the hotel is. It is very small, but in a great location on Geary Street. The rooms were small, but last year I stayed across the street and paid twice as much for the same size room. There is no air conditioning and we were on the 2nd floor - leaving the windows open for fresh air caused it to be a little noisy at night. We left just the bathroom window open and it was fine. Each room had a ceiling fan - which kept it very comfortable and even a bit too cool one night. The beds were comfortable, but seemed a little smaller than a queen -- if you are used to a large king bed or need a large room, this isn't the place for you. It is an old beautiful hotel with large wooden moldings, large old fashioned brass keys (no digital door locks here). Large dark wood furniture but a modern flat screen TV with pay per view. There was one PC in the lobby for guest use (no charge) - with no charge for printouts - which is unusual. Sometimes there was a line, but it was free - so its hard to complain, right? I had an emergency and needed to be able to send and recieve a fax at 1 a.m. - the front desk staff jumped right on it and helped me out with no complaints - it was great customer service. (No charge for my faxes either.) When we called for ice, a bucket was delivered within minutes at no charge (except for the tip.) There is a safe in the room and the honor bar fridge was only half full so we were able to keep soda and beer in it without a problem without any extra charges. We asked for an iron and one was delivered. There was a hair dryer in one of the drawers. There isn't a closet. But there was an armoir and a lot of drawer space. There is a cable car stop about two blocks away. Decent (not great) pizza two or three stores down. There is a drugstore about 40 feet from the front door, as is a liquor store for snacks, sodas, etc... All in all it was a great value. We paid $107 per night, per room (plus tax) on priceline... in San Fran I would have been comfortable paying up to $160 per night for this hotel and still felt it was a fair price. The best part was that there were no little hidden fees for faxes, pc use, printouts, ice, etc..."
50,2203,"Sep 4 2008 	Nice stay	Very convient place to stay. Room was small, but comfortable. Bathroom VERY small. The only &quot;closet&quot; in the room was an armoire, which had a broken hanging rod. The bellman said he would send someone to fix it. Two days later still not fixed. We had to hang our clothing on the coat hooks. Not very convenient.We did not eat in the hotel, but did have a drink in their small bar, which was pleasant. We did eat at a deli practically next door, which was very good, and a few doors down is a Mexican restaurant to die for.We arrived prior to the rest of our party. We were early for check-in. We had our luggage plus all the luggage for family joining us from England. Staff stored all our luggage eagerly.Two negatives: 1. we overheard the desk giving totally inacurate information to other guests asking directions, and 2. when we asked where we could find a Notary they hadn't a clue what we were talking about."
51,2203,"Sep 2 2008 	Pleasant surprise	Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Warwick Hotel in San Francisco. We booked the hotel on priceline - name your own price and were a little apprehensive after reading some reviews. Must say, our visit was very nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was typically small, very clean and comfortable. We were on the 7th floor and had no problem with noise from the street (with our window closed of course). We visit SF every year and have stayed at several more expensive hotels and found really very little difference between them and the Warwick. Would definitely stay there again."
52,2203,Sep 1 2008	Pleasant Stay	I booked through Hotwire as a 3.5 star. This led me to believe there was a fitness center...they will give you privileges off the hotel site. It is an excellent location for Union Square...easy hop to the cable cars and shopping. It would also be fairly convenient for a convention at the Moscone with a bit of a walk.The entire staff were great and helpful. The breakfast in the restaurant was good. I would give it a 3 star. I was given a room off of Geary on the 4th floor and it was reasonably quiet. The carpet was fairly worn and the remodel is aging but the room was clean and comfortable...a little small.
53,2203,"Jul 28 2008 	Just OK.....	The place looks better on their website than in person. The Warwick is a relatively small property in a great location on Geary in the heart of the Union Square area. Our room (a junior suite) was much smaller than I had expected (I would guess &lt;200 sq ft) with a tiny bathroom. Our room faced Geary and therefore to get any fresh air into the room it was necessary to open the sliding glass doors overlooking the street. The street noise is considerable, and goes well into the early morning hours - therefore if quiteness is a consideration, avoid the rooms facing Geary. Overall I would say this is a 3 star hotel in my book - the public spaces and hallways were well maintained, but the rooms (at least ours) look a little tired. And the bath was definitely 3 star material. So, great location, just so-so room, OK room rate ($200/night plus $35 for parking) - and noisy."
54,2203,"Jul 21 2008 	Perfect Place in Union Square!	During an anniversary trip starting out in San Francisco, my husband and I stayed at The Warwick for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip and then our last night before we left California. This hotel was absolutely perfect for a multitude of reasons.The location is great and 2 blocks from Union Square. It is also around the corner from a cable car station. However, many places of interest are in walking distance....just put on your walking shoes. The room was very clean and comfortable. Although it was on the smaller size, it is definitely more than adequate if you are in San Francisco to tour about and not stay in your hotel room the entire time. The staff at the Warwick is one of the best parts of this hotel. Everyone was so helpful in providing directions, hot spots within the area, and transportation recommendations. Jake, the concierge, was the highlight! He is fantastic and a great asset to this hotel. Our final night at the Warwick was a treat! Because it was our anniversary, the wonderful staff upgraded us to one of their large suites! There are only 2 in the entire hotel. Room 803 was our's for the night and it was fantastic. Not only was it HUGE but it had a great plasma tv over the fireplace and a spacious bathroom. It was also extremely quiet and the perfect end to a fantastic week.We had a wonderful time here and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone headed to the San Fran area."
55,2203,Jul 12 2008 	Great Location - Wonderful Staff	I was somewhat worried when I 'won' this Priceline hotel after reviewing some of the negative comments on travel advisor website. I am here to tell you that the Warwick is a LOVELY place to stay. We asked for twin beds once the room was booked and were not disappointed. The room &amp; bath was very clean and decorated beautifully. We were on the fifth floor and the only street noise was the occasional ambulance. At night it was very quiet and dark in our room. The furniture included a Chinese armoire that held extra pillows and robes. The bathroom was lined in black marble with golden brass fixtures that portrayed an earlier time. All very elegant. We stayed for 3 nights and the turndown service with chocolate was never missed. Housekeeping came with iron within minutes of request and back again to pick up right when finished. Very attentive. I left my pillow and housekeeper had it waiting at the desk when we came back through town days later. Please don't let the negative comments on travel advisor keep you from booking this hotel. It was a great deal on Priceline and I was very pleased with our stay.
56,2203,"Jun 22 2008 	Don't go to Warwick in San Francisco	Hotel rooms looked big and beautiful online. Rooms (we had a jr. suite) was actually very small. Fold out sofa bed had terrible mattresses. Heat wave forced us to need a fan but fan was in the guest area, not the main room. First room had no window fan so we had to buy one downtown. First room we were assigned had major plumbing leak develop and we asked to be moved to another room. Hotel personnel said she could only put us in a room with one double bed and there were 3 of us! She had no sympathy for our dilemna. Took the maint. dept to get someone else to see we HAD to be moved right away. Also, they advertise free complimentary coffee in lobby in the morning. In fact they only have it from 6am to 7am... hardly a time you want to get up and dressed when on vacation! They also tried to overcharge us for honor bar items. We go to San Francisco a great deal but would never stay there again, and will advise others not to as well."
57,2203,"Jun 20 2008 	overall very good	My husband and I stayed at the Warwick Regis for 4 nights as part of out honeymoon. The room was nice with a comfortable bed and cute antique decor. It was very small though as was the bathroom. The room and bathroom were clean but obviously very old. The front desk staff were all very helpful in directing us to places we should go in town and getting us a shuttle to the airport that was cheaper than a taxi. The hotel is a a great location within walking distance of Union Square shopping, theater district, and a little farther walk to North Beach and Chinatown. It is also very convenient to the transit systems. We ate breakfast one morning in the hotel restaurant and it was good but very overpriced for the amount and slow service. All in all we had a great stay and would stay at the Warwick Regis again."
58,2203,"May 26 2008 	Great stay	Just spent 2 nights here, had a wonderful time. Clean, neat room, very helpful staff, We found it to be in an excellent location in the theatre district. It was close to all the transit lines. The staff got us an airport shuttle took us to and from the airport within 1/2 hour. Look forward to a return trip and will stay at the Warwick."
59,2203,"May 11 2008 	Charming great location overpriced	I booked this hotel through the JavaOne conference web site for $175/night.The lobby is small and typical of the boutique genre. The folks at the front desk are friendly, and check-in was quick and pleasant. Although they were pretty sure the hotel was able to honor a government rate, they were unable to give one. They copied my ID and said they'd talk to management, but I never saw a discount appear on my bill.Upon entering the room, I was struck by how nice and charming it looked (really bad pictures taken with my phone enclosed).I received the Chronicle each morning, which I enjoyed.Other visitors complained of poor water pressure--mine was fine. My room was clean and there was no sign of mold (as another reviewer had said).Others complained of a poor or dodgy location. They're nuts. The hotel is in the heart of the theater and shopping district, it's walking distance from Chinatown, North Beach, the Civic Center, and the Moscone Convention Center (to which I walked each day for a week). Several great restaurants are located within a block. And dodgy? By their definition, the entire city is dodgy. The homeless are everywhere, not just here. Now, the Tenderloin is dodgy, but It's blocks away, but close enough that visitors should learn where it is. I've walked through it many times at midnight. (I was only on Market, but I still didn't like it.) My small complaints include squeaky plumbing and doors on the closet.I was disappointed that breakfast wasn't included.I also couldn't believe that the refrigerator was located at the head of the bed. I just unplugged it at night. The other problem with the refrigerator is that while I was given a key to it, there was no obvious place to use it. It appeared that the lock was covered with a disposable pull tab, but there weren't any directions on the key, nor the pull tab. Since it wasn't obvious how to open the refrigerator, and I didn't really need to open it (except to satisfy my curiosity on how it was stocked), I didn't want to risk breaking something.The traffic noise was loud, but I can't take any points away for this as a room on the second floor on Geary is going to be loud. Earplugs were sufficient to ensure a good nights sleep, however, and the bed was certainly comfortable. A room on the top floor should be much better, as well as a room in the back (although you'd probably give up the view).And finally, the room was way overpriced. I'd be comfortable paying $125 for the room (so the sub-$100 Priceline deals are great bargains)."
60,2203,"Mar 25 2008 	A good hotel	Stayed at The Warwick Regis at the beginning of Feb. This was our first time to San Fran and we were very pleased with the hotel. Yes, it was old fashioned, you were given a key for your room, not a card to swipe, but, this just added to the authenticity of our stay. Great Loacation and helpful staff. The room was perhaps a little small but adequate. The resturant was excellent. Would definately go again."
61,2203,"Feb 28 2008 	Terrible visit!!!	The shower had no pressure and water temp was cold or really hot, nothing in between. They gave us another room and we saw mold growing on the ceiling and walls. We would have checkout out early but we pre-paid for the rooms on hotel.com. They tried to charge us for the room change, and even fought with me about it when i check out....This place was a joke!"
62,2203,"Dec 8 2007	Charmingly Old Fashioned	We stayed at the Warwick-Regis Hotel for one night for $92 on Priceline. We liked the location in the theater district - it is walking distance to theaters and a lot of cute restaurants. I can recommend David's Delicatessen a few doors down for breakfast and, although I haven't been there, I have heard that Dottie's True Blue Cafe, about three blocks away, is very good. The line was too long so we didn't go there this time. The restaurant in the hotel, La Scene, was good also. The hotel is on a noisy street, but we were on the 7th floor and the room was very quiet. The doorman tried very hard to get us a cab but it was very difficult the night we were there and we ended up walking nine blocks to our party. Check-in was friendly and efficient and the room was small but quite nice. I don't have anything negative to say about the hotel, and we would definitely stay there again."
63,2203,"Oct 13 2007 	Disappointment from Reservations Manager.	My husband and I had gotten a great deal on Priceline at $80 per night for 5 nights. A couple of months before our scheduled arrival, I had called and told them it was our honeymoon and was told that there would be a complimentary upgrade upon arrival.We were really excited and upon check-in, (smooth check-in with Natasha - she is awesome, very friendly, helpful and upbeat) we were reconfirmed that we had a complimentary upgrade. The guy who worked with Natasha that night was really good too.Rooms: We got a junior queen suite. Very pretty and old-fashioned. Turn-down service was great our whole stay. The room wasn't huge. It would be about a standard room say, in a Hilton hotel. The bed was comfortable but a little hard though.Bathroom(s): We had 2 good-sized Bathrooms. One with a tub, and the other just a shower. Water pressure was really, really good.Restaurant: We wanted to have breakfast there but the continental breakfast looked so unappetizing, we decided to skip it. Dinner however, was amazing. We went back twice for the Risotto. The guy who served us on Tuesday, Oct 9th was really good. (I'm sorry we forgot his name but we remember he is from New Jersey).On the day of our check out, we were told that there was a problem in the system and that we had to pay for our upgrade. The lady helping us out was really sweet and was trying her best to speed things up. They had the reservations manager - Kristen Bowman - come upstairs. She was aware that it was our honeymoon and because she thought that we were trying to check-in, she actually suggested that we DOWNGRADE our room if we didn't want to pay the balance - Great suggestion, huh? She was absolutely unaccommodating, cold and unfriendly about the whole situation. My husband and I actually apologized if there were any misunderstanding on our end when we had called the hotel before but she just said that she couldn't do anything about it, did not apologize, and left the situation to the front desk manager and walked away. Is that how a reservations' manager should deal with a situation? You guys decide.Now, the front-desk manager was really helpful, apologetic and sincere in helping us. He couldn't waive the extra charges (which we didn't care at this point) but he did offer us a slight discount which we appreciated. All in all, it was a comfortable stay with great service from the staff. But given the attitude from the reservations manager and the probability that we may have to deal with her again for our next reservation, we doubt we will ever stay at the Warwick Regis again."
64,2203,"Oct 11 2007 	Good time - not a great time.	We got this via Priceline and it was good value at $80USD per night for 4 nights. The room was quite small, but big enough for us, all we needed to do was sleep in it really. Very appealing decor, nice and old fashioned. Clean enough, and the turndown with a chocolate on the pillow was lovely.Front desk staff seemed a little uninterested - we were supposed to have 2 bathrobes in the room. There were none, so we told the staff &amp; 1 was sent up! We did not bother asking again. Also the free afternoon tea in the lobby was only coffee after the first day. We asked for tea &amp; the desk clerk said there is none. Apparently getting some more tea bags &amp; hot water was impossible! And stayed impossible for the next 3 days.Location was abit dodgy after dark, but was handy to everything - public transport, food, theatre etc. And we enjoyed seeing the fire engines go by regularly, sirens wailing."
65,2203,"Oct 3 2007 	Surprising Gaps	I stayed at this hotel while I was at a conference. The Union Square area in which it is located has many pan handlers but they are harmless although annoying. The hotel is in the theatre district and therefore very convenient if you want to see a show. Chinatown is only a few blocks away.This is a small, clean, boutique hotel with a French Baroque theme. The rooms are clean, quiet, small and charming. If you don't like using a real key to open your room, or hearing old plumbing pipes squeal, you shouldn't stay here. The housekeeping staff is very accommodating. They turn down your bed at night too.However, I was surprised at a few things. The internet rarely worked and no one on staff knew what to do about it or cared. I don't know whether they accommodate laptops in the rooms. You might want to look into that if you need a computer. Also, I had prepaid my bill. However, when I checked out they had no record of it. I was glad I kept a copy. Finally, they keep coffee in the lobby only until 7am. Then it is whisked away. So, you'd better get up early if you want to get a cup and sip it in your room and relax. There is always Starbuck's next door or room service, of course. I guess I have been spoiled with in-room coffee makers or a vat of coffee on tap in the lobbies of other hotels I have stayed at."
66,2203,"Sep 21 2007	Excellent hotel	We decided on a wednesday to spend the night on thursday in the city. We have a two year old and grandma was with us so we wanted a two room suite. Making the reservation was easy. When we got there they tld us they had upgraded us to an even bigger suite since we needed a crib, which they provided for free. The hotel wasn't hot or noisy as i read in previous comments. We have stayed in lots of hotels, including fancier one that dispointed us and the warwick was just the opposite. The main thing is that absolutely everyone who worked there was polite, helpful and so very nice in a genuine way. And i don't think yu could find a better deal for a suite, especially considering the extremely covenient location."
67,2203,"Sep 17 2007 	Great location - air conditioning NOT required~!	We are well seasoned Canadian travellers, age 48. Booked this hotel through the hotel website, after checking numerous review sites on the web. We LOVED this hotel and have no hesitation recommending it to others. Like a previous poster, we had the good fortune of visiting this beautiful city during a heat wave. Not having air conditioning was a non issue for us, and the lack of morning fog was a bonus! The overhead ceiling fan did a more than adequate job cooling our room. We had requested a top floor (7th) non smoking room on the &quot;back&quot; side of the building, and we had a lovely room. No view mind you, but we spent so little time in the room this was also a non issue. The bathroom was small but spotless, the bed very comfortable. The rooms are a bit small, but ample room for 2 adults and their luggage. The location is great for shopping and theatres, which we didn't do; and convenient to public transportation for sight seeing, which we did. A bit of an aerobic excercise walking up Nob Hill and over the top down to Fisherman's wharf, but well worth the effort. Slow down and admire the architechture and interesting sights both up and down the hills in every direction! Lots of restaurants and coffee shops in the area, we enjoyed Foley's Irish pub a couple of blocks away on O&quot;Farrell. The hotel's continental breakfast of coffee, juice, fresh fruit salad, croissants/pastries, yoghurt and cereal was more than adequate to fill us up and tide us over before take away crab cocktails at lunch! We hope to back for another stay at this gem of a hotel."
68,2203,"Sep 10 2007	Stay somewhere else if you can.	Overall, I felt that the Warwick was a fine hotel in a fine location with a couple of glaring exections. First, there was no airconditionining in the hotel. We happened to be in San Fran during a heat spell and were very uncomfortable. The other problem was the valet parking. We were told it was the best option for parking, so happily paid the $35. The next morning on our way to catch our flight, it took 45 minutes for them to retrieve our car. They let us know this was standard procedure, so be sure to factor this in if you stay here. No one told us in advance, and it made for a very stressful morning as we watched the minutes we had to check in at the airport tic away. The hotel isn't horrible, but the rates are comporable with other, much nicer hotels in the same area. Stay at those if you can and avoid the Warwick."
69,2203,"Sep 4 2007	Great Hotel!!! Location Size Atmosphere	I've read a few reviews on this hotel and want to start by saying, when you book a hotel in a busy downtown theater district, near 24 hour delis and at least one fast food restaurant... YOU SHOULD EXPECT THE NOISE OF THE CITY TO ENTER YOUR ROOM. I've read one too many people complain about the noise and that should not be held against the Warwick. The hotel is CLEAN, considering where it is located, essentially quiet. You are in walking distance to nearly every possible &quot;attraction&quot; as well as a variety of stores. A cab from the Warwick to almost every corner of San Fran costs under 15 bucks (and when I say corner I mean the far corners). Shorter cab rides, which will hit way more attractions run under 10 dollars. The hotel is just minutes away from the major subway station for both the BART and the MUNI. I believe we had chocolates placed in our room at least twice a day, and one day we really think they actually made up the room two times! The Warwick is just about the only hotel I would tell anyone to frequent in the San Fran area."
70,2203,"Aug 30 2007 	Great Experience!	My husband and I just returned from San Francisco. We booked our hotel through Priceline and stayed at the Warwick Regis. We had a great room on the 7th floor (we called ahead and requested a non-smoking room on the top floor). The room was lovely, more than enough room, quiet, and had a great shower! The front desk staff was always polite and helpful. A short two block walk and we were able to pick up the cable car to Fisherman's wharf, or walk five blocks to Market Street to access the BART or bus service. At the end of the day we walked into our room and soothing music was playing with the bed turned down and chocolates awaiting us on our pillows. We loved San Francisco and as far as our experience would recommend the Warwick Regis."
71,2203,"Aug 29 2007 	Charming Hotel - Good Location	Being in the travel industry for almost 20 years I have had the privledge of staying at many fine hotels and can be quite critical so I hope you find this review helpful.The Warwick Regis is a wonderful hotel. Built in 1913 it has retained a lot of it's old world charm. I believe I read that the chandelier came from Laura Ashley's mansion.The hotel sits at the corner of Geary and Taylor just two blocks from Union Square. As with many of the small boutique style hotels of San Francisco the Lobby is small but tastefully decorated.Check in was a breeze and the front desk staff were effecient and friendly. They were always there with a smile and eager to offer recommendations or suggestions.The room was a Jr. Suite which had a living room area and fireplace with a balcony(room 604) and faced out onto Geary. I had read the comments about other rooms being quite small and did peek into a few while staff were cleaning. They seemed fine and not overly small. The bed was quite comfortable and had no problems considering some comments on here saying the beds were rock hard. In general the room was in very good condition and decorated quite well. At least with my room you could tell some of the furniture had seen better days but only if you really looked closely most people probably wouldn't have noticed.One quirky little feature of the hotel was they use actual room keys and not card keys. Haven't seen those in years! But I thought it was a nice throw back to the yester years of travel. I hope they don't change over to card keys.It is true that most of the hotel rooms do not have AC or coffee makers. I did ask the front desk which rooms did have AC and I believe they said only the two executive suites have AC. But unless there is some heatwave in SFO you really don't need AC. As far as the in room coffee makers go it didn't bother me. I liked getting up and going down the street to StarBucks and getting my cup of joe in the morning. In room coffee is not the greatest anyway.Regarding the neighborhood and homeless and the message parlor behind the hotel. Like the management's previous response, San Francisco is an ecclectic city with diverse cultures. The area the hotel sits in is quite fine and not unusal at all to see message parlors or the many homeless pan handling but if your not use to it it can be a little unnerving.If you like me and like to have room service, I would skip this at the Warick. Most food is purchased from a local diner down the street a block and brought back to the hotel by staff. The food was mediocre and not worth the price.If you thinking about staying at this hotel and have found a good price(they do seem to be much lower than most hotels in the area) have no fears The Warwick Regis is a good place to stay!On my next trip back I would have no problems staying at this hotel again."
72,2203,"Aug 23 2007 	Worst experience We do not recommend this hotel!	First, the hotel management was somewhat rude to us upon arrival. We booked though priceline and requested one double or queen bed, for my husband and I. We were we placed in a room with two twin beds, and were told that since we booked through priceline that was &quot;the best available room.&quot; The hotel manager reluctantly changed our room to one with a queen size bed after we insisted. The room was small but comfortable. Our window faced the street so it was fairly noisy throughout the night and the location of the hotel is not too good. In addition, this hotel does not have stairwell access to guests, however their stairwell has NO sign to indicate this. I was on my way to a conference and took the stairs and immediately realized that it was not for guest use because it was dark and appeared under construction. When I attempted to go back to the main hallway the door behind me was locked. I attempted to exit through various floors and each door was locked. Panicked, I called the front desk to unlock the door for me, and was basically told to find my way. I ended up exiting through the kitchen! Needless to say, staying at this hotel was an awful experience. I would not recommend it!"
73,2203,"Aug 16 2007 	Loved This Place	This hotel was lovely! Our room was everything we expected with all requests met. Comfy bed, chairs etc. We were pleasantly surprised to find body wash for showering instead of just the usual bar of soap most places provide. Keep in mind that it's not out in the country so expect to hear the typical noises associated with city life. Parking is a non-issue since staff takes care of it; however there isn't a clear sign for their valet parking but all you have to do is just pull up to the front of the hotel, go inside,check in and leave the keys with the front desk. If you are staying on a sunday be aware that the on site restaurant isn't open. However, you can still get room service by calling the front desk and placing your order from a local cafe. The hotel staff takes care of everything. Very nice and great service all around. Starbucks is about three doors down. Walgreens across the street. Near theatres, galleries, restaurants etc. We would definatly stay here again."
74,2203,"Aug 2 2007 	Special Night at a Special Hotel	My husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary at the Warwick and we could not have picked a more romantic hotel. Our room was absolutely charming and clean with a canopy over the bed and a marble bathroom with brass hardware. It was decorated with antiques and beautiful draperies, wallpaper, and upholstery. There was a flat screen television located on a lovely antique desk, next to a beautiful antique armoire and two charming upholstered chairs.Being from Ohio, with humid, warm summers, we found there was no need for air conditioning in the cool San Francisco climate. Our room on an upper floor overlooked the street and the drug store, for a fine, if not, stellar view. For fresh air, we opened the windows and fell asleep to the city sounds and slept like babies on the comfortable bed.We needed only to walk a few blocks to get to the cable cars, which we used for transportation to Fishermans Wharf &amp; Chinatown after parking our car with the valet. The only negative was the $35 a day charge for parking our vehicle. At the time I had bid on the hotel, parking was $21 per day. However, a few months later, the fee had jumped to $35. Even with the parking fee, the Regis was still a bargain due to the great price I received on Priceline.The staff was friendly &amp; helpful. The desk clerk even helped us locate a budget hotel for our next night in San Francisco as we left. We will definitely return to the Warwick Regis on our next trip!"
75,2203,"Jul 31 2007	We do not recommend staying there.	We stayed in the Warwick Regis during our Honeymoon. Even though we had a guaranteed booking with late arrival, we could not get a room when we arrive late night. We were put into a provisional room with a provisional bed. The night was awful and we expected to be moved into a great room the next day. However we were put into a pretty standard smoking room while we are strictly non-smokers. Not a nice experience as well. Generally staff seems to be overstrained and not too helpful. We do not recommend staying there."
76,2203,"Jul 30 2007 	Good Hotel but Noisy	Nice old hotel in a great area. It is right across the street from the Clift hotel and very close to a theatre, so alot is happening. Because of this, bring your ear plugs. It is very noisy at night and expect to be woken up several times by people on the street. Overall, it was a good experience."
77,2203,"Jul 20 2007	Lovely but not perfect	This is a lovely, small European hotel with a great location just two blocks from Union Square. Our room, a &quot;deluxe queen&quot;, was comfortable, very clean, and beautifully decorated in a French motif. At $149.00 a night, through Expedia, it was a terrific bargin. The one criticism my wife and I have about the hotel is service related. Our first night our beds were pulled down. The next two evenings, however, we had no such service even though it was promised. Also, we were only given one set of towels the second day of our stay. Our experience with breakfast at the hotel restaurant, too, was not good. Very simply, the service was awful. (As an aside, the hotel does now serve coffee in the morning in the lobby. This had been a criticism in the past.) Even with these service-related caveats, we highly recommend this wonderful hotel. More attention from the hotel mangement to service would raise our evaluation from a 3.5 stars to 4 stars."
78,2203,"Jul 6 2007 	A great way to experience San Francisco	I stayed here w/ my wife in March and loved it. We approached the hotel's front desk after arriving in the city to inquire about a midweek 3-night stay. We received a great price and had breakfast included (HIGHLY recommended: brilliant food). The staff were courteous enough and the hotel offered a free Internet terminal in the lobby. This boutique hotel offered a beautifully-appointed and decorated room, but it is small (in a cozy way) and offers no view whatsoever. The location was perfect for us, this being our first time to the city. It's a stone's throw from Union Square, a short walk to the cable car and shopping."
79,2203,"Jun 18 2007 	Friendly staff but not perfect	We stayed 7 days / 6 nights. The highlight would be the very friendly and responsive staff. They are courteous without being snotty, which is the opposite of the hotel across the street (The CLIFT). Overall, the hotel is understated luxury without the snobbishness of many downtown SF hotels.The good:- Exceptionally friendly, responsive staff- Location near Union Square- Easy access to MUNI transport (buses, cable car)- Great bartenders in La Scene!- LCD television in room (~30in.)- Check-in and check-out were painless.The bad:- Housekeeping forgets to leave a robe or towels. (We had to ask daily for a new robe, as it was not replaced)- Beds are rock hard. I slept well, but did wake up sore every day.- NO doormanThe ugly:- Ask for a room on the upper floors. The homeless appear to be having a turf war at the intersection of Geary &amp; Taylor and are very noisy ALL NIGHT LONG.The best staff members are Marc @ the front desk and Martin @ La Scene."
80,2203,"Jun 5 2007 	A very interesting experience.	Paid 80 dollars for this room through Priceline, and it sounds as if that's a steal in SF. If we couldn't have gotten this deal, we probably would have ended up staying at the airport. Anyhow....a few things:- Yes, the bad part of town is nearby. Here's my tip: Don't go southwest of the hotel. That's the Tenderloin district and it isn't very pretty. if you stick to going east (shopping and theater) and north (Wharf, touristy areas, etc), you'll be fine. The neighborhood the actual hotel was in seemed fine to me.- The beds are indeed pretty hard. My fiancee and I woke up both mornings with big time back pain. Let's just say we're more thankful for our bed at home now.- The decorations are very beautiful...it's a departure from your &quot;typical&quot; hotel...which I guess is what defines a boutique.- The room wasn't as small as some people made it out to be. If you want a Hyatt sized room...well...stay at a Hyatt.- This isn't close to the Wharf really...so that was a letdown. It was quite a hike to the coast!All in all..worth the money though."
81,2203,"May 13 2007	great deal in good location	Best deal in town. Quaint and rooms were clean. Staff was helpful but no concierge in hotel. In theatre district - walked across street to see Jersey Boys, which was great. 1.5 blocks from cable car and 3 blocks from BART station. Walking distance to great shopping, chinatown and north beach."
82,2203,Apr 22 2007 	Great deal for San Fran	We recently stayed at the Warwick and was pleasently surprised. We received a great deal on the room especially for a weekend stay. It had everything we needed and was in a wonderful area of town. The bathroom was very large for an older city hotel. My fiancee loved the Plasma television in the room. The only thing I suggest is make sure you request a non-smoking room. We did not do this in advance and we were put in smoking. You could tell the difference. It had a strong smoke smell. Our clothes smelled of smoked even after we arrived in Napa several days later. This of course was an error on our part. Also be prepared to pay $35 a night for valet parking (the only non-public) with the hotel if you have a car. I would suggest this hotel to anyone. Great deal.
83,2203,"Apr 4 2007 	Ready to go back to the Warwick	The Warwick Regis is an old world charming hotel. Its staff is friendly, helpful and courteous. Our room was small but comfortable with all the amenities -- bar, TV, dresser, wardrobe, extra pillows, extra blankets and plenty of lamps. The bathroom was ample for our needs. Our room faced Geary and we were fine with that. We enjoyed the activity of the street and liked looking out the window at the busyness below. There's no in-room coffeemakers or any coffee downtstairs in the lobby. You can get a free cup before 7 a.m.but not after.That's the only only negative thing we found during our stay. We walked a few doors down to Starbucks and people from other hotels were there too getting the java fix.La Scene Restaurant and Bar is located right in the hotel and the food delicious. We had the price fixe menu and our waitress was tremendous with personal service and patience like no other. We walked all over Union Square during our stay, saw a play and shopped and ate. We even went to Waldgreens after midnight and felt safe. Yes,there are plenty of homeless people. Every big city has its homeless. We did not have a car with as and we came in on BART so we cannot comment on the parking."
84,2203,"Mar 6 2007 	Not too bad for SF	If you want to go to the Curran Theater (we saw &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;), this hotel can't be beat. It's literally across the street and very convenient to Union Square, restaurants, etc. As for the hotel itself, it's pretty decent. The front desk was not quite as friendly as others describe. Upon check-in (came via BART from East Bay), I had to stand for 5 minutes while they checked papers, talked on the phone, etc. Then it was pretty perfunctory. The plus: I asked for a top floor to keep the noise to a minimum. I got it...and then noted the windows have double-panels. You can open one, two or leave them closed for maximum quiet. The bed (as opposed to last reviewer) was just fine and it was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was cut above average. Yes, the room was fairly small, but they're all like that in SF. My main beef: When we checked in at 3, there was coffee, tea and cookies. But at 8 a.m. the next morning, nada. Nothing. No coffee (who ever heard of a hotel without coffee in the morning)? When I asked the desk, I was told, &quot;Oh, you can ask a waiter in the restaurant&quot; (and, I assume, pay $4 a cup or whatever for coffee). Would it kill them to put a pot in the lobby? All in all, though, I thought the Warwick Regis was a fine hotel for an evening of theater across the street."
85,2203,"Feb 26 2007	Cute but BEWARE the Rock-hard beds	I pricelined a room at the last minute and ended up here. This is a cute little boutique hotel with quaint rooms. The only criticism I have is the ROCK HARD beds. Yowch, I woke up with a sore back the next morning. I think the floor would have been more forgiving. Oh, and the road noise from outside was a bit much."
86,2203,"Feb 18 2007 	Nice place	I booked on Priceline and was worried because they claim it to be a 4 star and all other web pages claim three. I would say it is a three star, but a very nice one. My room was clean, no wear, and very nicely decorated. A bit small compared to large suburban hotels, but afterall this is in the middle of San Francisco. Some comments made in other reviews about adjacent businesses and street people are true of all downtown hotels. Fact is, San Francisco has a lot of homeless people on the streets and the city thinks they are doing a good job! Not so in comparison to other cities. Overall, I really like the Warwick especially since my collegues stayed nearby at the Milano which was positively boring and sterile by comparison. They would agree, the Warwick was much nicer and the staff was good."
87,2203,"Jan 1 2007 	It was alright.	I guess I was expecting something a little nicer when it said luxury 4 star. This hotel was clean and nice. It was on a busy street and so sleep was hard to come by. Being right on Geary Street, sirens could be heard all night and the old water pipes were noisy at 5am from the neighbor. The hotel is walking distance from Union Square and close to great galleries. Parking fees were really expensive but included in the room when we booked. I probably wouldn't stay here again unless it was a really good deal."
88,2203,"Nov 29 2006 	Old world elegance updated	First a note on the &quot;poor&quot; reviews: If you do not like quaint, cozy, warm, charming then do not stay here. If you think &quot;historic&quot; buildings are small, smelly, and have small elevators then do not stay here. If you do not want to experience San Francisco's energy, shopping, dining, theater all within walking distance then do not stay here. This is a great hotel, with each suite different from the next. The staff in both hotel and restaurant are exceptional and friendly. The fellow guests my partner and I met at the hotel bar were engaging, educated, and friendly ( we even exchanged email addresses) We will be back to the Warwick each time we visit the city. If you like cookie cutter, larger, cold hotel rooms stay at a Hyatt or Hilton or other namebrand hotel. This hotel offers TRUE San Francisco charm."
89,2203,"Nov 27 2006 	Exceeded expectations	I booked a Friday night stay at this hotel with apprehension after reading previous reviews. I must say that I was very satisfied with my stay. The room was small, but I have encountered smaller rooms in big cities. Our room overlooked Walgreens, but my teenage daughter and I had no difficulties sleeping as noise did not seem to be a problem. The room was very comfortable and clean. The location was great ,as we were there for shopping at Union Square. We took the Ferry into the City, so parking was not an issue. We called housekeeping for more pillows and it took them all of about 5 minutes to get them to us. We arrived back from dinner after 11:00p.m. and felt completely safe walking from Union Square. The only complaint was upon checkout. I booked online and received a rate that was not the same upon checkout. After providing the front desk clerk a copy of my confirmation however, it was quickly adjusted. As a travel agent, I would recomend this hotel to all of my clients."
90,2203,"Nov 24 2006 	Possibly in Transition?	In other reviews on this property I see several references to problems with the staff... Perhaps, not being rude  or unhelpful  but just clueless. I had the same experience  and this is the advice I have for staying at the Warwick. Manage your experience proactively  you can have a very nice stay in the city at the Warwick.It is a very useful home base for exploring the city  great central location. Easy to meet friends  shop  get to all forms of public transportation. Rooms on the back ally  though they do look onto the charms of city life  are quite for the most part  clean and well maintained. I never felt unsafe or compromised for my stay at the Warwick.What I found to be compromising was their bookkeeping/check-in procedure. Our front desk clerk was busy trying to answer phones while training new workers  everyone was being helpful there was a lot of busy work - but no real information. I signed in with my x on several locations of their official sheet - no smoking in the rooms  no pets in the rooms  your staying for this many nights... But realized that upon check out  nothing had been said about the rate I had booked and confirmed. This was of course my oversight  and in the end things did work out - but if I had a plane to catch  or some such deadline  this would have been a complete derailment of my day as it took three trips to the managers office downstairs and about 25 minutes to clear things up. I am a travel agent and upon booking a great insider rate, the deal is that you get their best available room upon check in. And we did get a great suite with two bathrooms on the 6th floor  on the back (quiet side) of the building. The hotel being none too busy  this seemed like a perfect time to take advantage of best available and we where quite happy with our stay. However, checkout became a game of untrained employees trying to figure out how to handle a situation they had no idea how to deal with or correct  as the charges to my account had been made at full rate  almost 3 times more per day- than the rate I had confirmed with my reservation system. I also have worked for years in retail, customer service  and this lack of empowerment, depth of knowledge in the front desk does not bode well for the image of the hotel  this is really the ONLY face any guest has for the location  and I would be hard pressed to send any clients (thought well placed, clean and semi-reasonably priced) still, clueless location. Proper hotel check-in procedures and more training  or perhaps better employee retention would easily put the Warwick higher on my list of SF recommendations."
91,2203,"Nov 3 2006	A secret we should keep	We heard about the Warwick Regis in the book &quot;Born to Shop, San Francisco&quot; by Suzy Gershman. The hotel lives up to the great review in every respect. We definitely will book here on our return to The City."
92,2203,"Oct 24 2006 	This Hotel and Priceline both stink....	This hotel absolutely stinks - literally.I am a very well seasoned traveler and was absolutely mortified by the first room I was assigned at this hotel.The first room was overlooking an alley, no more than 10 feet from the street level. The window was covered in vomit from a street person and from what I could see I was looking accoss into another appartment with a man shooting up. Looking directly down - an adult sex/massage place. Needless to say, I didn't feel safe.So, when I contacted Priceline.com, which was absolutely worthless in the end, they contacted the front desk. Shortly, I was contact by the front desk and they sent a manager to look at the room and he was surprised to say the least.At that point, they were accomodating and moved me to the 6th floor. When I got to the room, the T.V. did not work and the bathroom had no sink - it was located in the room which I thought was strange. I noticed it was very hot and after phoning the front desk, I learned that they had no a/c in the hotel.I decided that I had been sold a bill of goods by Priceline, and once again, I phoned them to try and resolve the issue which was a pathetic mistake. To try and deal with Priceline to resolve an issue is nearly impossible and I suspect they try and make it that way.Priceline refused initially to refund my money. They called the hotel revenue manager and she had declined. So, I put Priceline on hold, phoned her directly downstairs and explained my situation. She agreed to the refund and apologized. So, I basically ended up getting out of a non-refundable, scummy hotel with no help from Priceline who sold it to me. This hotel stinks and is not a boutique hotel and Pricline is just as bad. This hotel needs a renovation to include a/c and Pricline should represent their properties accordingly.Stay away from this hotel and stay away from Pricline - they won't help you if you're in a pinch."
93,2203,"Oct 19 2006 	Never got to find out	My husband and I were honeymooning in Northern California. We were looking forward to staying at the WR for our 2 night stay in San Francisco before heading further up the coast. When we arrived to the curb at the vallet, we were pleased with the location and the outside appearance of the motel and looking forward to settling in and relaxing after long day in the car. The vallet asked our names, went inside to I guess let the front dest know our names and came back out watching us unload our car. We were told that we had to get everything out now that we would want because they park the cars in different garages and it wouldn't be easily accesible for us to get our belongings in and out. After 10 minutes of us deciding what we would need and what we would keep in the car, we handed him our keys and proceeded into the front desk. The gentleman at the front desk gave us some line about how 'all the motels in the area had a glitch in scheduling and most of them-including the WR of course- were double booked'. Instead of honoring our reservations, they were sending us to the Courtyard by Marriott, where they would pay the extra on the bill and where he promised we would enjoy ourselves. It was true, we did enjoy the Courtyard by Marriott- A lot. We had a beautiful view of the city at night and had access to our car whenever we needed it. Vallet even ran to put things in and remove things from the vehicle. Everyone at the Courtyard by Marriott was sooo nice. I was really offended by the Warwick Regis, however. I couldn't believe that they waited for us to remove all of our luggage from the car at the curb before they explained to us we were not staying there. I thought that was incredibly rude. I also found it odd that other guests were coming in and checking in with no problems. If the motel was infact double booked, then why didn't they send people off based on a first come first serve basis? Also, they had 2 contact numbers for me, one which was my cellular phone which I had on myself. Why no phone call about the change in plans? Honestly, I believe that the 'double booking' story I was given was complete crap. I am assuming that because there were other events going on in the city at the same time, they probably got more money for the rooms, so they sent us on our way or something to that effect. If you're going to SF, stay at the Courtyard by Marriott. It's a great location and a nice clean place to stay."
94,2203,"Oct 12 2006 	Don't Stay at the Warwick	My husband and I stayed at the Warwick Regis for one night after spending four at the Hyatt at the Ferry Building. My husband and I are well-traveled, so we decided on the Warwick upon knowing its reputation in New York. When we arrived ahead of check-in time, we were told that we would be getting a suite room. However, the desk clerk changed and we were later told that we had a standard queen room. There was a sign posted outside of the door that stated, &quot;Chemicals on the premises may cause cancer or be a danger to pregnant women.&quot; What??? The exact wording may not be there, but the point was clear. We asked the desk attendant about the sign and he sputtered something about the kitchen and keeping people out of the alley. Our room seemed as if it hadn't been dusted in several months. Also, we had difficulty getting our luggage in the room due to it's EXTRAORDINARILY small size. The bed was supposed to be a &quot;queen,&quot; but was actually full-sized. The sheets were scratchy and deposited lint on my black pants. The pillows were small and flat. We had to open the windows to let in fresh air, but people on the street below were so noisy (we were on the 6th floor) that we couldn't sleep! If you're wise, do NOT stay here."
95,2203,"Sep 5 2006 	Very pleasant experience	We have just returned from San Francisco and staying at the Warwick Regis Hotel. I agree the rooms are certainly small but they are charming, very clean and extremely well maintained. It was a wonderful base to return to and very well located. Excellent value for money. We would definitely return."
96,2203,"Aug 28 2006 	Great time at the Warwick	After reading many reviews I decided on the Warwick for a 3 day weekend in San Francisco. I found it to be charming. The staff was exceptional. When the shuttle bus to the airport failed to show up at the scheduled time the front desk clerk helped me find alternate transportation.Yes, the room is not huge but for 1 or 2 persons it was just fine.I had a nice quiet room on the 7th floor. Everything is within walking distance, shopping, theaters, restaurants etc.I will definitely return to the Warwick on my next visit to San Francisco."
97,2203,"Aug 16 2006 	Sooo glad I didn't stay here!	I was recently in San Francisco in July 2006 and stayed at the Palace hotel. I did not actually stay at this hotel, but m boyfriend and I thought about it - so we went to the hotel to take a look at a room.I am so glad we did not make a reservation at this place. The staff was very friendly and accomodating to let us look at the room, but the small size of everything from the lobby to the elevator and rooms sent me into a panic attack. If you are the slightest claustrophobic, I would not advise staying here. There is NO air conditioning, the SUITE was about 400 cramped sq.ft. and the decor was horrifying and dark/gothic. There are loads of homeless sleeping outside sprawled on the sidewalk outside the hotel.Just thought this may help someone make a decision on what hotels to book or not book - since I didn't know...the Palace Hotel is great..."
98,2203,"Jul 30 2006 	Charming but not my cup of tea...	We stayed 3 nights, the rate was excellent and the location is great. Just a short walk to all the shopping you could ever want. The staff was very very friendly which made up for the oldness of the &quot;Old charm'. The room was clean but small. We had the junior suite which is the way to go so that you can have walking room and a place to sit. The armoires and bed looked just as it does on the web...charming. There is a ceiling fan and you can open the windows for some fresh air. The windows could use a good washing. The room with the sleeper sofa has the flat panel TV which is nice and there is actually turn down service. This &quot;old charming&quot; hotel we were told use to be a residence apartment in 1918. The hotel could use some sprucing up and a little more added amenties such as coffee maker. So it was an okay place to stay but honestly I wish I had spent just a little more for more modern accomadations. The &quot;old charm&quot; for me was not exactly my cup of tea. We did have a great time and we love San Francisco!!"
99,2203,"Jul 25 2006	Warwick Regis A+	Excellent little &quot;boutique&quot; hotel! Very Friendly staff! Perfect Location! We stayed in the Warwick Regis for 4 nights over the 4th of July weekend. Our stay was excellent! Perfect experience. Yes, the rooms are a little small and the sink/vanity is outside of the bathroom...but overall the rooms are very nice! They are decorated well and kept very clean! There is a safe and a fridge for you to use during your stay! There were free cookies and tea in the afternoon and chocolates on our turned-down bed at night! Free coffee would have been nice but they didn't have any. The good news is...there is a Starbucks like 3 doors down. Like I said excellent location. The only downside... was parking. It was pretty expensive ($29/night plus taxes etc), but what do you expect so close to Union Square in downtown San Fran. I would definetly recommend the Warwick Regis hotel."
100,2203,"Jul 21 2006	Nice...	Nice... that about covers it. Staff is very helpful and friendly, and the place is very clean and well kept. Still... some of the rooms ARE a bit small. The ironing board hangs on the back of the bathroom door making a tiny closet of a bathroom even smaller. Neighborhood can be a bit dicey, but it's fine during the day. Would we stay there again? For the right price... but I'd still shop around a bit first to see if we could find something a step up for the same price. Frankly, if it was available I'd probably go up the street to the Hotel Adagio."
101,2203,"Jul 3 2006	Repeat guest- still impressed!	We first found out about this hotel from some of our friends... two different couples at different times... who raved about the Warwick Regis and said it's where they always stay when they drive into the city (we live only an hour or so away). So we tried it for the first time about four years ago and have stayed there on average two or three times a year since then. Pros:Extremely safe, convenient location, walking distance to pretty much everything we need or wantOther locations in the city are just a quick cab ride awayWelcoming and helpful staffLovely, unique, traditional decor in each room and beds (some canopy beds) are comfortableMeticulously clean and nicely arranged roomsGreat bar in lobby for pre-dinner cocktails or people watchingDelicious breakfast in the restaurant Excellent affordable pricing- you can get great deals on their websiteSeveral choices for rooms, including Deluxe rooms, and Jr. SuitesTerrific spa products in the bathsTurn-down service is a nice touchRemovable Window fans that fit in the windowsills and suck in the cool night airCons: One side of the hotel faces a Walgreen's Drug store- not the most special of San Francisco viewsSan Francisco streets, like any big city's, are NOISY throughout the night. That's a fact. You will hear the noise even on the upper floors. No A/C- rooms can get stuffy- but there are seriously only about 10 days a year in SF that you would even want A/CRooms are small. It's worth upgrading to at least the Deluxe and even better, the jr. Suite. A size upgrade makes a big difference and can often be done at little costI have had difficulty getting the front desk to recommend certain rooms- they are noncommittal at bestLobby is small (but really lovely) and lobby/restaurant restrooms are in the basement, down a long hallway with offices and maintenance closets, past workers talking about stuff you don't want to hear about (I&quot;d rather not hear details about the innermost workings of a hotel and workers complaining about mgmt, etc.)We travel a lot and live in a tourist area ourselves, and every month or so we find ourselves craving a stay at the Warwick Regis. A really nice feeling hotel and a great home base for exploring San Francisco- and it won't cost you a fortune!!"
102,2203,"Apr 11 2006 	Nice hotel with nice service in a good location.	Just two blocks west of Union Square (and Powell St. with its cross-city cable-car line), this was a little gem. It was clean and had a bit of old-world charm. Just 7 stories (I was on the 7th) and originally was the &quot;Maryland Hotel&quot; built in 1913 (when the stay was just $1 per night). Service at the desk was excellent. The room was small but well furnished (with flat-screen TV and antiques). I didn't use the restaurant in the hotel; one can easily walk to any number of eateries (from fast food to expensive places - all within a block or so). I was attending a meeting at the Mosconi Convention center, and had a daily walk of about 20 minutes (maybe 15) each way (which was easy and nearly level).The surrounding of the hotel were good. Lots of shopping at high-end stores, and a quick hop on a cable-car can put you at Fisherman's Wharf within 10 minutes."
103,2203,"Apr 5 2006	Clean Quiet 	I stayed at this Hotel, just steps away from the City's Theatre district to attend a seminar at the Crowne Plaza, north of Union Square. My walk to the seminar hotel was around 15 minutes. I stayed during the beginning of March of 2006. There are many resturants and food stores nearby. My check in and check out were smooth and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful.Rooms were old but clean and the cleaning staff did a very good job of cleaning the room each day. The sink is actually in the room and not in the bathroom.Since I was spending most of my time at the seminar, I did not spend too much time in my room. If I was staying with my girlfriend in the City, I'd probably stay somewhere more upscale. But if your looking for a convenient, clean, quiet no frills place to stay, then I recommend this Hotel. I booked the room with a online travel service."
104,2203,"Apr 1 2006	Gem in Union Square	I wasn't sure what to expect after reading other reviews, but I had a wonderful experience at the Warwick. It's in a great location just two blocks from Union Square, has cozy, clean rooms, and a very helpful and attentive staff. We found a great deal for only $118 per night, too. The rooms are small, but remember this is a European-style boutique hotel. There was plenty of space for my husband and I in our room, and we didn't book a suite. Other reviewers have complained about street noise, but we had peace and quiet in our room on the top floor. When we checked in I requested the highest room available and even though the hotel was fully booked, they put us on the top floor. I highly recommend this hotel."
105,2203,Mar 3 2006	Convienient but small	I purchased this boutique hotel through Priceline. The hotel is near Union Square which makes it convienient to both the sights of SF as well as transit. Parking at the hotel was 29.00 per day plus 4.00 tax (which is par for the area). The hotel allows in and out privledges. The hotel was renovated in the late 1980's and is starting to show its age. The standard rooms are very small and are configured with a single queen bed. If you have more than two people in your party you will want to consider upgrading to a larger room. The room was clean and the hotel staff was attentive and helpful. This hotel (probably like many other in SF) did not seem to have AC. The area the hotel is in (Union Square) was not very touristy like Fisherman's Wharf. Keep this fact in mind when travelling with kids.
106,2203,Feb 25 2006	Central / close to Union Sq	My partner and I had a room for 4 nights and we have no complaints. The Hotel is very close to Union SQ and Market Street. We walked to the train station (for the airport-train). We had dinner at Max on the Square just a few minutes down the road.The Hotel offers free shower gel et. and is clean.Romm was of a good size. Would stay again.
107,2203,"Nov 30 2005 	Loved the Warwick Regis	I stayed at the Warwick Regis for a week on business. The location was terrific- just a short walk to Union Square, and there was a bus stop right out front. The staff was the most professional, helpful staff I have ever encountered. The room was tiny, but it was more than adequate for one person. The decor definately made you feel like you were in a bed and breakfast- extremely charming. I strongly recommend the breakfast that they serve every morning- the food was terrific and the juice was freshly squeezed. I will stay in the Warwick Regis on all of my return trips to SF."
108,2203,"Nov 12 2005	Exactly what I needed!	I was REALLY worried about my reservation at this hotel after I read the review from the single woman from Ontario because I, too, was traveling alone. I am glad that I kept my reservation, though. I thought that the Warwick Regis was a great choice. As with almost any urban area there were rough characters on the streets. However, because the hotel was small and there was a 24 hour hotel reception desk, I felt more comfortable coming from and going to the hotel. Although the rooms were small. the antiques were beautiful and gave the hotel the feeing of a bed and breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
109,2203,"Oct 12 2005	Warwick Regis: uncomfortable neighbourhood	I'm a woman in her early 30's and stayed on my own at the Warwick Regis in San Fran in the summer of 2004. The hotel itself is very pretty in an old-fashioned way (with new fabrics and decor of course). My window faced a wall, so the room felt dark despite being nicely decorated. In addition, I found the neighbourhood felt unsafe at night for a woman alone. The hotel is right between the theatre district on one side and an impoverished neighbourhood with drug use and drug sales going on on the other side (the Tenderloin).If you're a tourist and want to be in a lively, safe, and tourist-focused area of the city, you should stay in the Fisherman's Wharf neighbourhood.lesley"
110,2203,"Oct 3 2005	small smaller smallest!	We recently stayed for two nights at the Warwick Regis, and had mixed experiences throughout. Perhaps we should have recognized that there would be some ups-and-downs immediately when, during check-in, one very hospitable clerk took us through the sign-in process while another Asian woman clerk screamed into a phone at the desk within five feet of us throughout the entire ten minutes of this uncomfortable and unwelcoming encounter! Our rental vehicle was valet-parked, a pricey ($29 +) convenience that allows unlimited access throughout the day, rather than &quot;in and leave it&quot; for the week end. It was always ready after we called down about 20-30 minutes before we needed it. Thank you, Nestor! The next- and major- disappointment was the size of our travel-site package room: surely the smallest they have! Be sure to check this beforehand, as it was barely big enough to walk around the canopied bed and avoid hitting the huge armoire. An upgrade would have added $40 per night to the bill. The room is clean, if not crisp- with its period brocade furniture and chandelier. The bathroom desperately needed a ventilation fan, as it harbored dampness and molding grout. Opening windows to get fresh air (since air conditioning is so un-SF) only lets in the rumbles and sirens of the traffic on Geary Street, a major thoroughfare. Also be careful about the snack basket placed bedside: the pricelist was missing and the temptation was great. The breakfast buffet looked appealing, but the very stately dining room on the right never seemed to have a diner throughout our two evenings stay. Coffee is free for the guests who venture in and ask for a cup -to-go."
111,2203,"Aug 25 2005	Sweet helpful friendly 	Stayed here for two nights during the last few days of a whirlwind tour of northern california.. Found the front desk staff to be sweet, helpful, friendly and courteous.. the room was fine, although we did ask for an upgrade after the first night when it seemed as if all the fire trucks from SF's firehouses screamed by on Geary Streeet at about 3am.. We were moved upstairs the next day (they moved all our bags while we were out galavanting) to a much quieter 7th floor room and slept soundly that night. Free internet access, delicious breakfast, and great location (easy access to all public transportation) were excellent perks. Beautiful bathrooms, cotton robes, and good water pressure for showers were also appreciated and enjoyed. Leave your car at home or return it to the rental place (thats what we did) and take the trolley, bus, or BART.. they go everywhere, and parking is hugely expensive anywhere in SF. I&quot;ll stay here again in a heartbeat! :)"
112,2203,"Jul 18 2005	Friendly Staff 	The room was clean and comfortable - though small. However, I felt that was to be expected in SF and for the price, it was larger than the first hotel we had stayed at a few days prior. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but it was extremely dependable. There were no water problems, no heat or AC problems, no noise problems, no cleanliness problems.The staff was extremely kind. I had a print I bought which was too big for me to carry on to the plane, but I was hesitant about checking it in with the airline. The staff assured me that they could have it Fed-Ex'd to my address. A day later, I received a call from them saying they were having problems as Fed Ex wanted it packaged a certain way, etc. etc. Over the next few days over the phone, they were able to package it and price out the shipping with UPS instead to save me $100! I received my print in one piece, and I thank their patience and willingness to go the extra mile for their customers.I would definitely stay there again. You can't go wrong when the staff is willing to do that much for you."
113,2203,"Jun 2 2005	Lovely hotel Wonderful service	We felt like we were the only guests at the hotel. The service was great! The room was kind of small, but very charming and comfortable. It is close to the major shopping district with plenty of good restaurants nearby."
114,2203,"Jan 27 2005	Great Place!	We had an excellent time at this hotel. We were in an upgraded room on the corner of the building and thought it was absolutely beautiful -- canopy bed, marble bathroom. It did not have air conditioning, but we stayed in the end of June and did not feel a bit uncomfortable. The location was great. A nice little cafe around the corner -- Pinecrest Cafe. But, many other restaurants to chose from. We walked to the subway to return to the airport (maybe 6 blocks) without any trouble and was actually easier, cheaper and much more relaxing than a shuttle."
115,2203,"Nov 15 2004	It was just fine for us	We spent 4 nights in the Warwick Regis In Nov/04 and found much of what other reviewers said to be true. Yes, the rooms are small. Yes, the sink is in the main room area. Yes, it is close to &quot;The Tenderloin&quot; Yes, it can be quite noisy even for our room on the 7th floor. However, these things were not detrimental to the whole hotel experience. The hotel has a great location, was clean and beautifully furnished, very quiet on the inside, and the staff were helpful but not overbearing. Depending on what you are looking for, this could be the place for you."
116,2203,"Nov 1 2004	The best experience!	We loved this hotel. It's a great value, with 1st class service, beautiful rooms. It is everything it says it is. I didn't find our room to be too small, we had a bath with a full bathtub, turndown service at night and all of the staff were extremely helpful. It's in a great location and near lots of public transportation. I will definitely stay there again and recommend this hotel to all my friends."

1,2204,San Fran is the Place!	I loved the location of the hotel along with the service inside and outside the room. It was great to be able to get everywhere I wanted to go by just walking out the front door. All the people were very hospitable.
2,2204,"Very good hotel in a good location	I had 7 nights in this Westin. In the beginning I thought 5th floor will be really noisy for a SF downtown hotel, but it relatively quiet. Of ourse you hear the fire fighters when they do their regular tours in downtown. But this is also applicable for &gt; 30th floors.The rooms was stylish and roomy. There even was a healthy stepper thing located next to the floor to ceiling windows. Nice, clean bathroom as well. The bar and restaurant are also nice, but rather expensive."
3,2204,"Nov 15 2009 	Great home base to explore the city	Location, location, location applies in real estate and in travel, and this hotel has a perfect location to explore San Francisco. It's right around the corner from the downtown shopping district, Union Square and Chinatown, and my wife and I were able to hoof it to Telegraph Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, Japantown, the Painted Ladies and Lombard Street (though be prepared: this city's huge hills are NO JOKE). Being able to walk everywhere is a blessing, considering the outrageous charge of nearly $50/night to park a car here.The hotel itself is nothing to write home about, really, but the rooms are adequate and of course have the Heavenly Beds that make Westin worth staying at. The first room they gave us was small and had a terrible view, but we were quickly upgraded when we asked for a better view, and we could see the bay and the sunrise from our next room.I would recommend this hotel mostly for the location, though if you're expecting something really luxurious for the price you pay, you probably won't get what you're looking for."
4,2204,"Nov 12 2009 	Nice business hotel in the center of town	Convenient for the convention center and central San Francisco. Really a standard Westin - nothing to particularly complain about, but nothing memorable."
5,2204,"Nov 7 2009 	Westin Excellence with a tinge of uncharacteristic unfriendliness.	Always a fan of Westins, W's etc, the Starwood chain. However, several people at this particular location provided less than the welcoming hospitality that I have come to know. They were not terrible in general, but in comparison to the calliber of service from this chain, they were sub-par. Primarily, this was the front desk as bar tenders, baggage handlers, an droom staff were superb. However, this is a nice, clean, beautiful hotel in a very convenient and central location. You won't have anything fantastic right outside your doorstep or have a neighborhoody feel, but you are centrally located with ease to get to many major attractions. Blocks to shopping, Union Square, the financial district, BART transportation and a longer but acceptable walk to the Embarcadero and Ferry Terminal. Prices can vary drastically at this hotel so when you get a good deal, it can't be beat but often, there will be better values. The W down the street was a far more enjoyable experience. The bed is amazing as always, the room was slightly smaller than typical, but this IS San Franciso so it was quite ample. The room staff was responsive, extremely friendly and diligent. Concierge was also amazing both before my arrival and during."
6,2204,"Nov 6 2009 	Nice hotel near Union Square	We stayed with some friends and had two rooms, both of which we upgraded for $20 to deluxe rooms. The upgrade added floor to ceiling windows and a king size bed. The rooms were located next to each other on the 23rd floor, however one room was large with a sitting area and the other was about 75% of the size and fairly compact. Parking is expensive at the hotel (about average with other hotels in the area) and the amenities in the room are fairly limited compared to other Starwood hotels I've stayed at. The room did include a personal coffee maker with Starbuck's coffee, which was an excellent touch and much easier to use then your average hotel coffee maker. Overall, a nice clean 4-star hotel in the Union Square area, but nothing amazing!"
7,2204,"Nov 1 2009 	Vanilla kind of place but great location	Stayed here for a conference in the end of May. The conference facilities were great, but as for our room, on the whole I'd have to say it was just vanilla...The beds were comfortable but not over the top, the bathroom was CRAZY small. We called to ask for a fridge for our room to keep some wine chilled and it took a few calls before we got it. Would have been easier if we could have just temporarily moved the stuff in the minibar fridge out but they have one of those sensors that charges you when something gets moved, so we didn't try it. Our room was on the 23rd floor, which provided some interest for my young kids....watching fire trucks approach the area from 10 blocks away, watching the fog roll across the city, etc. As for location, it is tough to beat. My husband and kids joined me for the trip even though I was attending conferences for most of the time, and they had the cable car terminus, union square, and the Yerba Buena park all within a 5 min walk. A BART station is also right nearby. We also took the F cable car down to the market at Embarcadero. The food stands there are amazing -- just too bad it isn't open for longer hours. For anyone going to a convention at the Moscone center, it is 1 block away. We ate twice at restaurants that were within walking distance of the hotel and had been recommended by the concierge. I thought both were uninspiring. We had thought about eating at the restaurant downstairs but the menu was rather pricey and their prix fixe menu (one night a week) only had 2 choices for entrees, both red meat which I don't eat. Best meal the whole trip was our burrito run into the Mission!!Two separate notes...our conference &quot;rate&quot; offered by the organizer was about $150/night higher than the rate I booked the room for online. At the rate I got, I think it's an OK value, but no one should pay &gt;$200 for a room here. It's just not that nice and I'm sure you could find better easily.On a final up note, we had a late flight home and the front desk was very accommodating about holding our bags until our departure to the airport at 6pm. We had asked that they have a cab waiting to take us to the airport when we returned from sightseeing shortly before 6. Instead of a cab, they had the hotel &quot;driver&quot; take us for the same cost as a cab. Town car instead of a taxi and a super friendly and safe driver."
8,2204,"Oct 27 2009 	OK for business	I'm just back from business having stayed at the Westin. The location is good for business and especially conventions as Moscone is a 5 minute walk. If you're there for pleasure its an OK location with Union Square about 10 mins walk. Its a good hotel and the service was fine but ask for a room away from the lifts. The noise that comes through the air conditiong ducts in these rooms is pretty loud. After one night they moved me without fuss, though. My only other gripes, and these are universal, is the price of wifi $14.95/day and breakfast - $25 for a buffet?"
9,2204,"Oct 24 2009 	Great base for City stay	We stayed in a very nice room, tastefully decorated and extremely clean it wasn't the biggest room we've ever had but was The bathroom was nice and modern with fluffy towels and good quality toiletries. This is quite a big, busy hotel we were never disturbed by other guests or traffic noise etc. The bed was extremely comfortable and had great pillows as well.The use of the internet was expensive $15 for 24 hours - noon to noon the following day, we found free internet at Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf shop about 5 minutes walk away. We booked with Expedia and felt we had good value for money for this hotel."
10,2204,"Oct 19 2009 	Strong potential good location some serious lapses at check-in	We are bay area residents who stayed here while on business for the day and going to dinner and the theater in the evening. Location adjacent to Yerba Buena gardens, off Market Street, near several major museums and public trans, is quite good. It's a stone's throw from the Four Seasons which is substantially more costly. The decor is modern and well done; the room was of modest size but very well kept up and tastefully decorated; comfy bed, in-room Starbucks. Excellent black-out curtains; noise level on the 8th floor was minimal, suggesting very good construction. Amenities included essentials (soap, lotion, shampoo). Sufficient towels. There were 3 electrical outlets and an Internet cable plug-in spot on a strip on the very compact-sized desk. I must comment on check in, which was **dreadful**, unless you like to stand in line for an hour with bags. There were at least 100 people in front of us with two reception people working the desk. The young staff (concierge) tried valiantly to make nice, handed out bottled water, said, &quot;Everyone arrived at once; were you all on the same bus?&quot; (Not exactly.) And the line was half way across the lobby every time some of our party checked between noon and 3:45 when we finally gutted out the line. My husband tried to check in earlier in the day, and they said, &quot;no, after 3 only,&quot; but later while we were clearly annoyed in line, came by and asked us if we had done &quot;pre-check in.&quot; What? We would have had you offered in that morning!! In fairness, there was a marathon in town that day, but if you know you have 1000 people checking in, you need to have the foresight to add staff or stagger the hours you are checking people in. After an hour or so a couple more people were finally added to help check in. I would recommend this hotel but only with the caveat that you sort out your check in time and ask about &quot;pre-check in&quot; when you make the reservation. Also if you have a car, avoid the high hotel traffic times for valet service because I heard people in line complaining about the bottleneck there (was not a problem early in the a.m. however)."
11,2204,Oct 12 2009 	Very Classy Elegant and Beautiful Hotel!	This hotel is right in the heart of the city!Very convenient to walk around everywhere. Beautiful majestic rooms and wonderful view of San Francisso.Thoroughly enjoyed living there!!! Extremely modern and elegant hotel!
12,2204,"Oct 8 2009	My Favorite place in the US	We had a wonderful time in San Francisco. We stayed at the Westin, Market Street. The rooms were spacious, clean, and the service was great. There were so many attractions to see, and things to do, I can't name them all. Alcatraz is a MUST DO! We were there for like 4 hours. It is fairly easy to get around the city, on public transportation, if you are staying down town. We were there for 4 days and did not need a car. There are all kinds of neat little restaruants tucked in different neighborhoods, of the city. Be sure to ask where you are staying for suggestions. All in all, I can't wait to go back."
13,2204,"Oct 2 2009 	Nice Hotel	The Westin Market Street is a very nice 'upmarket' hotel in an excellent location in San Francisco - a quick walk to Union Square and public transport on Mraket Street to just about anywhereWe ( family of 2 adults + 2 kids, 5 and 13) had a large, bright and very clean room - on the 7th floor I think - and the beds were wonderfully comfortable. Bathroom was a little dark, but spotless and we had a bath , which was nice for the little one.Check-in was smooth and the girl at the desk who dealt with us was extremely pleasant, as were all of the staff we met there, including in the restaurant. This was a pleasant surprise given some of the remarks made on this site.We didn't have breakfast at the hotel - Starbucks is just up the street if all you want is a coffee and pastry- but we did have a very good , if rather expensive, meal at &quot;Ducca&quot;.My only complaint would be that our room was right next to the service elevators that rumbled noisily up and down late at night and early in the morning. I presume that our room allocation was due to the fact that we had got an absolutely fantastic rate on Expedia, which I imagine gives the hotel some scope to allocate better -placed rooms to those paying the full whack.All in all our stay was very pleasant, and if we're ever back in SF ( it's a long way from France!) and get a similar deal, then I'd stay there again."
14,2204,"Sep 30 2009 	Decent place if you get a decent deal	I stayed there with my gf for 4 nights. I had no complaints, other than the usual hotel issues you would have for a place that costs $90/night. Beds are as always very comfortable and nice as with all other Westin hotels. But why do the shower/tub drains never drain properly? It's not just this hotel but with ALL hotels that I've visited in the past 2 years. I have no idea. If you get a room for $80/night or better, I say this place is good. Anything above is iffy. Good luck."
15,2204,Sep 28 2009 	Great Hotel in the best part of the city	We had a great stay for 5 nights at this Westin hotel - Great location- A short walk from the ferry building and embarcado aswell as the city center.We were upgraded on arrival to a delux room with great panoramic views of the city near the top floor at no cost. Although slightly on the small side the room was clean and nice- The bed was really comfy and the in room starbucks coffee maker and huge plasma TV were great bonuses!Staff at the hotel were also really helpful and friendly.Hotel restaurant was also great - One of the best meals we ate in SF!Great Hotel - Would definatley stay here again.
16,2204,Sep 24 2009 	Great stay	The Westin Market St. is a well located hotel with good facilities. Located on 3rd St. about a 5min walk from Union Square makes it ideal for shopping and good restaurants. The service was good enough and the rooms had all the facilites you expect from a 4* hotel. No swimming pool here though!!!
17,2204,"Sep 23 2009 	It was fine for one night	They had lost my reservation but managed to squeeze me in. The staff was nice and helpful. The room was on the small side but comfy. One caveat. They claim to have 24 hour room service which actually ends at 1030 pm. so if you check in late and want to eat, they will give you a pizza delivery menu and suggest the store next door foe beverages or cold snacks. All the other restaurants in the immediate vicinity close early also. The bed was the best I had on the trip. It's close to the Moscone center, shopping and museums. It was fine but not anything I'll be rushing back to. The room would suit a solo traveller but if more than that, probably be tripping over each other"
18,2204,"Sep 20 2009 	Disappointed by outrageous fees and lack of concern for guests	We stayed at this hotel for two nights after a long drive from LA. The moment we arrived the valet greeted us by telling us that there was a $45 parking charge (+tax!) per night and that valet parking was the only option. Only later did we discover that there is a public parking garage right across the street. Approx. $50 for parking per night seems like highway robbery to me, no matter what city it's in, or how nice the hotel is!The staff at the front desk were courteous and the bellman was pleasant. The room was nicely decorated and the beds were fairly comfortable. On the first night of our stay however the guests next door were partying and drinking which turned into screaming and hollering in some type of domestic dispute at around 1am. I was on the verge of calling the police when I called down to the front desk at 1:30am. No one from security ever showed up and our noisy neighbours finally quieted down around 2:30am. When I complained to the front desk the next morning nothing was done. They simply blamed it on &quot;unruly guests&quot;. The walls between the rooms are thin so noise travels well, and the heavy metal room doors also slam loudly which echoes down the hall anytime a guest leaves their room.This hotel has the typical overpriced minibar ($5 for a can of soda?) and they also charge $15 per day for wireless internet. In this day and age that's just poor service. If the cafe on the corner can offer free wireless, so can the Westin. There is a convenience store next door that sells soda and snacks so skip the minibar and save yourself from the price gauging.In the end we were highly disappointed by our stay, feeling overcharged and undervalued as guests. I'd skip this hotel and find somewhere where they offer your amenities for free and care about their guests concerns."
19,2204,"Sep 16 2009 	Great location great room ok service	Stayed in a 'Premier Room' at the Westin Market Street in San Francisco. Upon driving up to the lobby, there was no one to help with the bags or door and navigating through the revolving door with luggage was tricky. Had to wait several minutes at check-in as the two attendants on duty were busy with other customers.Room was clean, spacious, and well maintained. The view was spectacular since the room was on a high floor facing the Moscone Center, Yerba Buena Gardens, and the Metreon.Location was excellent, right off Market street and convenient walk to union square and extended walking distance to Giants Stadium and the piers. Paid a 'starpicks' special rate, which made the room fairly reasonable for its location and quality.Overall a pleasant experience. The hotel meets standard Westin comforts, decor, and service, with an excellent location for exploring the city."
20,2204,"Sep 13 2009 	Disappointing..............	Just returned from a 8 day trip to California, 4 of which were spent in San Francisco, at the Westin on Market. I am a 57 yo female, and I was traveling with my brother, 61.We arrived at 3pm, and was told that the rooms were not ready...okay...no worries....we went to Starbucks and sat there for an hour, came back, and were given our two rooms...my brother's was still dirty and unmade, with someone else's luggage in it.My room had no safe...the bolts were in the closet, but the safe was missing. Okay...again no worries...At 11pm that evening, the elevators were going non stop and making horrendous noise, which was right on the other side of the bedroom wall. I called downstairs and asked about it. They said they shut them off at midnight. They DO NOT...Next morning, went to see the manager and requested a room change.This I had no problems with, the desk clerk was excellent, and made sure I was moved to another room. I did find the diningroom staff at breakfast to be somewhat less than congenial, they seemed put out when asked for something, such as cream for the coffee.We did purchase these rooms through Expedia, and I don't know whether that is the reason we were given the poorer rooms, but I think one should be treated as well as the next guest, no matter how the rooms were procurred.At the end...we just returned home today, and I received a phone call from my brother...he said he was billed an additional $200 for the mini bar which neither one of us touched, or moved because we know that these are very sensitive.I honestly don't think I will ever stay at another Westin because of the experiences of this week......Go down one block to 4th St and do yourself a favor and stay at the Marriott!!!"
21,2204,"Sep 12 2009 	Excellent hotel in a great location	We spent 3 nights at the Westin and loved it there! THE HOTEL:Pros:It was an elegant, clean, comfortable hotel. The staff were super friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. We asked for a crib for our toddler, and the front desk host, Mark, even offered us a small refrigerator for our room which came in really handy! Also, the crib was clean and safe for our little guy. Our room was on the fourth floor and was near the elevators, but we didn't hear any noise at all. Cons:We did hear conversations coming from next door, though, so I guess the walls are pretty thin. We also didn't have a view from our window. And it would have been nice to have a pool so that we could have taken our son swimming.THE LOCATION:Pros:Market Street is the one long diagonal street that runs through the city. On that street are tons of shops, a shopping mall, restaurants, the start of the cable car route, lots of bus stops, and also access to the BART (bay area rapid transit). Our entire trip was by public transit (with a kid in a stroller) and we found the location to be really convenient and so close to everything. We did the City Pass and we could get to all the attractions quite easily.Cons:None! It was a fabulous location.We were really happy with our stay and definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!"
22,2204,"Sep 11 2009 	This is how a Westin should feel	Don't stay at Westins too much, last was New Orleans, but I like how the brand's hotels are all very consistent in both design, service, and location. Like New Orleans, this was a recently remodeled hotel (formerly called The Argent), but had been given a pretty thorough Westin makeover. The lobby rooms are totally Westin-ized, with very comfy Heavenly beds, clean-lined furniture, stark white walls, large flatscreen TV, and upscale bathroom. Actually the rooms are a very good size for a hotel like this, definately wider than usual. We were three guys, and were able to fit a (very comfy) cot into a room with 2 double beds, with plenty of room to spare. Over the course of 3 nights, this was actually a very comfortable layout.Bathroom shower pressure very good, cutains were effective at blocking out light from the sun, and the closet was nice with upscale wooden hangars. Bathroom amenities were Westin's Heavenly Bath brand, but didn't include a liquid body wash, which surprised me (used the shamproo instead). Towels were plentiful and very fluffy. As for the rest of the hotel, didn't use much of it. Had a drink one night out on the terrace of Ducca, the hotel's restaurant. Was surprisingly quiet, thought the place would be more of scene. Restaurant furniture was pretty chic and the restaurant's terrace was a nice amenity. One of the other guys ordered room service breakfast, which came very promptly, and he was satisfied. I had a package dropped off at the front desk with just my name on it, and the hotel had it sent up to the room which was nice. All in all, very pleased. Only one thing I would comment on was they put us in a room next to the service elevators, and you can mildly hear them race up and down the elevator shaft at certain times. Thought about asking for another room, but thought the moving process would be more of an annoyance than the light sound. All in all, would be happy to return."
23,2204,"Sep 3 2009 	Central Location Nice Hotel - can't go wrong!	I travel to San Francisco frequently, about 2-3 times a month, so I know most of the hotels in the SOMA and Embarcadero areas. My most recent stay was in the end of August for four nights at the Westin on Market Street. First, the location is central, within walking distance to Union Square, San Francisco Centre, Ferry Building, AT&amp;T Park, and to the public transportation systems (BART, Muni, and cable car). If you take the BART from either the San Francisco or Oakland airports simply depart at the Montgomery Station and walk about two blocks, and the hotel is right there!The check-in was also pleasant, the lady at the front desk upgraded me to a Starwood Preferred Guest room upon check-in, granted, I gave her my SPG card as well, but it was nice that she did that for me even though I didn't ask. *WORD OF ADVICE* Be nice to the front desk folks, it can payoff for you - they can either give you a crappy or nice room.The room itself was nice, spacious and clean and nice view of the SOMA district from the 29th floor! I also used the fitness center at the hotel, and thought it was nice too ... I would have to say their fitness center is better than the Hyatt Regency's or Le Merdien's ... the gold standard is still the Marriott on Fourth Street. I also dropped by the Ducca bar for drinks and appetizers and they were good - no complaints."
24,2204,"Aug 26 2009 	Nice comfortable hotel...	Affordable 4 star hotel, large rooms, great beds, in the hot spot, good service,"
25,2204,"Aug 26 2009 	Enjoyable Stay Great Room	We stayed 4 nights on the top floor, corner room, SPG member premium room with views of Union Sq,, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, Financial District and pretty much anything worth seeing. Floor to ceiling windows were great and I was up at 6 am when the sun was up to see the xuty come alive and watched the lights at night. The room was great, bed comfy and sheets good (200 thread count only though). The bathroom was very nice and the shower large enough for 2 people easily. The only glitch was that on our first night the room safe was not available as it was being serviced and did not arrive until the next day so we left our valuables with security who issued a luggage tag (a little disconcerting) as front desk do not have a hotel safe. The safe arrived the next day.Hotel staff were aloof as others have said, not unfriendly, just aloof and could have made an extra effort to smile and greet guests. The hotel was very busy including meeting rooms. We found the lounge areas even more impersonal so passed on having a drink there - opting for a few places nearby and there are many to choose from. The location of the hotel is great and this hotel does have some great weekend rates from time to time. It is a solid 4 star business hotel and suitable for weekend getaways. In my opinion is is not great for families with small children as there are no facilities for them and none nearby. There are better choices on 7th Street for families.We would stay again."
26,2204,"Aug 25 2009 	Great location nice (small) rooms sometimes crowded.	Many other reviewers have commented on the location, and it's true that it's hard to beat - convenient to Union Square, Chinatown, financial district, BART, the F line trolley. Rooms are very nice and comfortable if (like most S.F.hotels) small. The only downside I've encountered on several visits is that the hotel can be very crowded, with some annoying waits for the elevators. Aside from that, if you can book a good deal online, definitely go for it."
27,2204,"Aug 24 2009 	Horrible Customer Service	Very beautiful hotel, but very horrible customer service. We were part of the wedding held in the hotel. The public parking right behind the hotel (which is public but the hotel HAS access to) closed the doors at 11 pm (Note: No signs of the hours of operations were visible). Not only we were not able to pick up a car (because of the city laws, however as we found out later they had access to the gates) but we were not able to stay in the &quot;Boardroom which was reserved for the bridal party only until 2 am, because this was our only option for the reason that there were room available in any Hotels around. Nobody can tell me that the room with just a table and a sofa is needed at 3am and people in our situation can not just stay there because there are no other options. They kicked us out of the room and let us stay in the lobby until 6 am for the parking to open doors. Very disappointed!!! You will get what you paid for, but NOTHING extra. Hope no major things would go wrong when you stay here, no help is coming!!!"
28,2204,"Aug 23 2009 	A modern business hotel but also good for tourists	Spent 4 nights on vacation in San Francisco with my with and daughter at the Westin. It was the peak of tourist season (or so it seemed) and all of the public transportation and the restaurants were packed with out of town visitors. The concierge service at the hotel was exceptional given the near constant line at their desk and provided helpful informaiton and even got us a good deal from a local rental car company that delivered it to the hotel and allowed drop off at the airport for only a minor fee. The room was adquate for the three of us, the bath was very average but was clean and had lots of towels and other amenities. No free internet. The place looked pretty packed while we were there but it never seemed to impact the service. All and all a good place to stay. Not near the main tourist areas, so be prepared to walk about a mile to the embarkadaro or take the historic street car line, also city bus service and cable car is only a short walk. Lots of coffee shops and small restaurants nearby."
29,2204,"Aug 21 2009 	Westin Market St was FANTASTIC and Great Value	My wife and I recently stayed at Westin Market St for 4 nights. Great staff and inviting lobby. At check-in the desk clerk told us that the room that we had been assigned was more about the view than the size, with which I was fine. We arrived to our room on the 21st floor and a BEAUTIFUL view of the city! The room was lovely, clean, modern, comfortable. Large LCD TV, starbucks coffee, wonderful linens on the King-sized bed. Great location, with plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Be sure to have breakfast, lunch or dinner at Cafe Mason! Only two small complaints: 1. housekeeping forgot to give us washcloths on one day and coffee supplies on two days. Both were promptly refreshed upon request. 2. we experience a bit of problem getting our keys to work, a problem that the desk clerk told us on checkout was probably related to a low battery in the lock mechanism. Outside of that a WONDERFUL experience! We will definitely return to the Westin Market St!"
30,2204,"Aug 19 2009 	Great Location	We stayed there in aug 14th. , The hotel was nice and the location was perfect. The rooms were nice and clean and the bathroom was nice. Nothing special about the hotel but the views from the top floors were incredible. I do think the prices of room service, misc. prices - internet and local phone calls and etc.. were a bit too high.. We didnt use the internet or phone and etc.. because of the prices, but be aware if you do.. If anything I think the prices of those costs should be lowered. But besides from that it was a good hotel. I would stay there again.."
31,2204,"Aug 17 2009 	Room with a view!!!	Just returned from a perfect four day stay at the Westin with my wife. Let me start by saying the location of this hotel was awesome. We were able to easily walk to any downtown destination from the hotel. The BART station is very close (we didn't partake-we love to &quot;hoof it&quot;- burning off lots of calories from gastronomical over-indulgence). We scored a 34th floor room that had a STUNNING view- both of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate! Nighttime views were romantic to say the least. The staff were all very courteous and accomodating, especially housekeeping. The room was quite small, but very well appointed, tastefully decorated and quiet. As with all Westin's in which I have stayed, the Heavenly bed was very comfortable! Though I'm not much of a Broadway fan, my wife convinced me to get tickets to &quot;Wicked&quot; which was playing at the Orpheum theatre. I was incredibly impressed and would highly recommend this!! Great storyline and very talented performers. Also saw the long running &quot;Beach Blanket Babylon&quot;, but didn't enjoy it nearly as much even though the politcal satire was funny. Other thoughts: Starbuck's and Walgreen's across from the hotel are convenient, Dinner at Cheescake Factory (on the 7th floor deck of Macy's-overlooking Union Square) was fun for food and people watching, Embarcadero Saturday Market was lots of fun for art, crafts, food, Ghirardelli Square wasn't worth the effort (except the exercise getting there).Coming from a beautiful, clean, friendly little city in Idaho, I was surprised by the friendly attitudes of most everyone I came in contact with in SF. It was clean, safe, colorful and I hope to return very soon!"
32,2204,"Aug 13 2009 	Location! Location! Location!	Hubby and I stayed here with another couple for a quick 3-day get away. Value rating is based on Hotwire rates. We were within walking distance to AT&amp;T Park and all modes of transportation (BART, MUNI, F-Line Trolley, cabs). There was a Starbucks right across the street (an added bonus for us caffeine fiends), as well as a deli next door, a couple bakeries around the corner and CPK across the street. Drug store and 7-11 also within walking distance for last minute needs.We were on the 14th floor, so some sirens could be heard occasionally, but nothing that interrupted our sleep. The room was clean and the bed &quot;Heavenly&quot;. Bathroom amenities were high quality. The staff at the front desk were helpful and nice, guiding us out-of-towners on the best ways to get where we wanted to go.We will be back!"
33,2204,"Aug 13 2009 	Excelent Beautiful recently renovated hotel in a terrific location	My wife and I took a weekend getaway to San Fran on Sep 2008, I found this 4 star hotel in Hotwire and bought it without knowing which it was, so it was a pleasant surprise that it was a Westin; but there are many Westins... when we arrived we were amazed to know which one was it, the hotel is centrally located in the Financial District on Market street. We were within waking distance from Union Square and Chinatown, we were across the street from the Moscone center and the Yerbabuena gardens, and also a few blocks from the cable cars, as well lots of other attractions. But the best part was our room, and the hotel premises. We were on the 20th floor with a terrific view to the Financial district, to my favorite the Hobbart Building. The room was recently renovated with flat panel TV new bedding, drapes, carpet, furniture, it looked like it was never used before. The staff is professional and friendly, and this is a big city! . And I could get a great rate from Hotwire, about 100 dlls per night where hotels cost btw 250 and 300 a night. We didn't dine in the restaurant but it seems to be pretty popular."
34,2204,"Aug 12 2009 	Really a nice deal	We stayed there 2 nights and it was really nice.The bed was awesome, a large TV is available etc..The hotel is really in a busy place (you can do shopping around Market Street or go at the AT&amp;T stadium to see a baseball play without having to move your car).Unless you really want to spend $45 a day, don't use the valet parking and just use one of the (many) public parkings there are within walking distance, where you will spend $15 a day.The only drawback : Internet is not complementary and will cost you $15 / day"
35,2204,"Aug 12 2009 	clean comfortable calm and well-located	We enjoyed our stay. Clean hotel and room. Very accommodating reception desk. Comfortable bed. Nice basic nature/ natural decor. Got a deal through the internet for less than $100 a night. One young male concierge seems stuck on himself and another failed to call me back. Other than that, we were very happy with our stay."
36,2204,"Aug 12 2009 	Great value - Go to Westin website	Great hotel. Great summer value!! Walls were thin and neighbors were noisy all night! Rooms are clean and location of downtown is excellent for cable cars, and city transportation. Great pizza across the street. Restaurant too expensive. Close to ball park. . . there for the no-hitter!!!!!"
37,2204,"Aug 6 2009 	Lovely	Nelson at the front desk was very welcoming. The staff was excellent, and the room was spacious, fresh, and well stocked with the standard amenities. The view of the SFMOMA, Yerba Buena, and other city landmarks was gorgeous. Room service was very prompt, and the food (breakfast) was good. Very convenient to SFMOMA, other museums, and Union Square."
38,2204,"Aug 5 2009 	Good Service and Nice People	We liked the location of the hotel. The prices were reasonable, the service was good, and the room were nice. I really liked how close it was to Union Sqaure and SF Musuem of Modern Art. We would definitely stay again."

40,2204,"Jul 29 2009 	Excellent Location San Francisco in general is great!	The service in general was good, however the food restaurants could e improved (both quality of food but specially the service) The room was good in general the service was good too and the views from the top floors were absolutely incredible! The location was perfect, right next to Union Square! Amenities were ok but i think it could use with a pool or spa. Anyways, in general the hotel was pretty good and you can reach all you need to see from the hotel's location."
41,2204,"Jul 29 2009 	Just the ticket great location for the right rice I'll be back!	The hotel is a fab location and very close to coffee shops and shopping. Check-in was quick given that we arrived at 12.30pm but no questions asked, straight to our room. We were on the 26th floor (says he who is not great on heights) and had an amazing view of the convention centre and gardens. The room had 2 queens as booked and my only complaint with the room was the 5th pillow on both beds were dirty from previous guests and never changed during our stay. Other than that the staff were great, the Valet was very expensive and because I had an SUV they charged me an extra $15 a day which when added to the $48 parking to make it $63 a day this was a rip off. We stayed 3 nights and the car . Overall I would not think twice tell anyone, business, individuals or familys to choose this hotel  its great for San Fran standards."
42,2204,"Jul 25 2009 	Great Location Great Service	The hotel is a great location close to coffee shops, convenience stores and shopping. Check-in was quick and our room on the 27th floor had a great view of the convention center and gardens. The car valte takes a bit of time to come around and is $48/night. The health club is well-equipped and very well air-conditioned. Room service was quick and tasty (large portions). We had the breakfast buffet one morning and the price is around $24 a person, but you have plenty of options to choose from. The only word of caution would be the showers which can be very slick and there is no bath mat provided. If you would like to test your bone density its a great idea to hop in and out of the showers. The bathrooms are nicely appointed.Overall a great stay. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in the area."
43,2204,Jul 25 2009 	Great value and service	Had an awesome stay at the hotel. staff was great .. room was big and clean (got comp upgrade to King bed as well on a high floor) They have floor to ceiling windows ... and the view from the room was amazing ! Deff recommend this hotel ... ohh and must visit the Ducca restaurant for its mouth watering appitizer &quot;aurichini&quot; !!!
44,2204,"Jul 24 2009	Awesome Stay	we stayed for 4 days, and it was the best stay from all of the hotels we stayed in, worth the money, it had a big bathroom, good bedroom, great view, and the service was really good. The location was near alot of things, not near cable cars. I recommend you stay here"
45,2204,"Jul 23 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location Incredible Front Desk Manager - Eric Pasch	I am SPG Platinum member so it is always nice to get an upgraded room and amenities from some of the Starwood hotels I frequent. There are Starwood hotels that really want your business and go out of their way to treat you nice (happily the majority of them I have encountered) and then there are those hotels that do not. This Westin, run my Eric Pasch, is simply one of the great hotels that really cares about the SPG members and I applaud Eric for running his front desk with such devotion for Starwood's gold / platinum members! Besides arranging an incredible suite upgrade for me, Eric took the time to hand pick for me what he considered to be the finest Chinese restaurant in the city, within walking distance from the hotel. Eric was &quot;right on&quot; with his fabulous selection!! This Westin is perfectly located in the center of SF with easy access to most attractions. I also have the following comments about the hotel: (1) My windows were the absolute cleanest windows I have ever had in a hotel - my son took incredible photos from the room and commented that he had never seen since clean hotel room windows; (2) The bathroom was incrediblly clean and well stocked with towels, etc., (3) The bed / linens were soft, fresh and clean - just as you would want from a Westin; (4) the price of roughly $125/night was a down right &quot;steal&quot; for downtown SF; (5) The Italian restaurant in the hotel looked really neat - if I had another night there I would have loved to dine in the Venetian style restaurant; (6) the entire staff was friendly at the hotel. Once again, I want to personally thank Eric Pasch for my incredible experience at this hotel and i truly hope to be back very, very soon!"
46,2204,"Jul 19 2009 	Westin Say It Aint So	This hotel must not be corporate managed hence, I ask the question &quot;Westin say it aint so?&quot; Mouse traps outside the building!!!! Gross!!! We are locals and thought is was a great location and probably has great views for our out-of-town guests. With a name like Westin you would have never thought the windows were covered with a heavy film of 4 month old dirt! I heard the housekeeper telling another that she was ill from the cafeteria food...I believe it I had flies in my salad!! Not to mention the service in Ducca was slow and not friendly!!! Now I understand why my rates were under $100 in San Francisco. Westin you might want to reconsider or retrain this property. I just stayed in Costa Mesa &amp; Seattle...wonderful properties!!!!"
47,2204,"Jul 17 2009 	Elevator can be heard in all rooms in center of hotel	If you stay in a room near the elevator you will hear it all night. I don't mean, I think I heard something. I mean I hear it over the TV at middle volume.I think it is a converted Motel 6"
48,2204,"Jul 15 2009 	Great hotel and location	I did quite a bit of research on San Francisco hotels and neighborhoods before submitting a bid on Priceline. My work paid off because the Westin was a very nice place to stay in a good location in the city. For 60% off the rack rate it was a great bargain.When I arrived I asked to change my room type and my request was granted. I was nervous when I saw that my room was next to the elevator but unlike other reviewers I had no problem with the elevator sounds at all. It was slight background noise and it wasn't bad at all. At other hotels you'd be lucky if the street noise was as tolerable. I hate noisy hotels and I found this hotel to be very quiet over four nights.The room had a simple yet modern look with a huge window with great views. It was perfectly clean. The beds were wonderful. Often I dislike the super comfy hotel beds but the Westin beds were perfect. The bathroom was clean and a nice size as well.The hotel location was ideal. It's close to BART, MUNI lines and the cable cars. There are many restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It's a nice place to escape the tourist areas even if you are a tourist."
49,2204,"Jul 13 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed at West Inn Market Street for four nights and were upgraded to aroom that had a fabulous view over San Francisco.The hotel itself is very attractive inside and has a lovely outside bararea at the back of the hotel which overlooks a park area.The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, pointing out key places tovisit/eat etcThe hotel is a great base for transport links and is only a five minutewalk to Union Square and the shops.We would definitely recommend this hotel as a good base to explore thecity."
50,2204,"Jul 10 2009 	Awesome hotel in a great location.	Just returned from three days in SF. Stayed July 5-8. Found great rate of niteny-nine dollars on hotels website two days prior. Two queen beds. The hotel is very clean, the beds are great. We parked across the street for twenty dollars a day. Got the three day muni pass and visited Alcatraz, Golden Gate, China Town and of course, the Wharf. Easy access to public transportation. Short walk to Powell and Market to ride the cable car. No complaints about the hotel. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again for the price."
51,2204,"Jul 9 2009 	everything you might expect	Before we arrived, I noted that the parking fee is $50 a night. So, we found parking on the street, which was free because it was a holiday backed up against a Sunday. My backup plan was to go to a nearby garage that had good reviews.There was a short wait at the check-in. The lady at the counter was friendly, polite and courteous. I changed my room configuration without a problem. We checked a little over an hour before check-in time. (It was 2pm) I asked for a late checkout and she said that we could stay until 2pm without extra charge.After we checked in, I called the front desk and requested a couple of robes and also some shaving cream. The robes, shaving cream, and a shaver came up within 10 minutes.Our room was clean and nice, and the bathroom was fine. The shower pressure was okay and the heat was fine too. Our window was somewhat close to some fans outside on the roof below. (we were on the 10th floor) The fans were audible from the window but not over by the bed. I had requested a room away from the elevator and ice machine and there were no noise issues.The bed was comfortable. We used the mini-bar as a fridge, and the lady at the front desk said they didn't have microwaves.The next day we checked out through the TV, which was reasonably convenient, although I wasn't able to use the keyboard to type in my email address for the receipt. Instead I had to use the direction keys on the remote. (skip that option if you're in a hurry) We left the keys and we were off.All together, we were very happy with the experience. I give it 3 stars for value because the normal prices are not reasonable. However, we found it on priceline for $90, so that wasn't an issue for us this time."
52,2204,"Jul 6 2009 	Great	Quick stay, it was just great.In the heart of San Francisco. Very nice staff. Not a single problem worth notice."
53,2204,"Jul 6 2009 	Nice location typical Westin	I had booked via Hotwire for one Saturday night for $93. When I called the hotel a couple days prior to confirm the room, the desk staff could not guarantee a king bed but noted there were plenty of king rooms available.We checked in very late, and were told we were in a queen room. I requested a king, but was told we had been given the last room available. My husband commented to the front desk clerk that he is a Starwood Gold member, upon which the front desk clerk disappeared to the back for a couple minutes. When he returned, he upgraded us to a king room and suggested we book directly with the hotel instead of using a 3rd party such as Hotwire next time to guarantee a better room. (Of course, we realized that already. In bidding on Hotwire I had been hoping for another hotel and ended up with the Westin. We stay at Westins often, so it would have been interesting to have ended up someplace else.)The room was on a corner and had amazing views. The decor was typical Westin, except it was odd that the room lacked a sofa/loveseat--instead it had two dining chairs, which was awkward. The bathroom was ridiculously small, and they should replace the hinged door with a pocket door. Thank goodness the sink was outside the toilet/shower area or we never would have been able to get ready!This was also the first Westin I've stayed in where there were no robes in the closet. Maybe they have separate rooms for the Hotwire guests vs. the guests that book directly with the hotel?Parking in San Francisco is expensive, and this hotel is no exception. $55 per night. If you don't need a car, utilize public transit while in the city.The hotel is located in Union Square, where there is shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Note that it is in the city, so expect to hear traffic and sirens associated with the hustle and bustle of the area while you are in your room."
54,2204,"Jun 27 2009 	Lovely hotel great location effortless service - a big thumbs up!!	Loved this hotel. The check in was swift, the room was very clean and stylishly decorated. Room service was prompt and staff were extremely helpful. Location was perfect for all of the city attractions. Only one minor negative - the internet was $15 per 24 hour period, which is extremely expensive! But other than this minor quibble, the hotel was superb. A big thumbs up here!."
55,2204,"Jun 26 2009 	Fantastic rooms good location snooty bar staff	Lovely contemporary rooms, comfy beds and quality bed linens, good location but snooty bar staff who couldn't be bothered to serve you and who shut the bar whenever they felt like it rather than at the alloted time regardless of how many patrons were still in the bar. San Francisco is a cosmopolitan city but this kind of service doesn't fit with that image. This hotel could take a few lessons in service and style from its European counterparts. If there is a deal on stay there if not there are plenty of other comparable hotels with better service."
56,2204,"Jun 25 2009 	Our recent stay at Westin Market St	Hi, we have just returned from a 2 week stay at this hotel. We were very pleased with the hotel. It is in a great location for all the major tourist attractions. We booked a King room and were upgraded to a twin queen room at no extra cost. The room was a good size but the bathroom was a little compact but perfectly functional. This hotel would suit all guests. The hotel is just behind the Yerba Buena gardens where there are open concerts it is also a great place to enjoy the weather. I booked through Expedia and got a good deal. Staff are generally helpful, especially the Concierges. Had a few language problems with the bellboys. Didn't try the restaurant."
57,2204,"Jun 21 2009 	Great views from a great hotel	We stayed here 2 nights and were upgraded upon arrival to a room with a great view of the city. We got a great deal over the internet, and it exceeded our expectations. The location is ideal for accessing many of the city's tourist destinations. Park across the street for better rates ($28/day but no in/out privileges). While internet access isn't free through the hotel, there are several open and strong networks that you can use.A great, casual bar called Dave's right across the street!"
58,2204,"Jun 21 2009 	Clean tidy and a fantastic view	Stayed here while attending the Apple WWDC conference, had room on 34th floor (3rd from top floor). Room was nice and spacious and nicely furnished. Bed was fantastic! view even better - i was able to see Union square, GG bridge, Bay bridge and Alcatraz from the floor to ceiling window...Bathroom nice, but not outstanding, I am 6'4&quot; and had to bend down to get head under shower, but apart from that everything was fine. All extras in room including iron/safe/40+&quot; TV, Starbucks coffee machine. Internet a little pricy at $15/day - it still amazes me that internet access is charged for when you stay at most of these hotels... Was overall very happy with the hotel and staff were friendly also."
59,2204,"Jun 21 2009 	nice room convenient location shame abotu the noise	The Westin market St is in a great location for those wishign to explore the city. I was able to get the room for $99 on hotwire, which seemed very good for San Fran.Easy access to the trams and trolley down to fishermans warf or the Castro.The room was quite large, bathroom was well designed and also quite large. Enjoyed the big LCD TV and the ability to request a mini fridge for the room to store some drinks etc. Not sure how Westin can have such comfy beds, but loved it :)The only complaint I have about the hotel is the lack of double glazing on the windows. The traffic noise was usually not an issue, but fire trucks and ambulances seemed to go past the hotel regularly with sirens blazing."
60,2204,"Jun 16 2009 	wonderful staff. Upgraded as a great surprise.	Beds and linens were amazing. We had a corner room with a King Sized bed which we could have spent hours in. True luxury. Only complaint, no robes."
61,2204,"Jun 15 2009 	Great room great service	My wife and I stayed here on a saturday night. We found the service to be excellent, whether it was the front desk, the phone operators, or the valets. All were extremely prompt and polite. The bed was fantastic, and the room spacious, clean, and quiet.We were part of a group of about 5 rooms and everyone had positive things to say about, including my friend who went to get in an elevator and found a couple having sex in it. Good times.We paid $99 for the room and as written previously, the valet service was pretty outrageous ($54 with tax). I too thought that $14 for internet service was a bit much.For $99 a night, I'd go back in a heartbeat."
62,2204,"Jun 13 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	Great views from the 30th floor! Excellent daily cleaning service - courteous, polite, helpful, friendly. Beautiful lobby &amp; seating areas. Comfy bed. Don't like paying $15/day for internet. Room price was ok. Went for a group conference, then spent a few days with spouse touring San Francisco."
63,2204,"Jun 8 2009 	Upscale but small room	We stayed at this hotel for one night celebrate a very special anniversary at a very low rate, $99. Parking at the Westin is prohibitively expensive ($48 per day) so it's best to park elsewhere. We found the lobby to be mod and cold. We had difficulty opening the door of our room with the card key because the handle should be turned UP to open, not down. When we finally got into our standard room, we found a very small room that was dominated by the large bed. The Westin advertises &quot;Spacious rooms&quot; (we totally disagree) with a &quot;Heavenly bed&quot; (we totally agree). The pillowtop mattress was wonderful. There was a flat screen TV, perhaps 46 inches, but you had to sit on the SIDE of the bed to watch it. There were NO chairs, other than a desk chair. The configuration of the room was weird."
64,2204,"Jun 7 2009 	Absolutely stunning views and great quality for the $$$	Okay, right up front I should let you know that we stayed on the top floor with a corner room so we had 180 degree views. The view was simply ridiculous! We lived in the city for a number of years and we never saw anything like it. On one clear day we saw all the way to Alcatraz.The room was small but we didn't mind, would have liked to know that there would be no bath, just a shower but the view was worth it! I had read reviews from others that said they had terrible rooms because they booked on Priceline but we did not have that problem. Yes, we booked with Priceline, found out that it was actually cheaper to book directly with the hotel (California residents get an extra 10% off) and when we called Priceline about the price discrepancy...we actually got a refund for the difference. I was shocked!Anyhow, we specifically wanted a SOMA location to be away from the craziness of Union Square and this hotel really was convenient to all the big destinations of the city. Also public transport is nearby if you need to get around...we took Bart from SFO and it was a breeze. Although I wouldn't recommend from OAK, we did that once and it was painful.The rooms are modern, amenities are a bit frugal but a housekeeper was happy to give us whatever we needed. There is Starbucks coffee and Tazo Tea in the room for a quick one cup in the AM. Everyone we encountered was extremely pleasant and the valet even allowed our friends in park their car in the lobby while they came up to our room without any attitude.We have stayed at the Hilton near the Embarcardero (a bit dated) and the Mandarin Oriental (exquisite but in the business district and very pricey) and this fell somewhere in between. I wouldn't call this Westin property luxury necessarily but we really were satisfied with our stay since we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room. Also we didn't partake in room service or the hotel restaurant but this is San Francisco...there were too many great places to eat!We would absolutely return!"
65,2204,"Jun 4 2009 	really nice hotel in a good location	good location, cozy room, shopping store surrandeda little bitter noisy"
66,2204,"Jun 3 2009 	Nice location and clean but small rooms and service lacking	We stayed three nights (Thursday to Sunday) at a very good rate. However, after booking on indirectly through expedia, we were put in a triangle room (king bed) which was modern and clean, but small and awkward. Also, during check-in, the front desk staff were not very helpful and were annoyed that we were arriving prior to check-in. Also, upon leaving, the concierge tried to put is in a waiting limo for $45, when I specifically just told him that I wanted to take a cab to the airport (approx $38 incl. tip). Wonder if the limo is owned by the hotel, or the hotel receives commission. Other than those comments, the hotel was in a great location (Union Square and transportation to everything else was a few minutes walking distance). Room service was excellent."
67,2204,Jun 2 2009 	Fantastic location fantastic hotel	Great hotel. Great location. Staff was friendly...room was beautiful...great view.
68,2204,"Jun 1 2009 	Nice and Great Value but Small Rooms	We paid $109 for a standard room on a Saturday night--fabulous! Clean, awesome location, safe and convenient to everything. So everything else is sort of secondary. OK, so... We got upgraded to a &quot;spacious deluxe&quot; room for no extra charge and were so excited, but when we opened the door we thought maybe we were in the wrong room. So tight! Not even sure the bed was king size. The bathroom door cleared the toilet by about a quarter inch, and for the &quot;floor-to-ceiling&quot; windows, they don't tell you that the ceiling above the bed is only about maybe 7 feet high to start with, then there's some sort of built in overhang that lowers the ceiling over the window to about 6 feet. On the plus side: The bed was super comfortable, very soft sheets, and the in-room coffee and tea were awesome. Plus, we requested a fridge, bathrobes, and slippers for no extra charge. Awesome TV. Also, the front desk was really nice and gave us a 2pm checkout b/c we overslept. Minuses: A prom and some other sort of young event downstairs, so lots of teens in the lobby, a few standing around drinking out of red plastic cups. Second, the &quot;sweeping view&quot; in our deluxe room on the 9th floor was the office building across the street. Then there's the small size of the rooms (ours was maybe 8' x 10' + small closet and bathroom) and also the fact that although there was an advertised $109 rate, I had to call the 800 number to get it b/c it wasn't available online. (And the rep told me that because it says rates &quot;FROM&quot; $109, they do not always actually have that rate available. Bait-n-switch or false advertising, take your pick.Overall, we were pretty comfortable b/c we didn't need too much space, and it really is an awesome value, but I definitely felt like this hotel touts itself as a lot more luxurious than it actually is."
69,2204,"May 30 2009 	Westin SF Great Location great hotel....	We stayed at the Westin SF Market Street over Memorial Day weekend. The hotel itself is very clean and conveniently located near Union Square and the Financial District. It's a 10 minute walk to the Montgomery Street BART station. No need to get a taxi as the BART was readily available to access to and from the hotel. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Parking at the hotel is expensive, about $50 per night. We didn't eat at the hotel since there's so many other options to explore around the area, especially in Union Square (which is only a five minute walk away). Our first day, we walked all through Union Square, through Chinatown to Fisherman's Wharf. from the hotel. SF is a walking city. This hotel is located in a great, easily accessible location. My only gripe was that they charge you for Wi-Fi. Other hotels give you Wifi access for free...."
70,2204,"May 26 2009 	rooms are new and clean	stayed for 3 nights, the location is great, close to the Bart and Muni lines. Watch out for parking, they charge 48/night, right next to the hotel down the ally is city parking for 25/day but closes at 11pm and reopens at 5am, but I didn't need my car."
71,2204,"May 22 2009 	Great Location Comfortable...Great Price!!	My husband I decided to go to San Francisco very last minute and I suprisingly got this hotel for $100/nt. What a deal for a Westin I thought...there is a catch though. If you are driving there is no self park, you must valet for $50+/nt. However for 150/nt this hotel was still a great deal. Besides that I found that parking in San Franscico in general is just very expensive. Upon arrival the staff were very cordial and we even got upgraded to a corner room with a view of the city.Pros:Location (street car access)Heavenly BedsView of the cityStaff hospitalityCons:Room a bit small.Smoke detector went off every time we ironed our clothes.No swimming poolOverall I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again."
