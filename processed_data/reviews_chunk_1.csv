1,2,"Nov 17 2009 	great room layout service value-would definitely return	we stayed in a 3 bedroomed-suite which was well furnished and the staff perfect hosts. they even organised a birthday cake for my Mum (we were all there to celebrate).could organise for massages / manicures in our suite, perfect for relaxing.located in the CBD so not great for tourists but plenty of remarkably good valued restaurants nearby."
2,2,Nov 7 2009 	A quality hotel with quality service	We stayed at the Ascott Beijing this summer for 1 week in a family of 5. It is centrally located. When you are a european with kids staying for a few days it is ideal to have a fully equipped kitchen and a big Wal-Mart nearby. We had a modern and spacious apartment with a big LCD flat television. The service was really good and important for us not speaking the language: we never had to wait for a taxi and they always provided info for our directions.We would definitely return!
3,2,"Oct 16 2009 	clean rooms good location poor service	check-in:my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than 5 minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room:we had the 2 bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge TWICE before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the 4 of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the 4 days we were there. Ended up doing the laundry by hand. location:central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. 7eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast:small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa:we had massage and Chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average."
4,2,"Sep 18 2009 	Amazing find for a group that wants to stick together	We did a lot of searching before finally deciding to stay at the Ascott in Beijing. I was a bit nervous since it would be my first trip to China and I know little about the best place to stay. This ended up being the perfect choice. We had 7 people traveling together and booked the 3 room suite/apartment. We comfortable slept everyone. The 2.5 bathrooms worked well for our group. We also loved having a kitchen to be able to have a little choice about what we ate. We wish there would have been a grocery store closer by, although we made good use of the 7 eleven across the street. The in-room washer and dryer were also definitely a plus and there was plenty of space for lounging around.Some have complained about the internet. As far as wireless goes you can pick some up, but I wouldn't count on it. We did have 2 wired connections though so we just shared them and made do. We weren't in China for the internet anyway so we didn't care too much.The hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. I left my passport in the taxi upon arrival and the moment I told them they got right on top of tracking it down for me.For added convenience there is also a Subway restaurant attached to the hotel. This may sound silly to most people, but after 2 weeks in china I was ready to put something a bit more familiar to me in my stomach and that hit the spot. Across the street you can find a Chinese food restaurant that will deliver to your hotel room. We had breakfast included in our stay which was a great way to start each morning.The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the subway entrance and maybe a 10-15 minute walk to the silk market and other nearby sights. All in all the hotel was very clean and the service was great. It is a wonderful deal for how nice the accommodations are and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,2,"Sep 5 2009 	Good Value for large family - Internet connection prob not hotel's fault	Great for large families! We grabbed a large 3 bedroom for 6 adults and 2 kids. Great room - my chinese inlaws really liked the kitchen and washer/dryer. Big thumbs up from them. Large LCD tv was also in heavy rotation. Had a nice kids movie with popcorn and the works every Friday. Internet was down for several days (the hotel's guest room ISP had an issue), however the GM allowed us use of the conference center internet which was a different ISP as soon as he was aware. Prob solved. If you are looking for Casa Mia, it closed, however Annie's Italian is opening soon right across the street. I've never tried Casa Mia but Annie's is a great chain with excellent service, good value, great food. Also tried the subway and curry rest in the building all fine. Gym facilities were awesome - full Cybex, freeweights and treadmills with LCDs. The breakfast buffet actually improved during our stay, and we were asked for ideas to make it better. The kids room is more oriented towards toddlers - small ball pit and other basic toys. 5 and 8 yo with us enjoyed the pool more - decent temps and very clean. If you stay here, learn how to get to Walmart, its faster to walk than taxi, and they have all of the essentials at good prices. Everybody bought a lot of our local food souveniers there. The main lacking of this hotel is that it's not a tourist hotel. You'll have to do most of the homework on your own. Find a local guide and hire them like we did."
6,2,"Aug 17 2009	don't rely on it if you have any mission-critical deals to seal	the internet connection was not reliable at all. I was not able to connect to my US stock/futures broker to view/trade the markets. couldn't login to my airline to do an internet check in or book my seat. Other websites such as yahoo, msn messenger service were inacessible as well. the front desk tried it as well and they have no clue and no answer how to fix it. the 2 bed rooms were generally big and well equipped. had a dryer/washing machine,safe with no instructions, TV in the living room was an LCD, TV in the room was a grainy CRT Breakfast was lousy. Spread was limited and tilted towards awfuloverall - a horrible experience. Internet connection should be as essential water in the toilet . if like me you need a steady and reliable connection, avoid this place."
7,2,"Aug 15 2009 	Best place in Beijing	I travel a lot in Beijing, I've stayed in different hotel and serviced apartment and honestly this one is the best one I ever stayed. The staff is always friendly and try there best to satisfied each of your request.There is a Starbucks, a minimart and several restaurant in house, each of them can deliver food in your apartment. There is also a massage center, you can phone them and order a massage in your room.The room are just awesome, you will have more place that you never had in any hotel or even serviced apartment, the smallest room is around 100 square meter, I always stay in a 2 bedroom around 200 square meter and I always feel like at home away from home.The staff and the management are really helpfull, I really apreciate the way guest are treated.Of course I recommend this residence for family our group, but it will be suitable for people who like space and great facilities."
8,2,"Aug 7 2009 	We loved it!	We stayed at the Ascott for 4 nights, and were extremely happy with the facilities and rooms. The apartment was very large and spacious for our family of 4 and is perfect for families or 2 couples as there are 2 bedrooms (1 with a king bed, the other with a double or queen) and 2 well equipped bathrooms. The kitchen had all the utensils and dishes you needed. We did not cook but bought groceries and had breakfast and snacks at the hotel. There was even a washer and they provided packets of soap. We used the gorgeous pool area everday and there is also a steamroom and sauna. We were on a private tour so we didn't venture out of the hotel on our own but we always seemed to be about 20 minutes from the main attractions in Beijing. There is a Subway and bank machine right in the hotel. We'd recommed this hotel to anyone!"
9,2,"Jul 21 2009 	Nice apartment	Stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom. It's a home away from home. Nice apartment except for the laundry problem mentioned in the previous post. After waiting 3 hours for the first load, I learned my lesson. Don't want to spend my vacation time doing laundry, you know. Since it's a small capacity washer and dryer (loads about 12 pieces of clothing), I just selected what needs to be washed and choose the shortest wash time with about 60 minutes of drying time. That way clothes are dry not damp. do be aware that your white clothes may be stained with yellow stains, probably from the water. At least that's what my Beijing friends told me. Location wise, it's a liitle farther from most of the sights. As far as taxi drivers unable to find the location of this apartment, I think it's a common problem for travellers to Beijing. I think the taxi drivers in Beijing are notorious at overcharging visitors. I've paid between rmb15 to rmb70 on different occasions travelling from Ascott to wangfujing street and vice versa. taxi drivers in Beijing are not trustworthy. From my own experience, I can tell that it's a trick for the drivers to tell the passengers that they are not familiar with a location and they would have to make phone calls to verify. Then, they would start cruising around while the charges keep going up. This happens to me about 8 out of 10 times I took a taxi anywhere. It's a huge problem and I speak their language. Imagine someone who doesn't. Overall, I would recommend this apartment to families only. there're better places to stay in Beijing if you are single or a couple."
10,2,"Jul 7 2009 	Avoid it if you are planning to do your own laundry at this place	Stay here for 5 nights with my family after reading previous positive reviews on Trip Advisor, the Travel Channel (Beijing special with Samatha Brown), and friends. The only good thing I can say is the roominess of the place(we stayed in the 2 bedroom) and the fairly good value you get for your money. Otherwise I say avoid it! Services were extremely slow due to understaffing (I think on purposes by the management despite low cost of labor in Beijing). Waits of 30 minutes to an hour was the norm with each calls for housekeeping or repair crew to come by. CAN'T stand the poor quality of the combination washer/dryer unit inside the apartment. It takes at least 3-4 hours to do a load of laundry (wash &amp; dry) and the clothes still come out damp to wet. Have complaint to management a few times but best they can do is apologize. If you are planning to do sightseeing in Beijing (which we did for a few days), where do you even find time to spend this much time on doing laundry( and still get upset with the damp/wet cloths). Breakfast was very greasy for the Chinese items and Western breakfast items were few and skimpy. Would definitely NOT stay here again despite all the hype, location was not easy to find (taxi drivers had a hard time locating it, and had to call the hotel to get directions). Faucets on basins/tubs were hard to reach if you had to wash something (if you see them, you would know what I am talking about). AVOID!"
11,2,"Jun 1 2009 	Great Value and excellent choice for family with children	Although the Casa Mia Restaurant has closed, Ascott Beijing still serves well for families with children (since it's a serviced apt). It has a gym, a pool and a play room (for young children). The location is also quite central (next to Park Hyatt) - highly recommended for families!"
12,2,"Apr 22 2009 	Ideal for a family or a larger group	I spent six nights in a 3 bedroom apartment at the Ascott with five of my family members.Pros: Fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Spacious living/dining area. Free internet access. Beautiful swimming pool/Jacuzzi. Sauna and steam. Spacious gym with new equipments. Well-situated - Currency exchange at the desk, mini-market/Citibank ATM/massage shop on the premises, good Chinese restaurant just across the street. For grocery shopping, 2 minute walk to a 7-11 convenience store, and about 15 minute walk to a Wal-mart. About 10 minute walk to the Guo Mao subway and bus station (Be careful when you cross the road). Taxis are available at the hotel entrance. Have your destinations printed in Chinese, when you take taxis.Cons: I have no complain but one. While the housekeepers were polite and seemed earnest, the service was not up to par with what I had expected. The master bedroom and bathroom were left unclean one day. The towels and amenities (shower gel, shampoo, bathroom glasses, toilet papers, and so on) were not enough; we only had four sets of towels for six people and had to keep asking for more during the first 2,3 days. But those were not a big deal for us anyway. Just keep in mind that this is a serviced apartment mainly for long-stay expats, not really a hotel.Overall, I think the Ascott is one of the best options for a family or larger group."
13,2,"Mar 25 2009	Excellent hotel for a family	This hotel is perfect for a family staying in Beiijing. The rooms are like apartments - fully equipped kitchen and laundry. Spacious living/dining area. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were large and bright. The room is cleaned daily. Overall, very clean except some carpet stains. The location of the hotel is not bad. It is located at Guo Mao, the CBD of Beijing. Convenient for business trips. However, do not be tricked by the fact that it appears close to Guo Mao Subway station. Although the hotel is situated practically on the Guo Mao Intersection (3rd Ring Road and Jian Guo Road), the subway station is not near. The Guo Mao intersection is absolutely massive - the subway station is across the road at the South-West corner while the hotel is at the South-East corner. To cross the road you must follow the crowd - Beijing drivers and pedestrians are absolutely crazy compared to North American standards. However, they are very skilled drivers. It takes approximately 10 minutes to get from the hotel to the subway station.Subways in Beijing are very busy. If you take the subway during rush hour (morning and evening), prepare to be packed like a sardine. Having said that, the subway is beautiful, frequent, and effecient. You can get practically anywhere in Beijing with 2RMB. You can also take Public Buses - very easy and cheap. Only 1RMB cash fare. There are hundreds of bus lines that will take you anywhere you want. For long buses, get on at the middle door. There will be a fare collector on the left. For short buses, get on at the front, the bus driver has a machine to collect money. Taxis are everywhere in Beijing. But beware - even registered and official drivers will rip you off. Although taxis are very cheap compared to North America, drivers, seeing that you are not native, will trick you. Know how much the trip should cost, hold a map, make sure the driver doesn't make stupid turns. You will waste time and money if the driver tricks you. But even if you do know where you are going, the driver will simply ignore your advice and continue. Beware. Never take taxis during rush hour, especially on streets like Changan and Jian Guo. It will take forever and make you frustrated. The Hotel's amenities are very good. There is a computer for use in the lobby area (ask reception) and there is wifi in the lobby. There is a beautiful swimming pool/hot tub too. Sauna and steam is also available. A gym is also available.As for food, Beijing food is very cheap. You can eat out. But if you wish to cook, you can take the hotel shuttle to supermarkets. There is also a convenient 7-11 across the street where you can buy snacks.Overall very good hotel."
14,2,"Jan 1 2009 	Perfect for Families	Me, my husband and two sons (13 and 11) stayed at the Ascott Beijing for nine nights. Very convenient location close to a main subway line. Definately have the address printed in chinese when you come from airport as it is tucked down a side street. Driver may call hotel for direction but no problem. Taxis in front of hotel were pleniful. Nice security and we always felt safe. A couple of restaurants, teahouses and Starbucks in the complex as well as a massage place (not too good), a convenience store for milk, yogurts, cereal, pasta, soda, etc. All very convenient. EXCELLENT Italian restaurant onsite called Casa Mia. This proved invaluable when travelling with two American kids who are fickle eaters. Owner is from Italy and food is good and reasonably priced. Fresh mozzeralla pizza was GREAT (about $9.00 US). My husband enjoyed the lasagna. They will deliver up to your room which is great after a day of touring with two very tired kids. My husband and I actually went to the restaurant and ate alone while we had an order sent up to the kids in the apartment. We had a two bedroom 2.5 bathroom apartment. Very spacious and clean. Large kitchen and master bathroom were wonderful. Housekeeping was excellent. Very small clothes washer/dryer but enough for a vacation. Pool and fitness area were also excellent. Most of the time we had the pool to ourselves and there were always plenty of clean towels. Good staff at the desk."
15,2,"Nov 18 2008	Choice for Western Visitors	I stayed at The Ascott from October 24-28, 2008. We arrived in Beijing late in the evening after a day of flying. Just as previously written, the taxi driver had some diffiiculty locating the hotel. We brought along the phone number. The taxi driver called and got directions. We booked a two bedroom and it was a very comfortable and nice room. The room was large and had a full kitchen, laundry room, dining room and living area. The hotel is about a ten minute walk to the nearest subway although we used taxi most of the time. They are cheap. The hotel was very helpful in establishing taxi fees up front and coordinating out trip to Badaling. Most of the front desk staff speaks very good English. We ate at the Italian restaurant in the hotel one evening and it was very good although the waitress was a litle hesitant with her English. The owner/chef was Italian and vey helpful. There is a Starbucks and convenience store in the hotel. The breakfast was good and they had a wide variety of foods to pick from.Besides the Pearl and Silk Markets, I enjoyed the in room massage the best. We had massages in the shop downstairs and noticed they will come to room for massage service for the same price. After a day of shopping and sightseeing this came in handy. For 100 yuan or about $14.00, we had private massages in the room for one hour. It was so relaxing. Overall, a pleasant stay."
16,2,"Nov 15 2008 	Very good place for family vacations	We booked a 2 bedrooms suite through hotels.com for a stay in end october and were wery happy with this hotel.It was a key success factor of our vacations in Beijing.Our two young kids (7 and 3) had a large space in the living room to play, and thanks to the kitchen, we were able to prepare them the breakfast they liked.The washing machine was very useful, and despite the fact that the program were written in chinese.We used to get food delivered at the room from the italian and japanese restaurant that are located in the same building : it was very good and cheap, and much convenient for our tired kids.We used the convenience store of the hotel and the 7/11 to buy complementary food, such as yoghort.The swimming pool was great and clean.The location is very convenient. We rarely used the subway, as the travel time by taxi was shortened, due to the fact that traffic regulations to imit traffic were still in force. It took us only 20 minutes to go to the summer palace at 12h00!!WE even finally extended our stay. The people at the front desk were very honest, recommanding us to book through hotels.com, but as were was no more availability on the web site, we finally booked directly with the hotel.As far as we could see, this hotel is located at 5 minutes by walk of a wall mart.A very good place to recomend to all families."
17,2,"Sep 20 2008	Really Good Alternative Accomodation in Beijing	My friends and I stayed at this apartment hotel which is nicely located near a metro stop, Guomao, in the Chaoyang District. The room/apartment was two bedrooms a large living room and full kitchen with a modest size laundry room. Though the washing machine did not work. This was great for our short stay and would have been even better if we were there for a week. The front desk works just as any hotel in the ability to book tours, change currency, and get transport. A, 1 - computer, business center, with free access is also available as well as two restaurants in the building, a Subway, and a Citibank ATM. If you decide that you actually prefer to eat in the apartment rather than the restaurants there is a 7-11 down the block where you can get fixings to make an omelet for breakfast.  Two issues:* For some reason the cab drivers have a really hard time finding this hotel so if you use it make sure to have not only the address but the phone number. Every cab ride we had to have the cabbie call the hotel despite them having the card with the address (in Chinese) to get the directions. Cabbies are willing to make the call.* Second was the cab con that we had at our departure. After booking for a cab the night before for a 5:30 am pick up to the airport for Y150 we woke up to find out that the cabbies suddenly wanted Y200 because it was early and it was raining. BS, and this was something the concierge was pushing. And then they wanted to push it to two cabbies because of our luggage and wanted to be paid before we left. Hey I'm from NYC. No money up front, got to the airport and paid Y150 and we also did not agree to pay the Y10 toll though we did have to do it with two cabs. I blame the hotel because I saw the concierge take his&quot;cut&quot; from the cabbies before we left."
18,2,Aug 29 2008 	Great family hotel	This is a great hotel for a family. Our family of five booked the two bedroom/two bath suite for two weeks. It was beautiful - marble kitchen and bathrooms. It had a large dining and living area. It even had a washer/dryer. Housekeeping came daily and thoroughly cleaned our room. The gym was nice and the pool was huge. We could find a taxi easily and it is located in a nice neighborhood. The staff was also friendly.
19,2,"Jun 28 2008 	Excellent in every respect	I stayed at the Ascott for 9 nights in April this year. My stay there was excellent, in every respect:* Check-in: fast, efficient, and I was upgraded to a HUGE 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment (see photos), it must have been 200 square meters.* Location: VERY convenient, in CBD Chaoyang, 50 meters on a back road from JianGuoMen DaJie (it is basically right behind the Motorola Tower, any Beijinger will know where that is), 150 meters from the Guo Mao subway station on the Third Ring Road, 200 meters from the China World Trade Ctr. There are taxis almost always outside the hotel.Room: VERY spacious, clean, fully-equipped kitchen, separate laundry room(!), L'Occitane toiletries in the bathrooms, LCD TVs, ample closet spaces.* On-site facilities: Everything you'll need: 4-5 restaurants leasing space from the hotel: Thai, Japanese, Italian, Starbucks...I had food delivered to my room from the Italian restaurant, very good and fast.There is a mini-market on the premises with everything you might need for a short stay, a Citibank ATM on the premises(!), and a 711 2-minute walk. Great gym, huge, with nice views, looked newly renovated, new equipment, and it was empty every time I went there.I believe the pool was closed for renovation, so no opinion on that.Service: One word: excellent. Example: I'd call Housecleaning right before I'd go downstairs to the gym so they come to clean the room, I come back from the gym 1 hour later and the apartment is made up and the cleaning lady is ready to leave! In other words, immediate housekeeping on request.Tip at the Beijing airport: have with you the address of your hotel in CHINESE, or at least the phone number, so the taxi driver can call them to get the address."
20,2,"May 14 2008 	Recommended with one strong consideration	I found the comments here to be generally true when I arrived at this hotel with my husband and toddler. The rooms are huge and well-appointed. The grocery store downstairs, though small, contains many western foods which can be difficult to find otherwise as does the reasonable lobby restaurant. HOWEVER, my husband has a bad lower back and the bed was intolerable for him. Generally speaking, hotel beds are better for him but this is basically a thick futon. I thought it felt like sleeping on a hay bale. The hotel (after 3 calls and one direct chat with the guest services director) switched out the mattress to something they said was softer, but it was basically the same. We had to pack up and relocate after the first night. We are both in our late 30s and not that out of shape! Also, the pool which I specifically picked for the toddler was closed. And the staff is rather limited on English, but that seems typical in Beijing."
21,2,"Nov 4 2007 	Excellent choice for Beijing	I stayed at the Ascott Beijing for two months during Sep / Oct 2007. Rooms were spacious and generally well maintained. Of the three rooms I stayed in I only had issues with one, which were resolved without fuss.I had previously stayed at a 5 star hotel in Beijing, and the Ascott provided larger, better furnished rooms at a cheaper rate. The building housing the Ascott includes a number of restaurants and shops (Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Starbucks, Subway, a 24 hour convenience store, an ATM, ...).Large pool and gym with new equipment. Reception staff generally speak good English but other staff do not (this is standard for China). Only issue would be that I didn't find the buffet breakfast fantastic (but I am quite fussy)."
22,2,"Nov 1 2007	Didn't want to leave!	We rented a two bedroom deluxe apartment using the hotel's website it came to about $200. One of the rooms was a master bedroom, the other a regular bedroom with the bathroom across the hall (great for a family, might be an issue for two couples). The apartment had a full kitchen and a laundry room with a washer/dryer (small loads work best).The apartment was large, it was well lit and felt very luxurious.When we arrived the room was still being cleaned by a small army of maids so we spent some time at the Starbucks downstairs reading the free and very useful Time Out Beijing and That's Beijing papers. Forget about guide books, they are obsolete the moment they are published in fast changing China.The hotel's rooms are in two towers (East and West) which you can access using your room card. You also use your room card to activate the elevator. This felt very safe. There are a few restaurants, a couple of art galleries, a massage place, a convenience store and a very neat tea house in the same building.Breakfast is served in the nearby Casa Mia Italian restaurant. The website called it a continental breakfast, but it's much more than that. There are eggs, noodles, congee, vegetables, in addition to the more usual muffins and cereal.I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Problems like missing toiletries and a leaky fridge were taken care of right away. I would recommend a stay here to anyone who's traveling in larger groups.The hotel provides Internet access for an extra fee and can arrange excursions and airport transfers for you, but those are usually more expensive then doing it yourself (about twice as expensive). The Guomao subway stop is close by and can get you to Tianamen square and the Forbidden City very easily. Taxis were always available.The airport shuttles get you pretty close to the hotel (take #1 and the stop is #3 - Guomao). It's only 16 Yuan, but not very comfortable. A taxi will cost about 85-100 Yuan and is probably a better option. The airport staff is completely unhelpful and will try to sell you on tours to the Great Wall and expensive shuttle services (3-4 times what it would cost by taxi). Of course all this might change with the Olympics. Hopefully for the better."
23,2,"Sep 18 2007 	Absolutely delighted with this hotel!	I wasn't looking for an apartment - just somewhere I could fit 2 adults and 2 kids without having to pay for 2 hotel rooms. We paid the special rate of 888RMB nightly for the Ascott Beijing, booked on the Ascott website. The location was very good - you could walk to shops &amp; restaurants, or it was easy to get a taxi. The Silk Market was walking distance.The apartment itself was divine - one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen &amp; laundry. It's obviously set up for expats who stay long term. After the tiny room we had in Shanghai, this was an absolute delight. We arrived early and paid an extra half day to check into our room early. Then it seemed a pity to leave it for the next five days, but clearly we did because we managed to cover its expansive spaces with shopping."
24,2,"Apr 9 2007 	Ok - but Service can be frustrating	My family (wife, 3 kids, in-laws) spent four nights in a 3BR apartment at the Ascott in Beijing. The room was decent, although clearly fraying around the edges with worn carpet. The room is in need of updating. Quite inexcusably, we were put in a 3BR apartment in a wing of the hotel where the other apts. were being renovated. So during the day we had workmen walking up and down the halls and we returned each day to the smell of fresh paint in the area.The biggest problem is that the service is not up to par. For example, when we checked in, we only had 4 sets of towels in a 3 BR apartment that sleeps at least 6 people. Not sure if they think you're going to take turns or something. When we asked for more towels, they brought two sets up and asked us to sign for them (never had that happen in a hotel). When we asked for some additional sets (we like to have extras on hand), both on-duty housekeepers came up and told us we more than enough towels and that we could exchange towels, not get additional sets. At one point, they accused us of wanting to steal the towels.After engaging the front desk, we finally got a few extra sets of towels, but it clearly wasn't worth the hassle. We had other minor problems throughout the stay. While we enjoyed the extra space, the kitchen and laundry facilities and the price was relatively inexpensive, in some ways it was more hassle than it was worth."
25,2,"Nov 1 2006 	Good value but watch the beds!	The Ascott Beijing is perfect for those wanting to stay in a service apartment in the city, and for the added space you pay hardly anymore than for a hotel room. The Ascott is well appointed with large rooms and comfortable open spaces. It is also well situated in the Guo Mao area with a line of taxis behind for easy travel (easy being relative because as soon as you leave the hotel by taxi you enter the city's increasingly horrid traffic).The Ascott also had an indoor pool which is useful in the cooler months and a good gym. There is even a massage centre right down stairs (not run by the hotel but they are permitted to go to your room).The only issue - albeit an important one - I had with the Ascott Beijing was the quality of their beds - they were were just too hard. And when I say hard its not a matter of too firm, but actually too hard! You don't feel like you are getting any support which leads to unfulfilling sleep. For a service residence of this caliber this is certainly a disappointment and a reason why I may consider staying at the Ascott Beijing again. My rating for the hotel would otherwise be a &quot;5&quot; or excellent."
26,2,"Oct 2 2006 	want a convenient alternative to a 5 star beijing hotel?	traveling to china four times annually since year 1998 and staying at 4 and 5 star rated hotels in beijing, i tried the ascott in 2003 as an alternative. the ascott provides the leisure and business traveler a refreshing alternative with the bonus of twice the floor space of a western style hotel suite. another attraction is the ascott's location. it is situated in the most desireable area of beijing known as choyang or the central business district where the center of government, shopping, and branded hotels are domiciled. the ascott may not have the name recognition of the western chains...yet; but if you need high speed internet, a convenient location, english speaking staff, and a spacious accomodation, you will be pleasantly surprised with this hidden jewel."
27,2,"Jul 7 2006	Pretty nice place	I just stayed at the Ascott with seven of my family members in June 2006, and we all thought that it was pretty nice. This is not really a hotel; it's a serviced apartment. So, it is meant to be used long-term by business travelers. The benefit for short-term travlers is that the Ascott has several different apartment configurations, and it is one of the few options in Beijing (that I know of) where larger groups can stay comfortably. We rented two apartments, each of which had two bedrooms and two bathrooms (1800Y a night). The apartments were tastefully decorated with full kitchens (granite countertops, stainless appliances, etc.). The service was very good, and the location is convenient -- behind the Motorola Building on the intersection of Jianguomen and Third Ring Road, kitty corner from the World Trade Hotel and the Guomao subway station. There's a Starbucks in the same building, and there are several places to eat. A Minsheng Bank is located right across the street from the lobby, which has an ATM machine that takes all the cards, and there is a 7-11 about 30 yards down the street -- nice when you need cold beer or water at all hours of the night.Like many other properties in China, the quality of workmanship in the hotel rooms leaves something to be desired -- uneven grout lines, messy caulking, etc. If you've stayed at other hotels in China, you know exactly what I mean. This would be my one reservation about the place, but it didn't seem to bother people in our group. In other words, it's not a five-star hotel, but it's trying hard. The place still provides one of the best options for larger groups of people (On this, I agree with the earlier poster.). If you're interested, you can find photos online at the Ascott's website, which provide a reliable idea about how the apartments look."
28,2,"Nov 9 2005	Fantastic apartments	My family recently returned from a 10 day tour in China - our 4 days at the Ascott Beijing made for a fantastic finale. We got all the creature comforts of a hotel (nice furnishings, linens and maid service) combined with the privacy and space of a large apartment.We were a mixed group: two grandparents, three grandsons (11, 9, and 8 yrs old), their mom and me (the auntie). After 6 days in hotels and staying in 3 separate hotel rooms - with frequent calling between rooms to get organized for breakfast, dinner, etc - this luxurious apartment set up was a welcome change (and about the same price). Our 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom apartment seemed new and extremely clean. There was a washer/dryer combo, but it was so slow that it was just better to send our laundry out to a service. The kitchen was well appointed &amp; we could easily prepare our meals - the maid service helped finish up the dishes we inevitably left behind each morning.For the kids, the big pool and hot tub were a blast - a much needed energy release every day. Very clean &amp; pretty with big towels. For younger children there is a babypool, a playroom and for adults a nice gym.The breakfast buffet that came with our room rate was not all that great, but we went a couple times anyway. Plus, it was fun to see some of the ex-pat families that basically live at the Ascott.The location was pretty good, with a nice 'western' style market within walking distance. I would highly recommend this hotel/apartment building for travelling families or groups. It was so much easier to communicate and coordinate, that we were more relaxed for the touring (and dealing with the terrible Beijing traffic)."
1,3,VERY NICE HOTEL	We get vacation every year after my wedding. But up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for 4 months we choose Asia is our destination First stop in Beijing we stayed in this hotel.Hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. We liked this and enjoyed it.
2,3,"Nov 19 2009 	A fantastic hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square."
3,3,"Sep 11 2009 	nice place to stay	The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals."
4,3,"Dec 14 2008 	Reccomended	This is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit."
5,3,"Nov 10 2008	an oasis in Beijing	Just got back from Beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in Beijing, just next door to Tian'anmen Square. This inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like 50 years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the Great Wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old China - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested!"
6,3,"Nov 1 2008 	Lovely traditional style hotel	This is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just 5 minutes walk away from Tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. The girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. Since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) It's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in Chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. We were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to North Korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. On our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. I booked, as I usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required."
7,3,"Aug 25 2008 	Living it the Beijing way	As I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2007, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way."
1,6,"Nov 4 2009 	Disappointed	The hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price."
2,6,"Aug 1 2009 	good value	The hotel is a well located good a/c quality 3 star hotel, a fact that should be remembered when evaluating ratings. It is easily accessible to all the places you will want to go. Taxis are cheap as are the buses. Get the hotel to write down the name of where you want to go and take the hotel card with you. Pleasant courtyard to sit around with access to the coffee shop, but beware the price of coffee. Good breakfast in upstairs dining room - asian and american and lunch buffet for $8. There is a good massage establishment in the hotel."
3,6,Jun 22 2009 	would look at other hotels	This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean.
4,6,"May 31 2009 	Clean room friendly staff..satisfied	My husband and I recently stayed at the Dong Fang for 3 nights and although we cannot comment on its location--we had transportation organized for our whole stay--I must say the room was clean and provides the basic necessities. My major disappointment was the bed..I love a soft bed and unfortunately the bed was of typical Chinese form--not very soft.As for the staff, they were always smiling and always very helpful. We were content with their level of English.As for the breakfast that was included with our package, it wasn't bad..for all the health buffs, I think it could be a problem but for us it filled our stomachs before a long day of tours, no complaints!Be warned that the walls are a bit thin..was woken up at one point by some noise next door, but it didn't ruin our trip. Something to consider **wink wink**Overall, we had a pleasant stay. Have no regrets considering this was an on the spot choice without any research."
5,6,"Oct 21 2008 	Nice hotel	We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street. To go to the airport we caught a taxi which we preordered at reception."
6,6,"Jul 15 2008 	Comfortable hotel good location	We stayed at the Dong Fang Hotel in Beijing for three nights at the beginning of a China tour. The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience."
7,6,"Jun 27 2008	Loved the Dong Fang!	This was our last stop on an organized tour through Shanghai, Xi'an and finally Beijing. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and spoke enough English to successfully communicate with a diverse group of travelers who spoke heavily accented French/German/Russian/Australian/etc. English.Also, the daytime assistant manager is a handsome and charming Jet Li look-alike.Great place-will stay again!Beiing is the best!"
8,6,"Mar 29 2008 	Nice New Hotel	We stayed at the Dong Fang for a couple of days as part of our tour package with the Great Wall Marathon (which was an incredible experience, I would recommend to even a non-runner). My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic &quot;hutongs&quot; and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos!"
9,6,Mar 19 2008	great hotel	We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2008 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats. How they are going to compete in the olympics is beyond me.
10,6,"Mar 8 2008	Nice hotel a bit far out though	Nice hotel, rooms very modern &amp; clean, breakfast lovely &amp; a good choice, surrounding area is a few shops &amp; restaurants, nice coffee shop in the hotel itself. A bit far out to visit all the sights, we were in an organised tour which was great, but independantly it's a bit far out.Had a room on the 12th floor which was fab, offering lovely views over the city. Fairly quiet as high up apart from the end of Chinese New Year!!! It was fantastic &amp; we were treated to fireworkds and firecrackers all over the city!"
11,6,"Feb 2 2008	Average But Nice And Friendly	This was the first hotel we stayed in as part of a trip with Voyages Jules Verne. We arrived on Friday 25th January 2008 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around 16.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half."
12,6,"Dec 24 2007 	Not great	We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The bed was very hard, could have slept on the floor. Bed linen and pillows smelled of smoke. Hotel staff were not friendly although the doorman was good.Room was not over clean. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range to choose from the buffet.Would not stay at this hotel again."
13,6,"Nov 25 2007	A comfortable place to stay with a good bar	this is a comfortable and clean 4 star hotel centrally located in Beijing although, given the size of the city, it's still a taxi or bus ride from the sights. Friendly staff and a pleasant coffee shop which is in an older part of the building has lots of character. Distant views from the higher floors of Beijing through the smog. There's a good variety of European and Chinese foods for breakfast and the cafe, named 1918 after the date the original part of the hotel was built, doubles as a great bar. Check the address carefully to make sure you have the right hotel as there are a few DongFang hotels as it means dynasty in Chinese."
14,6,"Oct 22 2007	great hotel exceeded our expectations!!!	This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!! We were able to check in at 8am after an overnight train journey from Shanghai.Staff were helpful and friendly although not all spoke fluent. English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2008 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience! If you are very brave you can try scorpion!!!!We hope to return to Beijing and would stay at The Dong Fang Hotel again."
15,6,"Jan 20 2007	Ok only	This hotel is ok. It can use a bit of updating. Somewhat clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with both western and chinese styles. Guests were allowed to smoke in the dining room. Internet access in the business center on first floor (RMB1/minute). Hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Merry Mart Supermarket where you can get your supply of bottled water, snacks and other essentials. There are some non-legal cab drivers hanging out outside the hotel. Be sure to get one who uses the meter. It costs RMB15 to get you from the hotel to Wangfujing street (Tiananmen Sq and Forbidden City). Same vice versa. If the driver quotes you a fixed price, find another cab! They can be quite pushy. The hotel apparently does not discourage illegal cabbies from trying to get customers inside the hotel."
16,6,"Jul 6 2006	The Beijing Dong Feng Hotel	I recently stayed at the Beijing Dong Feng Hotel as part of my Exodus Adventure trip and it exceeded my expectation.The hotel has recently been refurbished. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious with fresh towels everyday.There was also a buffet breakfast every morning including fresh fruit, juices, eggs, sausages, toast etc and tea and coffee.The staff were friendly and it has a great location. Not far from all the main sights in Beijing. I would stay here again."
17,6,"May 29 2006	Beijing Dongfang hotel was reasonable 	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Great Wall Marathon group. All rooms being totally refurbished and while still 3 star, is good. location is a relatively short walk or a very cheap taxi to Tianemen Square. Good breakfast included in our price. Staff can speak some english."
18,6,"Mar 4 2005	Simple but ok hotel	The Dong Fang Hotel was included in my trip. Lobby is nice. Hotel rooms are simple (outdated) but clean. Employees where friendly, had no problems. Breakfast was simple (in western restaurant). Stayed for one week. Location is perfect, walk in about 30 minutes to Tiananmen Square / Forbidden city. Taxi to centrum will cost you about 1.5$ in 10 minutes from the Hotel. TV with 2 English channels (HBO and ?).Overall: Ok hotel to stay but rooms are simple, if you have a choice maybe go to a higher standard one.R.P. / Netherlands"
19,6,"Dec 3 2004	Okay Hotel but hookers everywhere?!	I stayed in the Dong Fang Hotel, Beijing around a month ago (20th October) for several days. The lobby is quite decent initially and overall the hotel seems good, however on closer inspection the hotel is quite dirty, the rooms were not very nice at all. However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor. Yet they were both quite clearly brothels, though once again perhaps this is typical in China but was slightly unerving for me."
20,6,Oct 29 2007 	waren positiv berascht!!
1,7,"Nov 19 2009 	Pretty good	Very low price, and a decent hostel.Located in the famous hutongs in the middle of old Beijing (like 1-2 km south of Tiananmen Square). A 10+ minute walk to reach Hepingmen subway station."
2,7,"Oct 7 2009 	ideal location for everwhere in Beijing	My wife &amp; I stayed there in September for 2 weeks room 417 in the main hotel. Room quite large and what a relief to have a first class shower. towels and bedding changed regulary.Only down side was storage space for clothing but no big deal. Ask at reception to write down in chinese where you want to go. Also for a card to give taxi drivers to show them where you want to get back to.We thought the breakfast was far to dear. but did not miss it. Food in surrounding restaurants fantastic and so cheap.20 mins walk from Tianamen square if you can resist the temptation not to wonder into the many shops on the way.Then through the square to the forbidden city.Also 20 mins walk from The station at Hepingmen. Train fares 20 yuan (20p UK) to anywhere. Unbelievable! Very easy to use and a tourist train map can be had there for free.We managed to get to most sites by train even though taxis were very reasonable, make sure they put their meters on and beware of any tut-tuts which will trick you ( they say 18 ( 1.80p)and when you get to destination swear blind they said 80...(8.00p) each)We also took a bus to the Zoo 20yuan and about an hours drive very interesting.I would highly recommend this hotel for a clean room, excellent service ,and helpful staff Ideal for any one who wants to save money for the excellent shopping to be had around."
3,7,"Aug 19 2009 	Good hostel in Beijing hutong	Beijing was my last stop on a three-week trip to China. I stayed at far East for 6 nights and would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. After staying in a variety of places, Far East seemed adequate, although a bit pricey for the private rooms based on my other experiences. I chose the hotel for its location, which was convenient - near the subway and Tian'anmen (10-15 walk to each). The hostel is located in a hutong, which I really enjoyed seeing. I'm surprised that I saw several comments here about people not feeling safe in the area and being grossed out - hello, it's a fairly poor neighborhood in a developing country. I never had any issues or felt threatened in any way, and there are people still out selling fruit late at night so it's not at all desolate, plus there are several other hostels located nearby. The hotel istelf is fine - nothing fancy, with rather grim communist decor, but cleaned well every day. One negative is that no cab drivers knew where the hotel was, even with the Chinese map. When I arrived, the cabdriver had a difficult timetrying to drive through the narrow streets which were blocked by a bunch of bikes parked in the way. I ended up just getting dropped off on the main drag and walking into the hutong since it was less bother and probably quicker."
4,7,"Jul 19 2009 	Would stay here again!	We stayed here for 4 nights, traveling with another couple and their teenage son. We stayed in the hotel part and found it more than adequate. Rooms were simple but very clean and comfortable, the shower was great, and we all especially liked the restaurant. Hats off to the chef here! The breakfast buffet was very good, but, as with other hotels, we felt the 50RMB was a bit steep considering other meals we had there were more like 18-25 RMB.We booked the 10k Great Wall hike through the hostel....convenient as it leaves from the hostel. (if you're in good shape, don't miss this!)The hostel is within walking distance of many of the traditional tourist sites and we loved the fact that it was located in a hutong area. It's nice that they have several computer areas...lobby, coffee/bar area, and 2 in the restaurant.We would stay here again!"
5,7,"Jun 16 2009 	Just what we needed	Great location, clean, friendly, well-priced. This place is not a five-star but a perfect base for exploring Biejing area attractions. Stayed 5 nights with my wife, teenaged daughter and father-in-law. Very comfortable and safe. Good neighborhood with easy access to buses and taxis. 20 minutes walk to T-square and Forbidden City. I'd recommend it to anyone.Didn't try the restaurant as we ate in local cafes for variety. There are a couple of convenience stores next door for everything from cold beer to a ride to the airport."
6,7,"Jun 11 2009 	Cheated	I was greeted by a scowly faced male receptionist who was servicing another guest. That guest had asked him if they had wireless service. The scowly faced receptionist didn't seem to hear or understand the guest''s question so I answered by pointing out to him another traveller who was in the lobby with his laptop. He seemed to have a wireless connection.I thought that if this staff person didn't understand a customer's question in English, then what are the chances of the other staff speaking better English than this guy? Even when I presented my American passport this guy continued to speak to me in Chinese.I also had to book a train ticket to Nanjing for June 9th. Since one staff person poorly demostrated his English speaking skills I decided to try and book a ticket in Chinese. It was June 6th. I wanted to leave Beijing on the 9th but I didn't have the money. I said that I would pay her on the 7th. She insisted that I pay her now. So I went out to an ATM, got the funds, and paid her that day. I thought everything was ok until I returned from sightseeing the next day. I had not gotten the ticket yet and was wondering when I would get it. It was around 7 p.m. when I enquired about this.&quot;You were suppose to leave TODAY (June 7th)at 4;30&quot;What? Bullshit! I said that I was going to pay on June 7th, NOT LEAVE on the 7th. She, however, continued to argue with me and thus blaming ME for giving her faulty information. So I asked for a refund. She called the Beijing Railway Station to see if that was possible. I paid 324 RMB for a sleeper and I really didn't want to pay for another ticket. Unfortunately the train had already left and I could not get my money back.So in my customer review I wrote a loooong note telling management what happened and that I should at least have a partial refund of my hotel stay because of this woman's bad customer service behavior. They read my review but all I got was a &quot;if-you-have-a-problem-come-talk-to-the -manager&quot;response. I never did get my money back."
7,7,"May 21 2009 	Good location more like a budget hotel than hostel	BFEIYH is a hotel that has been converted to a youth hostel. It's tricky to find the first time as it's amidst a Hutong but that certainly has appeal as it gives you a bit of traditional Beijing close by. It's a decent budget option but nothing special.The only thing I would warn against is the agents that work within the hostel. While they are very helpful and friendly, you can easily beat their prices by popping to one of the many agencies nearby for air tickets/trains/attractions"
8,7,"May 7 2009 	Good option for Beijing on a budget	The Far East has a hotel and a hostel. We stayed at the hotel. Upon arrival the receptionist wouldn't allow us to check in because she perceived a problem with my husband immigration status. We were really upset because she was rude and wouldn't concede that probably she didn't know as much and the immigration agents of her country who had allowed us into the country at the airport and stamped my husband's passport! Finally we were given our room but only after a long discussion when all we wanted was to go to bed after a transcontinental flight. Later the manager apologized, but still I was really upset. The room was big with two twin beds. No frills. The advantage was that right across the street there was a tour agency which we later found out offered the same tours at a much lower price than the rest of the agencies around the city. So if you're on a budget this is a good option you just need a little patience."
9,7,"Apr 24 2009 	Good Hostel/Hotel	We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2008. We liked that it was really close to Tiananmen Square and that it was cheap (around 30 USD a night). We booked a private double room.The hotel is located in a hutong or an alley. Looks shady at first but it was totally fine. Its great coz youre really close to good food and fairly cheap food at that. The rooms were pretty basic, no frills or anything but has a small TV. There's a bar/cafe/internet cafe downstairs and a convenience store where you can buy water and snacks and such. There was also a laundry facility and a full restaurant in the building. A booking tour agent is also available, which was great, for Great Wall tours, city tours and tickets to Chinese Opera.This is definitely an adequate backpackers hotel/hostel. The only downside I can think of is that it's not really close to the subway station but it is walking distance to the main Beijing sights - Tiananmen square, Temple of Heaven, and even one of the Opera theaters. I'd probably stay here again."
10,7,"Apr 10 2009 	Beautiful place	The hostel is situated within Beijing's traditional hutongs which adds to it's character. The hostel itself had a beautiful traditional courtyard with a friendly atmosphere. The cafe is excellent with a variety of food, I actually got addicted to french toast there! But there is chinese food as well. The hostel is close to one of the main metro lines and has a variety of shops and restaurants near-by there is also bike hire if you can brave the Beijing traffic! It is clean and friendly and the staff all speak excellent English."
11,7,"Jan 23 2009 	really hope this place doesn't change	This hostel rocks!I stayed in the hotel the first night of my stay- called them direct from Japan using the phone number found in my Lonely Planet guide and had no problems communicating and securing a room.However, when I got there the hotel room was fine but a real non-event. I wandered over to the Hostel part of the property across the road and instantly realised that was where I wanted to be... I booked a dorm bed for the rest of the week and moved there the next day.What can I say? I have such fond memories of my 5/6 days at the Far East, I met some lovely people- the courtyard is such a lovely, communal meeting space and everyone there so open and friendly, and you never felt lonely there although if you wanted your own space people were understanding. It was my first time travelling alone and I loved it. My experience in the hostels in Thailand and Europe had prepared me for huge groups of 18 year olds screaming. There was none of that, people seemed a bit older, a lot of people were travelling alone or in couples so naturally a lot more open to making friends.Yes, the area can feel a bit 'run down' but it is so full of character: you can get a real sense of the China that is slowly being trampled upon by the big bucks of commercialism.Liulichang is close by- a beautiful street and the best place to spend your yuan. The amazing book shops have a wealth of chinese pen and ink prints and illustrated books- beautiful gifts or souvenirs. If you carry on down you get to the smaller shops and stalls which sell a variety of stuff, including some of the tourist tat you'll find elsewhere but with a lot more choice and some better quality stuff. The tea shop at unit 88 (hope it's still there) sold the most amazing jasmine and lychee tea. I lost the woman's card and will forever regret it as she said she shipped overseas. Anyone with this info please get in touch.I actually went here in 2004, but I couldn't choose that (understandably).I've heard that this hostel is still standing and doing a great job, but I thought I could contribute my tuppence worth as I really recommend it.Yes, the bathrooms weren't always clean, but apart from that no complaints."
12,7,"Nov 7 2008 	I arrived tried smelly and hungry; I left rested fed and smelling of jasmine!	This is definitely not a hostel. It is a lovely hotel in the most wonderful area in what is possibly the friendliest city in the world.Service was prompt and professional; rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. The water was hot and the air-con worked.If I ever return to Beijing I will stay at the Far East International Youth Hostel.P.S. Watch out for the tea-house scammers when exiting the Forbidden City"
13,7,"Oct 28 2008	Perfect location and base for exploring Beijing	We stayed there for four days some weeks before the olympics. We could not have hoped for a better location! Smack in the middle of the charming and busy hutong, one of the few hutongs that were open to us (visible, at least, and not destroyed because of the olympic games). And just a short (and exciting) walk to the Tiananmen Square.Our rooms were nice for a hostel, we had everything that we needed. We only got to try the breakfast buffet once (we were to busy exploring the night life to get up early for breakfast), but it was great, with a lot of fresh fruit, many different kinds of juices, and much more.In the immediate surroundings of the hotel, men, women and children were outside drinking tea, playing chinese chequers (or so it looked to us), having a quick wash (!) in the hutong. Fantastic. And restaurants everywhere, with great and cheap food.We originally thought that we could manage everything by ourselves, but still found it a great advantage to have a functional tourist office in the building, where we bought tickets for climbing the wall, acrobatics, and airport taxi. I am definitely staying here if I ever return to Beijing. We loved it!"
14,7,"Aug 6 2008 	Luvd it	I was recommended this place by someone in XI'an .I got there and hated the beds but loved everything else.Could not have gotten a better experience into every day chinese life.I ate steamed and fried dumplings every morning down the road and spent all night wondering the allies alone while my girl slept.Safest place I have ever been and the people are great.I would live in this area if I could , and the Hostel staff was jam up and I really love Miss Shen who is in charge of the travel office.I say if you don't mind hard beds , stay here as long as you can .Its near everything too and easy to find being its so close to Tiananmen."
15,7,"Jul 18 2008	Good value nice location (if your taxi can find it)	A good, central choice for the price. Clean, reasonably sized rooms, lobby shop, decent breakfasts, and pleasant basement bar with internet access. The hotel also runs the youth hostel opposite, which has a nice cafe attached. Not sure much English is spoken, but staff did their best to be helpful. The hutong location is very quiet and pleasant, a short walk south of Liulichang and a little further from Hepingmen metro station (and a handy Bank of China branch) - you can walk to Qianmen/Tiananmen easily. The only problem was that despite the map cards issued to all guests, some of my party who didn't speak Chinese had trouble getting taxis to locate the hotel, and some taxis refused even to try and find the place. But I'll probably take my student group there again despite that, mainly for the location and the bar. NB: only cars and motorbikes can get up the narrow street to the hotel, so tour groups using buses will have to carry their bags from the main road."
16,7,"May 15 2008 	Clean rooms great location for a budget price	The Far East Hotel (Youth Hostel) is about a 15-20 minute taxi ride (cab fare Y20) from the Beijing West train station. It's located in a hutong that is currently undergoing some major refurbishment. Don't expect to be walking in the streets dust-free! Check into the main hotel on the right despite the website putting up a picture of the older style building.The twin rooms were clean, the bathroom was a bit slippery when wet. There is no bath/shower partition. Toilet and shower is all in the one space. There was enough hot water for two people. The staff were friendly and checking in was problem free. Just be aware that the card key you get with your room should be facing up with the picture side down.Across from the Hotel is the Traveller's Cafe which is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Order the French toast! It's great especially if you've just spent many hours on a train. You can book tours from the hotel. We booked a tour to the Great Wall for (Y300) per person for a private car. No guide was necessary.The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and about a 45 minutes walk to the Temple of Heaven. There are lots to see and explore even in the hutong where the hotel is located."
17,7,"Feb 10 2008	It was ok for the price	It was a decent hotel. It didn't cost a lot so I didn't expect a lot. I thought it was a very clean place to stay. My main complaint was that the beds were literally the hardest beds I've ever slept in. And the pillows badly need to be replaced. Other than that, the hotel staff is decent."
18,7,"Nov 1 2007 	2 week stay in this hotel	What an experience this hotel was. Felt completely at home.I have seen all the different rooms. The cheapest twin bed room, the one I was in, is the best. Small, and really not much to look at, butits a place to sleep which is all I'm using it for. I did not find any of my sheets to be dirty as others have complained. Saw maybe some water spots near the AC vents. Bathroom was more like a walk-in shower with hot water at all hours. The room has a fridge and a TV. My only complaint is that the beds are hard and after 7 hours of sleep I would start to feel pressure points and find myself constantly tossing. The so-called deluxe rooms were exactly the same as the standard room except they had a wooden floor instead of a carpeted floor. Waste of money. And the so called four bed room is just a room in the basement of the hotel with bunker beds, so do not get fooled booking one of these because it is a ugly spot in the hotel.The restaurant was awesome. It served Chinese and Russian food. I'm hungry right now just thinking about it. The waitresses and kitchen staff knew when I would come to eat for lunch and dinner like clockwork, so it must have been good. The breakfasts in the morning, however, were simple servings of eggs and ham and cereal and muffins.No bacon and hash brown in China, I don't think. The coffee was good but try the Black Tea as well. Excellent.For the most part the staff was nice. My family in another room had problems with the sink and the staff came immediately to unclog it. I remember during the China new year they came into everyone's room serving people mooncakes. They provide tours, but I didn't look into them. Service in the restaurant was great. The guy who did peoples laundry was easy to deal with. There were a few troublesome staff members, though. There was a girl in the cafe bar below that sighed and gave me a tired look when I asked for coffee. Chinese often wheretheir emotions on their sleeve so it didn't bother me much. (By the way, there is a big screen TV and a selection of DVDs people can choose from in the cafe, which was cool.) One time I asked a staff member to help me find a restaurant I was interested in, but since she didn't know the English name and I didnt know the Chinese name, she asked, &quot;Why don't you give it up?&quot; So don't expect the best service here, but it sure is not bad for what little you pay for it. (I watched these people put in 12 hour shifts and never seen them having a day off for the two weeks I was there, so I would be grumpy too.)The absolutely best thing about this hotel other than the price is that it is right in the middle of a busy Hutong full of things to eat and buy. Its just minutes away from a bank to cash in travelers cheques and from the Quan Jude Restaurant. You can literally spend a day just walking the old streets surrounding the hotel (some of whichare quite beautiful, just have to look for them) with stores full of art and antiques and statues and weapons and everything Chinese. It is also near Tian'anmen Square, Forbidden City and Tiantan Park. The friendship Hospital is also nearby, which caters to Westerners. A doctor there cured &quot;my allergies&quot; with some herbal medicine (I'm not kidding!) which no doctor here could ever do, so I would make note of THAT on your trip to Beijing. The Wangfujing shopping district is also nearby. Some Taxi drivers will deny knowing where this hotel is, so just tell them to take you near Quan Jude (not even a city block away) and guide them to the entrance area of the Hutongs where the hotel is. Its easy to remember this whole location once you see it."
19,7,"Oct 27 2007 	Great! (considered the price)	Not expensive! Rooms are ok (bathroom can be a little more clean). Everybody (exept clean-lady) speaks english. Close to city highlights. In a really chinese neighbourhood (you have to like it, I really did. You can book all kind of (day)trips in the hotel. Very convenient and not too expensive."
20,7,"Aug 9 2007	A Well Run Youth Hostel in a small Neighborhood	We read good things about this hostel and it looked like our best bet in Beijing. We came in from the train station by subway and headed down the main road from the subway stop. We weren't sure which street to turn down but the residents saw our suitcases and assumed that we were heading to the hostel. Along our walk people made sure we turned down the right streets. It is also a tall building and easy to spot when we got close.  The reception desk was friendly and spoke English well enough. The lobby was quite fancy looking which was reassuring. They has a travel desk which we didn't use (we just used Lonely Planet's advice instead) but it is available.  They have a small shop selling snacks and a good restaurant. The buffet breakfast was not included in the price and was a little expensive by Chinese standards, but it was a huge spread and lots of western dishes if you prefer those. The restaurant has good Chinese dishes for dinner at very reasonable prices. Beer is super cheap and they have movies playing every night. They have two free internet kiosks and wifi is available for free in the restaurant. Just know that a lot of western news sites are blocked thanks to the Chinese censors. We stayed in the 6 bed dorm rooms and found them clean with clean linen and a table to work at. All our roommates were very nice.  We found the hostel very well run, like everything was planned out ahead of time to make it a smooth experience for the visitors. When we went to do laundry there was a girl staffing the room to make sure we could figure out the machine and not break it. The shower rooms were great, lots of hot water, clean and they even have heat lamps over the changing areas so you aren't cold when you get out. One design flaw is that the shared toilets (for the dorms) are all the way down the hall and the toilet paper is kept in the shower room. They need a toilet paper holder where the toilets are! The women's toilet is good but the men's toilet is a bit stinky. They need to remember that men pee all over the floor and it needs to be cleaned more often. Some reviews complained about the neighborhood but we thought it felt safe and the neighbors were friendly enough. Buildings are always being torn down because China always seems to be rebuilding everything. I think if what you are looking for is a very cheap but well run hostel, this place is a great. It is a great pick for those on a budget. In the winter the courtyard rooms are closed (it is freezing) but the main hotel was open and warm (a big plus when the temperature is so cold outside)."
21,7,"Mar 4 2007 	Didn`t like that!	there were several good things about that: the central location, not so expensive and the cheap restaurant (which you can otherwise find all over the city). the reception lady could speak English (at least!! after the 4star hotel where nobody could not understand anything in English!) the negative things: not so clean bed shirts, the bathroom was a catestophy! all the water after the shower was on the floor because of the hole in the ground. br... as well, the way to the center, you go through a very poor district, really poor and depressing view.. but.. if these things are not so important to you, then you can enjoy your stay"
22,7,"Oct 27 2006 	Great youth hostel in ideal location	We stayed at the Far East Hostel in September 2006.Being my first trip to China and indeed Asia I trusted my travelling buddy wouldn't lead me astray with Youth Hostels. The hostel was located in the Hutongs about 20 minutes walk from Tian'an'men Square and the Forbidden City (where the bus to the Summer Palace also departs from), the nearest Subway is 5 minutes as was Bank of China and there are several tasty restaurants in the vicinity (visit the &quot;Beijing Old Folks Restaurant&quot; for Peking Duck).A double room en-suite cost about 298RMB but I think dorms were available for about 160RMB. Linen was changed every day and fresh towels, soap and toilet paper were provided, breakfast was western style buffet for 28RMB. Internet cafe/bar and restaurant all on the premises.The staff couldn't do enough to help us arrange further accomodation and tours and their travel advisory desk stayed open until midnight, bureau de change available however not for travellers cheques."
23,7,"Oct 19 2006 	Good inexpensive place to stay for a feel of more traditional neighborhood	Booked through hostels.com. Stayed on the hotel side of the hostel (about $30 US/night for two people). No problems with reservation and the property took credit cards (normal for hotels, but not necessarily hostels).Location in a hutong is excellent, but don't stay here if you want a Western location/neighborhood. The narrow street is lined with restaurants, laundries, mini marts and produce markets. Everything you need. Be sure to get oranges if they are in season--they were great. Most travel guides recommend a tour of a hutong while in Beijing. We stayed in one.Location is about half a mile south of the Hepingmen subway stop (walk on the left/east side of the street and turn left at the sign for the hostel--it is in about two short blocks) and you are close enough to walk to the Forbidden City. We had the Rough Guide map of Beijing, came in on the overnight train from Shanghai, and successfully navigated the subway (3 yuan per ride) and half mile walk to the hotel easily. But can see how you can get lost if you don't know which subway stop to get off at. Also, the map on the hostel brochure was helpful to cab drivers, but we usually had to show them the location on a larger city map to orient them as well. The hostel needs to improve the map/directions in its brochure for taxi drivers.Restaurant in first floor of hotel had an excellent breakfast buffet (28 yuan) and good Chinese food for dinner, both very reasonably priced. Price for large (600ml) bottles of Tsingtao beer ranged from 20-30 yuan in hotel basement bar, 5 yuan in hotel restaurant to 2 yuan (25 cents US) at convenience store next to hotel. And the room had a refrigerator to keep water and beer cold.Minor issues - Shower leaked and drained across bathroom floor. Air conditioning was turned off for the season during a warm spell in October--only presented a problem if you sat in your room during the day, which would be silly and we didn't do."
24,7,"Oct 1 2006 	A quirky sort of place	Not the easiest of places to find. It's right in the hutong, so you get see the real China, before they knock it down, but Taxi drivers have no idea where to go. Our one from the station had to ask for directions. Always take a map with you when you leave so you know how to get back. Is within walking distance of Tianamen square and metro though.Another thing, the hostel is either the courtyard across the road from the hostel, or the basement of the hotel(which is cheaper). Basement was a bit smelly though, but was OK, if you stay in the courtyard, you have to take a night walk across the courtyard for the loo. As for beer - buy from the shop in the street for 20 RMB, way cheaper than the hostel/hotel bars and cheaper than water!. Internet is free in the courtyard hostel, so don't pay in the hotel basement. The food was OK in both hotel and courtyard, but take a wander up the street for some good cheap chinese food. The great wall tour to Jinshinlang to Simitai was booked through them as well and worked out fine.Courtyard is definately cool to hang out in and meet people"
25,7,"Aug 31 2006 	Stay Away! The Pits!	This is place is awful - don't stay here, don't stay here, don't stay here!The hostel's information makes it seem like it'll be all peaches &amp; roses, but this is hardly the case. It even says if you have a problem with a cab driver to contact &quot;Sally&quot; or &quot;Jason.&quot; Well, I had a tremendous problem getting from the train station to the hostel with a cab driver who wanted to drop me off on the edge of a construction site in pouring rain until I flagged-down a police officer who made the guy take me to the hostel. By the way, this took 1hr because even with a map this place is in an unknown location for cab drivers (Yes, it looks like it's centrally located but it's in a niche that is shantyville).Upon arriving at the hotel I very politely asked for directions to be written in Chinese alongside the map provided online for guests. &quot;Sally&quot; (she's Chinese with an English name) was extremely unwillingly to ask a staff member to write directions. She kept saying, &quot;I think the map is quite good.&quot; Even though, I may sound irate in this review I was completely calm and polite during this episode. Finally she agreed and told a staff member to write some directions. Then she went to the corner of the desk and in Chinese began speaking about me to other hostel employees and pointing at me.The kicker later that same day when trying to get back to the hostel I had to flag down 5 cab drivers before one actually knew the area and even he got lost.The service is completely 100% rude. The next night I stayed at the Sleepy Inn Hostel and I don't even care that I wasn't able to get a refund. There is not 24hr hot water in the dorm-style rooms and the towels provided are frayed and holey (no joke). Also, the bathrooms and bedding has much to be desired. My sheets had faded blood stains on them (probably from a former guests Aunt Flo - nothing grotesque). I can't figure out why people recommend this place. It reminded me of a place prostitutes would go to perform tricks. It's dingy, stodgey, unkept, and the location is awful.It is in a really bad neighborhood and if you're a female traveling alone you will not feel entirely safe walking down the street where the hostel is located. It is an intriguing neighborhood with Chinese setting up makeshift convenience store in their living room and there are many public toliets on the road because of the poor living conditions.My adivce: print off the online map and try to find a cabbie to take you to the hotel to see the neighborhood (quite interesting) and stay at the Sleepy Inn where it's clean.The place is not worth your money. There are much better hostels where you get more for the same amount of money."
26,7,"Mar 26 2006	Highly recommended but hard to find!	The Far East Youth Hostel is a bargain in Beijing. It's right in the hutongs so you feel like you are in the real China but still manages to be quiet and to enjoy an undisturbed night's sleep. It's about 20 mins walk to Tiananmen square.The hostel is also a hotel and this is quite confusing. If you are on a budget, make sure that you ask for the hostel rooms, but we managed to negotiate for a hotel room and only paid 200yuan a night.The room was a very spacious room with an enormous bed, 2 chairs and a small table, a desk, small fridge, a wardrobe and a tv. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a hot shower and western-style toilet. The room was cleaned every day. You can also request hot water to make tea.The hotel has a bar downstairs with internet access (although sometimes you have to wait) and a cheap bar and tv. It also has a small store and travel centre and the staff understand English (essential!).On our last day, we left our luggage at the hotel until 7pm for free.Would definitely recommend and use again."
27,7,"Jun 8 2005	The perfect budget hotel	The Far East Hotel (next door to the Far East Youth Hostel) is the perfect place for budget travelers, and there is no reason to stay anywhere else in Beijing. It is cheap (&lt;$15 US per person), it's clean, the rooms have been remodeled, it's a fun place, great location, and the staff speaks english and is very helpful. They have a great travel agency there and a 24-hour cafe/bar downstairs where you can hang out, watch dvds, or use the interenet (for cheap). There is a restaurant downstairs that has a descent breakfast buffet. Next door at the hostel, there's a good restaurant that serves Western-style Chinese food and a patio where you can hang out and drink beers for less than $0.25 US! Between the hotel and the hostel, there are plenty of travellers to meet, and you can walk to Tianenmen Square or go shopping for cheap stuff nearby. It is set right in the midddle of the south hutong area of Beijing. The only problem is that it's tough to find, so print out the map on their website to show to the cab driver..."
28,7,"Nov 25 2004	Nice place but don't use their taxi to airport	I had never been to Beijing before and this place looked cheap and convenient. It was. You can stay in cheaper rooms or dorms there but I paid for a whole room for myself, knowing I'd be exhausted from a long flight. I had a standard hotel room. The room was clean enough, old but in good condition. I am not very picky about those things. I liked the friendly staff at the front desk, and they have a nice bar in the basement where you can watch free movies and get on the internet for a reasonable charge. (The connection is not always good, though).Also a little counter where you can get all kinds of snacks and water. I think the area around the hostel/hotel would be fun to explore, it was certainly interesting to view as my taxi pulled in from the airport. He had a bit of trouble finding it, even though I had a map in Chinese off the website. It is definitely on a side street. I arranged a great tour of the Great Wall with the tour desk there. That worked well.My only caution is about arranging a taxi to the airport through the front desk. Maybe it would have been better to do through the tour desk but it was closed and I needed to leave early in the morning. When I came down the next day, a nice French couple was also waiting. Turns out we were booked in the same cab, and we both paid quite a high price for the cab. That wasn't the worst part. It wasn't really a cab- no markings or meters. And the driver didn't know the way to the airport. We had to tell him the way by watching for the signs with airplanes on them. He missed one turnoff, and proceeded to back up on a busy Beijing freeway about a 1/4 miles. We were truly almost killed. It was crazy! He was not a good driver. So you may do better going out in the street and waving down a cab!"

1,16,"World Class Experience	The China World Hotel is a beautiful hotel with world class service. Located above the Trade Center complex there are many very high end shops and stores all within a 2 min walk from the hotel. The rooms are very comfortable and classy. If you are going to come to Beijing and want to make an impression on clients or customers, this would be the place to stay. If you are new to China the staff there can be very accomodating and helpful."
2,16,"Nov 7 2009 	Top class hotel and what you would expect from a ShangriLa hotel	Have stayed in this hotel a few times when I am in Beijing. It is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel which is part of the ShangriLa chain. Rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious. Internet provided as part of the room. Lobby area is large and breakfast is good. Mostly, the service is top class from reception to door man to cleaning staff.  The walls are thick and you will have a good sleep as you do not even hear people walking along the aisle at all.Location is very good - only 10 minutes walk to Silk Market and shop and restaurants within the same building as the hotel."
3,16,"Oct 1 2009 	Very good but hardly "" Shangra-la""	I have stayed at other &quot; high-end&quot; hotels in Beijing -but this was my first experience with China World. It is a really nice hotel -but you better like &quot; Big-ness&quot; as it is really, really large. I was somewhat confused after arriving in my room as the hotel information made it clear the the hotel has its own water purification system -yet the person who checked me in and escorted me to my room made it clear to only drink bottled water ( which you really ought to make the practice anywhere in Beijing anyway)After a long flight ( 14 hrs) - I was ready to grab a bite and crash - so I went to the &quot;Cafe&quot; restaurant. Informal and adequate -but there were a bunch of little kids running around and playing at the buffet, picking up food, rolling on the floor - basically being unwatched &quot;kids &quot; - the restaurant staff gave them the evil eye but made no attempt to tell the parents who were seated at a large table in the corner - to go make them behave. It was really a pain and other partons were obviously upset. A five star hotel would have addressed the issue.The room was great -lots of international TV channels - staff very polite but it was a little surprising to find that some could not speak English - case &amp; point. One evening I wanted to go to the &quot;Gourmet Corner&quot; -a place advertised on their web site as well as the in-room info. This is a great place to grab a good sandwich and go back to your room. Problem was that in order to make myself clear ( the desk could not direct me to it &amp; even claimed there was no such place) - I went back to my room, got the hotel book, went back down had &quot;pointed&quot; to the information - then the light shown and a very polite staffer escorted me ( out the building, across the street and to the shop) - OK - no big deal - but 5 Stars -Really?I took my staff to the Arie restaurant one evening -really quite nice -good service and the food was really very good -but it was not truly outstanding - which is what I had hoped for. Price is really not too bad however -so as they say - you get what you pay for.Westerners should be especially cautious just outside the hotel. Almost every time I walked off-property - I would hear &quot; Excuse me sir - I am student -can you talk to me?' - Well DON'T -they're hookers...just ignore and keep walking. This is not the hotel's fault -just a note of caution. There is great shopping - an entire mall is down the escalator -Starbucks etc -good location and most helpful staff. I wouldn't give it 5 stars -4 or 4+ maybe."
4,16,"Jun 24 2009	Beautiful and luxurious!	We arrived after midnight, very tired after a delayed flight, but we woke up as soon as we got in the room; it was so gorgeous that we had to take pictures, and it had an interesting cityscape view. The breakfast buffet was extensive. The pool was terrific, full size and and beautiful. The area is upscale and business oriented, not a neighborhood. One downside was that when we tried to arrange to extend our stay at the group rate, we were only quoted the rack rate. The internet rate was much less, but still quite expensive, so we ended up moving to another hotel for the extra days."
5,16,"Jun 6 2009 	What a great introduction to Beijing Hospitality	My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at China World Hotel just for one evening. I was in Beijing for 8 days but unfortunately, our group had already confirmed at another hotel. We stayed one night at China World along with some friends and our stay was fantastic. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.Our group stayed at the Beijing Hyatt and I was definitely more impressed with China World. The group coordinator is thinking of changing the hotel accomodations for next year to China World based on several recommendations.Rooms were clean. Service was great. The lobby is incredible. Overall, a great experience."
6,16,"May 11 2009 	Nice Stay	Really liked this hotel. We were told noone spoke English, but this was not the case. I thought the rooms were lovely. Very well decorated and lovely big bathroom. Nothing bad to say at all."
7,16,"May 11 2009 	Nice hotel but expensive	Hotel is clean, staff ok (some very friendly, some not), comfortable room, nice bathroom, wi fi in the room. Good location in the Chiina world building, and only 10 min walk from the silk market, and close to a subway to get around Beijing. Breakfast is very expensive there, so try to get it included for free, or eat elsewhere if you have to pay yourself. Gym is really good there. Would recommend this if you need to stay in the area (alternative is the traders,a little cheaper which is also a shangra la hotel, but in the next China world tower (walking distance))"
8,16,"Apr 30 2009 	Mediocre service worst food poisoning ever	We just returned from a 5 day stay at the China World Hotel, where my boyfriend was participating in the ISDA Conference. We would not have stayed at this hotel otherwise, and I regret that we did.CWH is an impersonal monster hotel staffed by a veritable army of young extremely keen Chinese staff, with a command of English that was lacking in key client facing roles like the reception and concierge. Some of them did try extremely hard to be helpful, but their understanding wasn't always up to snuff.Although I had specified no end of information on our online booking, the receptionist proceeded to verify everything except one vital point - NON SMOKING ROOM! We were taken to a repugnant room on a smoking floor, and then had to hang about while the poor bellboy tried to sort it out. The girl from the reception came to bring up the new room keys, but told us the number so quickly that none of us could find the right room after she had run off, and the bellboy had to call downstairs again to find the right room.Like most of the 5-star hotels in Beijing it is vastly overpriced, particularly when it comes to food and drinks which are much much cheaper outside the hotel, or even at the supermarket in the mall in the basement of CWH. A bottle of water was 4.50 from the mini bar, although 0.30 from the supermarket. (Note that housekeeping does show up twice a day and will supply two bottles of free water each time if there isn't any water on display in the room.) The prices on the wine list in the Aria restaurant would turn your hair white.CWH has the usual range of facilities, such as a large swimming pool which gave my boyfriend red spots all over his torso.Housekeeping were very thorough, but would appear at all times of day. They would show up just when you had returned from breakfast and wanted to refresh yourself, or at 10pm when you were just returning from dinner. They wouldn't change the towels unless you put them in a basket under the sink, but would fold them up again, even if wet. The toiletries are Occitane, and very nice, and they do supply the best range of extras I have seen - comb, 2x toothbrush/paste, razor/cream, laundry powder, nail clippers, Listerine, shower cap, emery board, etc.We stayed on a Horizon Club floor. The rooms were ok in size, and although the building dates from 1991 the rooms look like they belong in Trump Tower. We were offered the option to pay an extra 25/night for a room with a free breakfast (although this was already in our rate, hello!) and a better view upon check-in, but I would not recommend this - everywhere you look you are surrounded by skyscrapers anyway, so there is no view. We were facing the burnt out shell of a massive building behind the very massive CCTV building, which was destroyed by fireworks at the Chinese New Year, but it was some distance away so not terribly offensive.Staying on a Horizon Club floor you get free breakfast and free drinks and nibbles at happy hour. The breakfast is a mix of Chinese and Western things that doesn't quite work, especially as the Chinese don't seem to eat anything different for breakfast from what they would have any other time of day. Some of the food is quite strong and nothing is marked as such. I did see an ant walking around among the salad, so I do wonder about the cleanliness of their kitchen, especially after I got the worst food poisoning ever after eating a small amount of the nibbles at happy hour.We put off filling in the customer survey form for several days, and by the last day they sent note saying they would give us a voucher for food or drink in the hotel just for filling in the survey. This was worth 18.20, but I didn't get to enjoy it as I was too busy throwing up the happy hour nibbles...CWH is located on the subway line at Guomao (access through the mall in the basement), so an easy and cheap ride to Tiananmen Square. It is rather inconvenient though for sightseeing generally. The doorman can put you in a taxi with a driver to get you where you want to go (although sometimes that means a 15 minute walk from your actual destination), but good luck getting a taxi back. We never did manage to hail a taxi in the street, so it was good that we did know our way around the subway network.I can't see that I would ever stay at this hotel again. If we were ever going to a conference here I would stay somewhere else."
9,16,"Apr 17 2009 	Such a nice place to stay in Beijing!	I have stayed at China World Hotel, Beijing for several times in the past year and it was really impressive experience. The service is quite nice and the facilities are very comfortable. More over, when staying in their Horizon Club rooms, their staff always lead us into our rooms to check-in. We really appreciate your service and the details such as the fresh flowers and delicious chocolate. The pajamas with our names embroidered were really a surprise! The guest floor we lived in was very peaceful. The 24-hour Horizon Lounge and business service was really very caring and convenient. I look to staying there again!"
10,16,"Mar 22 2009 	Superb comfort	Only good things can be said of this hotel. It's not cheap, but I don't have a single complaint against it. The location is great, the staff brilliant, the gym is big, there is a great pool, the food is lovely, the rooms super comfortable with great beds... even internet is free. Watch out for pricey business centre services and for breakfast not being included in room rate... but still worth it."
11,16,"Nov 29 2008 	Came for the conference stayed for the shopping	Really nice hotel - great, extensive breakfast and 10-15 mins walking distance to the Silk Road shopping center if you're so inclined. Service was great. My glasses broke and the 'hotel engineer' tended to them for 30 minutes to fix them. The result was complete carnage but he was very friendly and dedicated.Rooms are large and have the rare and wonderful feature of a shower that doesn't spray you with cold water when you turn it on - because it faces away from the entrance. Sounds simple but is rare enough to be noticeable.I stayed at the Beijing Hilton during this stay and enjoyed this hotel more. It was very pleasant, and if you have a conference at the venue, don't hesitate to stay here."
12,16,"Oct 26 2008 	Great hotel in Beijing	We stayed at the China World hotel in Beijing for 9 days. The hotel is run by the Shangri-La chain, and it is up to their typical excellent standards. The public areas are opulent. The room was good sized and had very good amenities, but it was not as large or opulent as a room we had on the same trip at the Pudong Shangri-La in Shanghai. The hotel staff was very good and had the best English language skills we encountered in any hotel in China. The China World is part of the China World Center that includes a couple of office towers, the Trader's Hotel (also run by Shangri-La and bit less expensive) and the China World shopping mall which is filled with designer stores from Euorpe and the US and also has several restaurants. We tried several restaurants in the China World mall; South Beauty and Royal Food were by far the best. Only one glitch in our stay: We sent our laundry and dry cleaning and some of the laundry came back stained or over bleached; a surprising mistake for such a good hotel."
13,16,"Sep 22 2008 	Quintessential Luxurious Chinese Experience	I loved this hotel. The service was exceptional while being very humble. All my request were met and exceeded. The lobby is rich, without being over the top. I especially enjoyed the live music each night in the lobby. I did manage to try a few of the restaurants. The Chinese restaurant is very tradititional. I loved the Mediteranian restaurant. I would definitely stay at China World Hotel again and again. Of coarse, it's a Shangri-La Hotel..."
14,16,"Aug 30 2008 	Energy saving to the Max!!!	Stayed here before the Olympics near the end of July/start of August and had a pretty good experience. They were renovating things and adding some features to the hotel for the Olympics. In addition, we saw tons of Olympic staff, as well as being able to witness a security practice led by the Beijing police. More on that later, as well as the reason I picked Energy saving to the MAX!!! as my title.I have to say- the China World Hotel is starting to get a little bit old as the feeling. Somehow, the rooms are starting to feel dull and not bright to me- unlike last year. Our check in was very good- with the staff being extra nice and calling us by name after they knew who we were. Also got a China World Prestige membership, in which gives you lots of features and amenities. Also, room rates are cheaper, and they give you lots of coupons and freebies whenever you stay. Dining is also heavily discounted if you eat at their restaurants. We got a free box of mooncakes and a birthday cake as well during our stay using some of the coupons, and we have some photos of them!Rooms: We stayed in two different types of rooms. Had a free night stay in a regular room, and then later got a room for around 1,000 RMB and got upgraded to a Horizon Club room. The color scheme is mainly beige (darkish) and regular wood...which kind of makes the room look really pale. Both rooms had their own differences- mainly that the Horizon Club room had L'Occitane toiletries (the bigger size- not the Island Shangri-La mini size), different writing pads, different slippers (higher quality), and lastly a DVD player. Otherwise the other features were the same.Layouts were different for each room. Our HC room's bed faced the TV, while the regular room's bed faced the window. Kind of weird...Bathrooms were very nice and very large. The shower has some shiny pink tiles that look metallic- and there are actually signs that tell you how to use it! The tub is also very large. Everything is by Grohe. And the regular room has the Lavender toiletries.Horizon Club: They were renovating here too for the Olympics. Can't really see any big difference after the renovation other than some cleaning up and newer things. It kind of made it annoying as the HC became half of the size during our stay.Food was as good as last year, but the selections were not as big. Less variety mainly in the dim sum/steamer area, and everything else was unchanged. Very fresh and yummy food at the Happy Hour and breakfast. Only thing I didn't like was that the staff, during happy hour, were standing in front of where you get your food. And it's like when you want to get food, it seems like you are getting blocked by them.There's also a conference room and a computer room to use in the Horizon Club. Color scheme is marble, blue glass, beige, wood, blue and red. Complaint about the food: The fried rice here is also hard, like other Shangri-La properties. Dining: WONDERFUL! Shang Place was just renovated and was open during our stay and it was scrumptious. Had plenty of food there and got a discount due to the fact of the Prestige membership. Have some photos...so you can see what's there! The memorable things were their plating (they could make it look like a mango, flower, etc.), and the taste of the food. Fish with a mango sauce tasted crisp as it was fried, and the fish was very tender. Also, they cut it with a checkerboard pattern, and when the fish was fried, it opened up so it looked like a mango when you cut into it, cut it to squares and open it. Interesting! The decor changed a lot. Back back then, it had lots of gold and wood. Now...it's lots of colors, as well as a more modern decor. Lots of chandeliers and flowers too. Had breakfast at Scene A Cafe once, and it was great as well. Their items are very interesting- very creamy oatmeal (never see it in other Shangri-La's), a vegetable juicer in which you can get fresh juice from the juicer, honey from big jars, healthy drink (basically banana blended with milk- really good), and more! Everything is delicious and very fresh. There's fresh yogurt as well. Main sections are: Hot food, Chinese cooking station, western selection, Japanese section, fresh fruit and juice section, and a bakery section. Health Club:Again, very nice! They said they renovated the pool- but didn't really see much difference (probably just changed the tiles of the pool). The pool is a lap pool, but no one used it. Rules got laid back- now you don't need to wear a swimming cap! The lockers are very big, and the locker rooms are a big facility. Each locker has a plastic bag, slippers, towel, and a bottle of water. Their hot tubs are very nice. One side is really cold, and one side is hot. Didn't want to go into them though as the people using it were wearing nothing- that kind of breaks your feelings of wanting to sit in a hot tub...right??? Showers use a glass bottle that pumps out the Lavender flavored shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. But I don't think it's really safe to use glass (breakable), and the pump is hard to pump! No one really used the pool during our stay except for us and 1 or 2 other people.When we were there, they also put out peaches- very fresh and delicious. Beijing is famous for peaches and they were very good!Negatives:CWH is starting to save money. As part of the amenities, they started to give less of the food related things. Last year, I wrote: &quot;they gave us many different delicacies like mousses, egg tart, dim sum, cakes, etc.&quot; Not at all this year! We had the membership still, but the only extra they gave us was more fruit (almost like giving you $5 USD worth everyday- and that is a ton of fruit!!!), and several pieces of coffee flavored jelly. This hotel saves electricity. But not in a good way! They turned off almost all the hall lights (except for the small room number lights). The big chandeliers and main lights were closed! Plus, there was some smoke in the hallways at night. Anyway, whenever we returned late, the feeling going to our room was just really spooky. Not only that, the towers close their lights earlier than everyone else- even China World phase three lights were open (and it's not even done yet), but every other light part of the China World complex was closed.The health club staff was not very enthusiastic. They never talked or helped us, and when it got to closing time, they wanted everyone to leave as quickly as possible. That should not be!Security Check/ Special things: This was just WOW. They added security gates (like at an airport) to the lobby for one night (several hours). Plus, suddenly, tons of Audi A6's (about 30 of them!!!) and lots of vans were parked throughout the port cochere and driveways to the CWH lobby. Guests were told to leave by using the mall...which was a little bit annoying.They created some planter thing that basically covered the view that one could see from the main doors of the hotel. It wasn't done when we left though- and it looks like it's a permanent feature as there were some loud noises. One really interesting thing is that they have a lady in the lift lobby (on the lobby level) in which helps you press the buttons for elevator/lift and then helps you leave the door open so that you can go into the elevator. The lady was very friendly and nice, and we never saw her being lazy or looking bored- signs of an employee that should not work in the hotel as they can make the hotel look bad. Olympic staff and cars were always at the hotel during our stay. Mainly they brought things and asked some questions- probably were staying at the hotel too! During the day, in the lobby, there are people who play instruments. Piano, clarinet, violin, and more! And very nice music too- some of it is also Chinese music.Conclusion: China World is still a very nice hotel...but they still need to fix some things so that it can become a great hotel. The rooms are starting to look old after many years of use, and the hallways and electricity situation was a little bit scary. One does not want to walk at night to their room in a hallway that is not as bright as it is in the day- they will be thinking, &quot;What happened???&quot; Also, the health club staff needs to be more enthusiastic about their work. If these negatives get changed, this hotel will then be a better hotel to stay in!* Posting photos from the date I took them, so not all photos are on yet."
15,16,"May 27 2008	Well located luxury business hotel	The China World Hotel is a well run, well maintained and very well located business hotel in the Chaoyang district of Beijing. I had arranged an airport transfer through the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised to see a hotel representative waiting for me at the end of the jetway after the long flight from the US. She walked with me through the terminal to immigration, then to baggage claim and finally to the carpark to meet the hotel driver. This was about as smooth and effortless as an airport transfer can be. The hotel itself has a grand and spacious lobby, with a swift and efficient reception desk. The desk clerks were friendly and were fluent in English. My luggage arrived in my room just moments after I did. The room itself was well laid out, with a spacious work area, laptop sized safe, sitting area and fridge. The bathroom included a large shower and separate bathtub with good lighting. They also provide complementary fresh fruit and bottled water each day. The internet access was easy to configure, though expensive (140 RMB/day) given the overall price level in Beijing. The breakfast buffet offers many western and Chinese choices, but is expensive The location is terrific for tourists, as the hotel sits atop a subway stop (Guamao), from which one can easily get to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and other tourist sites. It's also a short walk to the Silk Street market, which is a must for shopping for souvenirs, t-shirts, knock offs, &quot;silk&quot; pajamas, etc. Be prepared to haggle."
16,16,"May 25 2008	Great Hotel	Stayed here for 3 nights with Viking River Cruises. Best hotel of the tour! The Monday night seafood buffet redefined all concepts of buffet! (Don't know cost as it was paid for by tour). Breakfast was great...don't miss the homemade yoghurt. This hotel is getting 4 &quot;stars&quot; on this site, but the St. Regis in Shanghai is getting 5...this hotel was MUCH better! Was told this was the 2nd best hotel in Beijing. Can't imagine much better."
17,16,"May 12 2008 	Great hotel	I absolutely loved this hotel. Stayed here for a week on business recently and found this to be an excellent business hotel. The gym is one of the finest I've ever encountered in a hotel, the rooms are well-equipped and nicely designed. I loved the soft modern bed after a rock slab in Hong Kong. The staff are all incredibly nice, though not always helpful. The concierge couldn't recommend a tailor outside the ultra-expensive mall nest door, for example. I never knew that I needed someone to push the &quot;up&quot; button on the elevator, but it was nice to always have a warm greeting. The cafe restaurant has a grand breakfast buffet, but it's very pricey at about $40. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
18,16,"Apr 30 2008 	Nice but over priced	The hotel is nice and comfortable, but is quite over priced for what it is as there are other choices nearby. We ate at the hotel's Italian restaurant. The menu looked attractive. But the taste was not what it claimed for. The wine selection was impressive. It seemed there were more locals trying to impress other locals here. The evening dinner buffet was quite nice with great selections, but choice than the wester restaurant. It's location is convenient. If you have meetings after meetings within a day, it's a nice and easy place for people to come to meet you here so you don't have to fight the Beijing traffic."
19,16,"Apr 17 2008 	Wonderful hotel but very expensive	This hotel is definitely luxurious but its to be expected for the steep prices. Great beds, soft sheets, towel placed on the floor by your bed with soft slippers. Huge bathroom has both a deep tub and powerful shower. The rooms are quiet and the street noise cant be heard. Helpful tip: If you order a wake up call, they will deliver coffee or tea to your door along with the call. The work out area is big and looks well equipped. The pool is a lap pool; not suitable for children. But its a great pool for adult swimming. There are segregated hot (and cold) tubs in the changing rooms. The breakfast is varied with just about every kind of food imaginable. We had access to the Horizon lounge, with breakfast. Like previous posts, there were not enough tables for breakfast or for evening cocktails. The breakfast selection in the lounge is much more limited than in the main breakfast area. The evening refreshments food was fresh and inviting. The security in the hotel was tight, since the Olympic Committee was having meetings in the hotel at the time. Can recommend this hotel but not for travelers on a strict budget."
20,16,"Mar 31 2008 	Great hotel if you like them big and luxurious	When I stayed at the China World Hotel 10 years ago it was not a Shangri-La, which it now is. This time I stayed in a suit room which was absolutely super. The VIP limousine service from the airport was very efficient and welcoming. The gym and pool really nice, and the massage I took in the spa in the middle of the night was lovely. However, the Horizon lounge was a disappointment at least comparing with the Shangri-La in Bangkok. Not enough tables for breakfast and happy hour. It's a really nice hotel, but in my opinion it's not really worth the money. Stay there if the location is right for you (VERY heavy traffic), if you like big hotels, and if someone else is picking up the bill (or if you have more money than you know what to do with)."
21,16,"Mar 20 2008	Highlight of our trip!	The best hotel we ever stayed in! Really! The staff was very courteous,helpful, and friendly with everything. The rooms look exactly like the photos depict. We slept comfortably. Amenities were very, very nice. The restaurant where breakfast was served was superb! Variety of choices. We were pampered! The next time we are in Beijing we will definitely stay here."
22,16,"Feb 7 2008 	I recommend this hotel 100%!	We live in the suburbs of Beijing and recently had our staff Christmas Party at the China World Hotel, so decided to stay at their hotel for the night. Everything was absolutely fabulous!Great central location - close to everything (with the subway station located right next door)! Fantastic breakfast buffet, brunch buffet and truly the best dim sum restaurant in town. Everything at this hotel is first class and they offer many promotion specials so you often can get a great rate. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a first-rate hotel in Beijing!"
23,16,"Dec 31 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	My first trip to Beijing was a business trip. Stayed at the China World Hotel at the recommendation of the business colleagues that I was visiting in Beijing. Wow...what a hotel. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be one of the nicest hotels I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. The single King Room was large, even by American standards and was warm with lots of wood trim and art work in the room. The service was thoughtful and unobtrusive...nightly turn-down, slippers by the bed, bottles of drinking water (complementary) were placed by the bed and in the bathroom. The bath was large featured shower and separate tub. The lobby and the common areas of the hotel were beautiful, even if they were bustling with people most of the time. Live grand piano music filled the lobby -- a nice treat.Most enjoyable of all was the morning breakfast buffet. There were multiple stations in the buffet enabling any type of cuisine one wanted to sample...from traditional American bacon and eggs, to European to Oriental. Very well done. With the help of the local business contacts - who booked our rooms for us --all of this cost about the same price as a low-end business hotel in the States. The hotel is connected to a high end shopping mall, for strolls among Versacci and Louis Vuitton, if that is your thing."
24,16,"Dec 13 2007 	This is a 5-star hotel?!	China World Shangri La hotel is a bit like a Chinese knock-off of a Western luxury car. From a distance, if you look from a certain angle and squint just right, it almost looks like the real thing. Any closer, and it becomes immediately clear that it is not.The rooms are very poorly put together. Things do not fall apart largely because of enormous amounts of silicone sealant everywhere. Expensive fittings are ineptly attached and poorly maintained. Most things electrical, even elevator buttons, are not grounded and will give you nasty shocks when touched. Carpets were laid by someone who either hated his job or was in a lot of hurry, and have only seen casual vacuuming since. The airconditioning makes the air as dry as in an airliner, and sounds like one too. I actually woke up from being dehydrated on my first night there. To make the experience complete, the cleaners use the smelliest chemicals available. Spend a night in the room, and in the morning you would call Beijing smog a breath of fresh air.Oh yes, speaking of staff. They routinely ignore do not disturb lights, and do not bother to knock before entering rooms. What's more, they are quite difficult to chase away once they're in and have started going about their duties. Generally, except for the lovely elevator lady (there to keep undesirables out, but what a smile!) the staff sees the clients as an annoyance. Getting a round of drinks at the lobby bar is a 30-minute affair. Extra marks for uselessness and grumpiness go to the concierge.I have not stayed at any other Beijing hotels, but compared to Dubai, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur 5-star hotels China World Shangri La is a very unfunny joke. There are lots of supposedly 5-star hotels in Beijing that cost a fraction of Shangri La, and they cannot really be much worse. Stay elsewhere."
25,16,"Dec 11 2007	Safety Concern	On 11 Dec I visited my business guest at China World Hotel at 12 noon. While we were walking towards the Aria restaurant at the lobby, suddenly we were being pushed and ordered by a jecket male to clear. My guest and I were shocked. Before we could react, we were being pushed by another leather jacket male. We were concerned about our safety and decided not to have lunch and hurried back to my buisness guest suite room. Later the General Manager came to apologize and explained to my guest that there were a group of politicians behind us walking the lobby passage and the two male who pushed us were not hotel staff but politicians' staff. I felt strongly that our safety was being compromised in this hotel. Hence, if you are not a political figure be prepared to be physically (even you are a female) pushed around ignoring your safety not once but twice in this hotel."
26,16,"Nov 22 2007 	Love it!!	This is the most wonderful hotel i ever stayed.....the room is spacious, has comfy slippers, nice Aigner shampoo n bath gel, 4 - 5 magazines in the room. The hotel itself is grand, but staff is not customer centric though. Heard Bills Gates stayed here when he visited china in 2005. The location is not so good during peak hours, it could be bad traffic. But upmarket shopping is just near by."
27,16,"Nov 3 2007	Loved the China World	Stayed here for 5 nights Oct 17-22, had a wonderful stay. The room was large (1544-corner room with good view). Bed / pillows very good. service great. Location perfect for both business and leisure, the China World shopping mall right at your feet, no need to even go outside. Aria restaurant and bar fantastic, escpecially the cocktails made by Bruce and Johnson. Would pick this hotel again when visiting Beijing."
28,16,"Sep 28 2007 	illumious as Jade	The entrance to the hotel is impressive, we were escorted to our room and checked in in our suite. The staff is remarkable and very attentative. The hotel sits atop some of the best shopping for western goods. The pearl market is not far from the hotel. The forbidden city is only walkable, if you are in type top shape. Their is a subway stop right outside of the hotel. The room was very comfortable and 5 stars to the shower and the deluxe pressure. The only negative is that the eating at the hotel is extremely expensive. To get a cup of coffee on the club level required 2 workers and a wait of 10-15 mintues. The breakfast had some great dim sum. The gym is also 5 star. I would stay again."
29,16,"Aug 24 2007	Top of the World!	This place is your typical Shangri-la property - All class and high service levels consistently across every area. Check-in was very personal and we were escorted to our room and shown around.The Golden Circle membership doesn'r seen to have any impact until you stay for a while by the looks of it - the room was OK but pretty standard (at A$400++).Speaking of the room, it too was OK but there are better Shang's around. Stayed in HK a week before at the Shangri-la and that was another notch up.Overall, a wickedly expensive place to stay and an enjoyable place."
30,16,"Aug 4 2007 	wonderful	this hotel was above average, very expensive, but the service was excellent. up graded. free food and wine all day. room amazing, large, comfortable. enjoyed two nights, complete luxury"
31,16,"Aug 2 2007 	Excellent hotel for business travellers	I stayed here on business for 3 weeks July-August 2007, with a room on the 18th floor (Horizon Club floor, for which you get Internet access and breakfast included in the price).I arrived at the hotel in the morning after a long flight from the UK and received a warm personal welcome. The lobby immediately strikes you with its great opulence. I have to say I didn't tire of it after three weeks.The room was very spacious, with effective air conditioning. The carpet was clearly not new but it didn't really look worn in any way. All the fittings in the room and the beautiful marble bathroom were really well maintained and showed no signs of use at all. I also particularly enjoyed the large window overlooking Beijing; this was particularly effective during the handful of thunderstorms we had during my stay, for watching the lightning!I really only ate breakfast at the hotel, and that was wonderful. There is surely something to suit all tastes. The only slight criticism I have is that, being myself a hardened tea-drinker, it was sometimes difficult to get a top-up of tea in the morning. Also one Sunday morning I got to breaksfast at around 9am and it was completely full, which meant I had to wait a few minutes for a table. They appeared to be running out of a couple of items as well. But this experience was not repeated any other morning.I used room service a couple of times, and while this seemed rather expensive, it was excellently presented and warm. I only used one of the hotel restaurants on one occasion (the Summer Palace Chinese restaurant) and I wasn't all that impressed with the food, especially given the price compared with what's available outside the hotel, which can be really good quality. So I can't really recommend this hotel restaurant.I made good use of the extensive gym. There is a lot of equipment which guests can use free of charge. If you want to burn off some pounds from too much Chinese food this is the place to go. Free towels and bottled water are available. I didn't use the swimming pool despite my best intentions.I particularly liked the free shoe shine service, which I used several times.If you are on one of the Horizon Club floors you have free use of the Horizon Lounge. I used this a few times; on my first couple of visits the staff in there were very attentive, however, this seemed to change overnight, and I made a couple of visits where they completely ignored me. This is not the level of service I would have expected.There are all the usual luxury western shops in the shopping mall below the hotel but I didn't use any of these; the prices seem no different from home so I couldn't see the point. Instead I recommend you polish your bargaining skills at the nearby silk market!"
32,16,"Jul 7 2007 	Great Hotel - impacable services and food	I stayed on business at the China World for an entire week. The services and friendliness of the personal is unbelievable. The choice of food for breakfast and lunch is great, catering to various tastes for each ethnic background which exceeds the usual standard in Asian Hotels of that category. The rooms are huge as well as the bathrooms which have all amenities you can wish for. I ordered room service a couple of times which was fast, friendly and the quality of the food was great (mostly Asian).The Hotel has great facilities for meetings, and the bell captains make sure that you get around in the city and get back safely.Also, I ordered a pick up from the airport which I can really recommend. It worked out great and they awaited me right at the gate upon arrival and walked me through immigration. Overall, its an ideal place to stay and"
33,16,"Jul 4 2007	Was quite happy.	We enjoyed this hotel and had no issues whatsoever. I see some complaints, and experienced none of them. Room was quite clean, new, and staff was quite attentive. Luggage was brought to our room along with us. The breakfast buffet is extensive, on the order of something you'd expect in Vegas.The attached shopping center made it quite convenient to pick up odds and ends in the little super market, and there is a subway stop in the same complex."
34,16,"Jun 18 2007	Great Place	we were a group of 10 -- four adults and 6 kids between the ages of 13 and 6. stayed there 2 nights and also left a lot of shopping with the concierge, which was kept safely and delivered most efficiently to us. the facilities are A grade, the rooms well appointed, separate shower cabins and tubs, italian marble bath rooms and excellent choice of toiletteries! breakfast is quite good --- i read a review (before i went to stay here) saying that the breakfast is not good at all ---- i will highly recommend this hotel to everyone. the lounge is very lively and a great place to spend sometime. the location of the hotel is fantastic too!!! only the english of the staff is sometimes not too good ---- in fact about 50% dont even understand 'excuse me' 'salt and pepper' and 'water'. so we learnt the mandarin words for these!"
35,16,"Jun 16 2007 	Decent room but poor service	This is quite a large hotel with attached shopping complex. The room I stayed in was decent in terms of its decor and amenities. For the size of the hotel, the room was comparable to most 4-star hotel rooms found in Las Vegas with a comfortable bed, and a comfortable bathroom. However, the service received in the lobby bar and from the doorman was less desirable. On several occasions I was left to wonder if the service staff were not comprehending English, or if they were just rude and didn't care one way or the other. This may be a good hotel for business travelers who don't plan to spend much time there, because it is close to the convention center, but definitely not for vacation travelers."
36,16,"Jun 10 2007	Stay Away	Stay away from this hotel. Everything went downhill after we got into our room. The room was old; extreme wore carpet and needed major renovations. The hotels webpage advertised that they spent 30 millions in upgrade in 2003. Obviously all 30 millions went to fixing up the lobby and 0 dollars in their rooms. Not a 5 stars property, more like your local motels."
37,16,"May 9 2007 	Look for an other place	If you like to stay at a hotel with very bad service, tasteless rooms and pay about 350 euro a night, please go the China World Hotel. At first look the entrance looks chique, but after 15 minutes it becomes quite dull and all gold platter. We checked in in this hotel, and had to bring our luggage to our rooms ourselves. This I don't mind normally so much, but we had just a lot of luggage and paid really - for China - a ridiculious amount for a night. The room was totally boring, and not even met our reservation.It's really just a business hotel, although newly decorated, it remains a very boring and tasteless place. People at the reception are unqualified for the job, I would say, with these prices.If you have or want to stay here, please go ahead. If you like to get value for your money, and have a nice stay, go somewhere else. I've also been to the Shangrila hotel, and that's a very nice hotel. The same chain, but much nicer rooms and better service. That's the only other hotel I've been in Beijing, so I can't recommend an other hotel."
38,16,"May 4 2007	Excellent business hotel!	I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in April. While expensive, the hotel is beautiful and great for business travellers. The standard room was very spacious with a great marble bathroom and hude semi-circular shower stall. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, making it an effort to get out of bed in the morning. The business centre is one of the most comfortable and inviting centres that I have seen. The food at breakfast and at the Chinese and other restaurants was impeccable. The Aria bar was an excellent place to meet for a drink, sometimes well into the night! All in all, from the high activity levels at the hotel, it is obvious that this is the hotel of choice for business travellers in Beijing."
39,16,"Apr 29 2007 	Great hotel for business travelers	My husband traveled to Beijing in Dec. 06 for business purposes; and I tagged along with him, so spent many days in the hotel while he was in meetings below the hotel in the large conference area. Our room was gorgeous, modern and updated and quite spacious. The shape of the room allows for the bathroom to seem separated from the sleeping/sitting area. Modern bathroom has separate tub/shower and is large and spacious as well. Extremely comfortable beds and breathtaking view from the 14th floor. Even though we overlooked the busy street below, we could not hear any of the street noise in our room up on the 14th floor.We used the hotel car service to take us to/from the airport. Wonderful service. We were greeted at the gate by a polite, young man who helped us through customs and baggage claim and waited with us for over an hour while we attempted to locate a lost piece of luggage. His assistance was invaluable as we do not speak Mandarin and he helped us report our lost bag and navigate through the airport and out to the car. Upon check in, we were personally taken directly to our room by a nice, young lady who spoke excellent English and checked us in in our room. We did not need to check in at the front desk; we think this was due to using the car service. Our bags were brought to us immediately.While the China World Hotel is beautiful and the service excellent (we used the laundry service 3 times during our stay, had copies made in the business center, and received excellent treatment as English speaking Westerners traveling in China), the only drawback was the food in the hotel restaurants. We ate at 2 of the restaurants: one on main floor, Scene? (can't remember name) and one restaurant located on the 2nd or 3rd floor. We did not find the food enjoyable for the prices (expensive!) asked. We found our best dining experiences to be outside of the hotel/mall area.The tea lounge located in the lobby, on the other hand, served delicious tea and appetizers. I spent several hours a day sitting in the chairs of the tea lounge drinking tea. A fantastic location with pleasant, polite service.The mall below the hotel served as a good place for walking and window shopping during the frigid December temperatures. Many stores are high-end stores and quite expensive, but there is also a grocery store where we could pick up some snacks to eat in our hotel room.The location of China World Hotel is close to many historical sites, and we hired a recent college graduate to be our tour guide for two days. Wonderful experience and fantastic way to really learn about the area and the places we were visiting. Overall, our experience at China World Hotel was quite enjoyable. I would just recommend eating some meals outside of the hotel."
40,16,"Apr 23 2007	Great Perks	I stayed 5 nights on business for US$180/night, this is great value. Some of the great perks: (a) get a massage at Jing Chen on Level B2, a spa that is luxurious even by US standards. 18 foot ceilings, sunk baths, beautiful massive carved doors and excellent therapists (only US$60 for a 1 hour massage); (b) Sunday afternoon tea features live performance from soprano and tenor opera singers and a small full orchestra (in fact, live music daily in the lobby); (c) hotel breakfast is crappy, but DO NOT miss the Starbucks just a few steps round the corner one level down in the adjoining mall (Starbucks is actually a bit cheaper in Beijing than US and just as good); (d) the hotel is connected to a vast underground mall - skip the Louis Vuitton stores and head for the cheap sushi parlors, Sephora (if you forgot some toiletries, department stores, bookshop(with limited English books), etc.' (e) Aria restaurant in the hotel is rated very highly by Frommer's as one of Beijing's best Western restaurants, and it is true, so if you are pining for a standard &quot;new American/French&quot; type cuisine, you cannot go wrong here. Prices are same as in a five star US restaurant, but believe me if you are homesick...(f)lastly, I like how the rooms are quite large, I like the &quot;heavenly bed&quot; (like Westin), and how the room comes replete with every conceivable amenity (open all the drawers and you will find electronic safe, electric teapot, full stationery set (with staplers!) and excellent - fast - broadband connection (cable provided) at US$20 for 24 hours."
41,16,"Apr 12 2007 	This hotel has become a high-turnover volume shop...	I am writing this from the business center on the 3rd floor of the hotel. I have stayed here about 8 times over the past 5 years - 4 times within this past year alone.Service in this hotel has been in decline for some time. The service within the restaurants was not very good. We ate at Aria - a french style restaurant accesible from the lobby and a Japanese restaurant on the 3rd floor - in both restaurants we had to flag down staff several times during the meal to ask for more wine, bread, water, our bill. The Horizon Club (principally located on the 20th floor) has become terrible. The only words spoken by the staff are terse demands for your room number -- not once was I asked whether I wanted anything (fundamental since the tea I wanted can only be provided by a server - no self service). This is truly a high-volume, high-turnover hotel thus perhaps understandable that the staff doesn't care about its guests. If you can handle the location, strongly recommend the Shangri-La Hotel - this is located a distance from financial, commercial areas but is a completely different experence."
42,16,"Apr 12 2007 	Best in Beijing	My wife and I frequently stay at hotels in Beijing to get away from our regular pace. This hotel is our favorite. We book a room on the Horizon club level and only go downstairs to eat meals in the restaurants. We love the food in the club, and could stay up there all day reading a book or spending time together. The food in the club is great, and the service is wonderful. I would say though, that the rooms feel a bit dark because of all the dark wood paneling. Highly recommend the Dinner buffet in the Scene. It's awesome. The chocolate fountain on the buffet is a must, especially if strawberries are in season. And there must be at least 30 other desserts on the buffet as well. We will be going back to this hotel often."
43,16,"Feb 26 2007	great location	went with a large group of grad students. the location is great, easy to get there and all the cab drivers know where it is. It's also connected to a mall and very near a great foot massage place. The lobby is very nice and the breakfast buffet restaurant had a wide selection of food. the rooms were above average (had some nice artwork) and relatively clean, but were not brand new. It was comfortable enough to stay there and the service was great (the staff speak English and there's a business center on the 2nd floor)."
44,16,"Feb 7 2007 	More business than pleasure	On a leisure visit (back in Sept 06) to Beijing, we stayed for 4 nights during our limited time in the city. The hotel is situated in a very commercial part of town, with little character, but is very impressive upon entry. 1. The lobby is pure opulance (at least for China standards) and filled with visiting multinationals and businessmen. There were only a handful of vacationing families during our stay.2. The service, both front desk and concierge, are extremely good and knowledgeable, as one would expect for a business hotel of this stature and location. Check in was a breeze. 3. The room was nicely decorated and large. It seemed well kept and comfortable. Nothing out of the place, as one would expect for a 4+ star hotel.4. There's an adjacent shopping mall. Nothing spectacular and typical of most western boutiques and designer name brands. For real &quot;local flavor,&quot; try the Silk Market building just a block away. Not much in terms of silk, but loads of knock offs and bargain like crazy.5. Tourist sites like the Summer Palace and Tiananmen square are a short taxi ride away. Get ready to be mobbed by peddlers selling books, postcards and other site specific souvenirs upon taxi exit. We took the subway back to the hotel after visiting the Tiananmen sq. Unlike most major subways systems, this one didn't have automated ticket/token dispenser. One has to deal with a real person who only spoke Chinese.We would certainly stay at China World on return trips. It's only negative would be the overly business atmosphere and clientele. This should not be a problem if one is a business traveller."
45,16,"Dec 25 2006 	Destination Beijing	Stayed on the Club Floor. Good location - smallist but pleasant room. Concierge services excellent. Rooms immaculately clean, and the Club Floor services functioned extremely well.I will return here on my next trip to this part of the world."
46,16,"Nov 27 2006 	Stay at the new Ritz Carlton Beijing Financial	Its an average hotel. The rooms are nice yet small, but recommend staying at the Ritz Carlton Beijing Financial street as it is the best in Beijing. Book now for the Olympics too in 2008. However, I think the average person would do well at either place."
47,16,Nov 21 2006 	Busy hotel in Beijing - very nice and modern rooms	Great hotel! The rooms were modern and comfortable. The gym was nice and the attendants in the gym were very helpful and nice. I would definitely return here and recommend it.
48,16,"Nov 1 2006 	Definitely 'Bliss Bed' heaven	After suffering hard beds for 3 weeks in awful hotels I treated myself to a 3 day stay in this hotel based on the comments on this site. I admit I was a little bit worried because one of the reviewers stated that it was showing its age and I was paying quite a bit of money to stay here. But it was magnificent. The bed was truly heaven - I didnt want to get out of it! I was not particularly impressed with the staff on reception (but what a lobby!!!). And the location was not particularly good - mainly due to all the construction going on around. But that is to be expected in a city preparing for the Olympic Games and I was truly able to forgive. The bathroom is just fantastic and the toiletries really nice and substantial size. Prices in the mini bar a bit high and meals (room service) ditto but I honestly cannot say enough about how much I loved staying here and I did not regret it one bit. If I ever go back to Beijing I would probably stay there again, but make sure it is booked on the Internet as it is cheaper than rack rate (I know because I tried to stay an extra night and nearly died when they said how much it woild cost)."
49,16,Oct 12 2006 	Just Great!	Simply fantastic in all respects - no further comment needed.
50,16,"Oct 5 2006	Fantastic Hotel	We spent three nights here in October 2006 and it was a fantastic experience. This hotel is as clean and modern as anything you would find in New York or London. The lobby was one of the nicest (and largest) that I have ever seen. The rooms were quite large and the bathrooms were great - large and modern. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and very proficient in English. At one point, I requested a transformer so that I could charge my camera and it was in my room within 10 minutes. There was a health club and swimming pool but we did not use either. However, we walked through and they both appeared to be really nice - especially the whirlpool. The buffet restaurant was excellent - Chinese, Japanese, and American dishes were all available. The hotel is located a few miles east of Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City and is just a ten minute walk from Silk Alley. There is also a subway station located right in front of the hotel for those who feel adventurous."
51,16,"Oct 4 2006 	Elegant and Grand	My wife and I spent 3 nights at the China World Hotel after 2 nights in the Crowne Plaza. Even though we preferred the Crowne Plaza slightly, the China World is a great hotel which I thoroughly recommend.The only real problem with the China World is that its a little too big and impersonal. While we found the Crowne Plaza to be friendly and warm, the China World felt a little like a railway station. A very nice railway station, but still....First of all it has to be said that the lobby is very beautiful. On the Sunday there was a 30 piece orchestra playing classical pops which kinda blew us away. The marble, carpets, chandeliers are all very impressive. The rooms are very comfortable (we had a standard King), especially the bed which was probably one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in. The room is very large (bigger than the Crowne Plaza rooms) and very well kept. The bathroom is huge and had an enormous shower and seperate bath. Broadband Internet, I was delighted to discover, was free. The Health Club was absolutely awesome with a 20m indoor pool, sauna, oxygen room, gym, etc. etc. Location is a mixed bag. Its very close to the Silk Market for all your designer knockoffs and souvenirs, but other than that its in a fairly commercial part of town. Its obviously a good choice for businessmen since its attached to a convention center and there are dozens of high rise office blocks in the area. Taxis are cheap in Beijing, so location shouldn't really be a factor anyway.We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants since the prices were absolutely horrific and there are plenty of quality restaurants nearby. Hotel staff were polite, but not particularly friendly or helpful, (appart from the guy that presses the button on the elevator). Overall this hotel has an aura of having all the elements neccessary to be a great 5 star hotel, but without any real atmosphere. For a businessman its ideal, but for a romantic getaway its a little lacking. (Perhaps if the Crowne Plaza wasn't so warm and friendly I wouldn't have felt this way.)"
52,16,"Sep 7 2006 	Completely overrated mostly just dated	Stayed here for the 3rd time in 5 years (last time was 4 years ago); definitely this hotel is showing its age and the service has deteriorated in 4 years (very sad because this was a great hotel).Stayed on the 21st floor Horizon Club level room (my favorite floor because this floor can only be accessed by stairs within the Horizon Club). Room (the most expensive non-suite, executive room) was definitely dated, dreary (replete with the wall of dark wood containing the closet/safe/etc.), uncomfortable furniture and this monstrous desk that absorbed the entire room - just not pleasing or inviting to stay in. Room key de-magnetized each day, had to wait in the long lines at reception to get a new key made (showing passport each time). Yes, the elevators require room key to access your floor so I could not go to the Horizon Club to avoid the long general reception lines but was lumped with &quot;the masses.&quot;Hotel is absolutely overbooked each and every day, loaded with foreign businessmen on expense accounts who remind the hotel that no matter how bad the service, they will keep coming back to this place because they are not adventurous enough to seek out new hotels. Horizon Club level food area (there are 2 of them) were stuffed with people each day who camp out as if they have nowhere to go -- you are waiting to eat breakfast and could wait a long time. Further, the turnover in this hotel is ridiculous, the lines at reception were crazy. Also, I had to take my own luggage (very heavy) from the taxi as there was not 1 attendant outside greeting taxis.Gym (although amply stocked with different machines) is dated and somewhat dreary (after the supposed remodeling which was done this past year).Given the increased automobile traffic in Beijing, the egress to and from the hotel by taxi is really a mess. Arriving to the hotel from the Changanjie (from say the Jianguo Hotel direction) is a complete circular traffic jam.Contacted the Director of Rooms who basically gave me the run around telling me how sorry he was, how he wanted to make me feel better about the hotel, and would get back to me ... never heard from him again. You know what? I checked out 3 nights early and went to the Hyatt - much better hotel!!!"
53,16,"Sep 5 2006 	A modern Chinese classic	Anyone who does business in China today would be familiar with this hotel. Maybe I am exaggerating, but, to my mind, it is a modern take on classic hotels such as the Grand in Saigon or the Beau Rivage in Beirut. The typical China World guest likely spends most days in Beijing negotiating tough deals in either one of the neighbouring China World towers, or, if they are of a diplomatic bent, participating in the 6 party talks on North Korea. Either way, if you are staying at the China World today, you are quite likely witnessing history in some shape or another.Which to me, makes it even more remarkable that the staff at the China World never stop trying so hard. They are flawlessly polite and helpful. They could actually allow their service levels to slip one notch and still get away with it, such is the demand for accommodation at the China World due to extraneous circumstances. However, they do not rest on their laurels, and they are much the better for it.The rooms are outlandishly luxurious in a Beijing (and Shangri-la) sort of way -- you literally feel like an Empress, or an Emperor. The gym is very well equipped and does not have the perfunctory feel of other hotel gyms. The massage centre and its trained masseurs are excellent, even though overpriced in comparison with the rest of &quot;ordinary&quot; Beijing. I love this place. It is grand and over the top and does not apologise for it. I will return time and time again, almost certainly for reasons not entirely of my choosing, but I surely could not harbour any real ill will or dissatisfaction should I find myself holed up, once again, at the China World in Beijing."
54,16,"Apr 11 2006 	definitely 5 star	This hotel was all it was promised to be, including the price tag. I was able to negotiate a lower price, but it was still pricey. The beds are wonderfully soft and I slept like a baby. The only complaint is the price of the rooms, but in the end, I 'd pay it again."
55,16,"Mar 30 2006 	Beijing's Best	This is the only hotel I've stayed at in Beijing but I truly enjoy going there and don't see any reason to try others. This place continually does a great job. Example... first time I stayed there I had an early meeting so I asked if I could access the fitness center (which, by the way, is excellent and modern) an hour before it normally opens. YES - was the immediate answer. No checking with the manager or anything. When I arrived the following morning there were 2 staff and a lifeguard on hand! Rooms are spacious and well equipped, and the &quot;events&quot; in the lobby are a continual surprise between opera singers and concert pianists and violin trios it's worth it to just spend an evening in the lobby bar!"
56,16,"Jan 7 2006	Chinaworld Beijing	Just got back from there. Wow! What a find. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. THe rooms were wonderful, the health club great, excellent service, the breakfast buffet was incredible. We also stayed at the Pudong Shangri-la. Prices on food, business services, laundry, and massages all cheaper at Chinaworld and it is a slightly nicer hotel."
57,16,Dec 28 2005	Wonderful service with a smile	Recently traveled to China for the first time. First stop was Beijing and the China World Hotel (part of the Shangra-la group). This is a wonderful business hotel. All the support services you could ask for and more. The staff was happy to help with any request. Ate in three of the hotels restaurants and they were very good. Also upgraded to the executive level which was worth the extra cost as it included a full breakfast; afternoon snacks enough for a light dinner; free laundry; and a nice lounge for meetings. Happy to recommend this property to those visiting Beijing.
58,16,"Dec 20 2005	Wow...what an experience.	I've stayed in hotels in many cities throughout the world, but never before have I been entertained by a full orchestra and five excellent opera singers in the lobby bar! After a long walk one Sunday, we returned to the China World and enjoyed this spectical. The rooms were very modern, decorated with flair and totally comfortable. I guess I expected to rough it in China---how wrong I was! Stay at the China World for a fabulous experience. Another plus is that the hotel is two blocks from Silk Alley! Fabulous shopping!"
59,16,"Nov 22 2005	One of the best hotels I have stayed in	My husband and I stayed here for a weeks holiday. Very luxurious and comfortable. Food excellent, staff very friendly and helpful. We were however surprised at how expensive the bars and restaurants were considering the cost of living in China. Taxis needed for sight seeing and shopping unless your budget runs to the designer mall underneath the hotel!!"
60,16,"Nov 14 2005 	Surprisingly good.	3 nights here on business, on my first trip to China. Lobby beautiful. Room a bit small but well appointed, bed and pillows/linen very comfortable, bathroom excellent. Staff very friendly and efficient, despite English not being spoken a great deal on the front desk. Still - international sign languages seemed to work OK. Food was a tad on the wobbly side - especially room service, but never a disaster, maye just the issue of western food in China. Health Club and Gym were outstanding. Three indoor tennis courts in the hotel as well."
61,16,Nov 11 2005 	All u need is china world hotel	been there for 1 week. just impressive location. tube just off the hotel. 1 stop to the silk market and few stops from forbidden city. service is great. breakfast in room ok.overall clean and silent.i have booked it over the web via traveleurope. great too.
62,16,"Sep 20 2005 	Nice Hotel	The China World has a beautiful lobby upon entry. And the rooms are nice but not special. Ours was a nonsmoking but it smelled of smoke. We found one person, Vivian, behind the front desk that spoke good english but it was difficult to communicate with others at the entry. The all day restaurant had a buffet but you could also order off the menu. It was expensive for China, which is usually a bit cheaper than most countries. Also, the location was near the American Embassy and about a 15 minute walk to the new Silk Street shopping building. It is quite a long way to get to the Forbidden City, a definite cab ride. So depending on whether shopping is what you want or history, you might chose China World or the Hyatt, which is much closer to the history."
63,16,"Sep 16 2005 	Not so much for the money	OK, it's a nice hotel. It has a nice exercise facility. It has internet that actually lets you do business (with a VPN), which I understand is rare in China. But the rooms are... merely adequate, and everything is outrageously expensive.Buffet breakfast for three? 50 dollars.Want a coke? 3 dollars.Airport pickup? 50 dollars. (Cab costs 15, found out later.)Ouch.Recommended for those on expense account."
64,16,"Aug 9 2005	I Am Impressed	I am a Malaysian born 3rd generation chinese and educated in the UK.Never gave a second thought of going China because of the old ideology.I have made peace with the homeland of my ancestors and I am proud to be chinese with a 5,000year culture.Thanks to the late President Richard Nixon for opening the doors to China.The hotel my wife and I stayed in is excellent. The food and service is 5 Star. The only problem is the Greeter can only say &quot;good morning&quot; only further conversation draws a blank face. Staff at the reception hardly speaks English. Wake up, the Olympics is less than 1000 days away.Transport is chaotic and as the saying goes it is an economic indicator of prosperity. If you take the subway it is clean,safe and pleasant.China is ready to take on the world.My only son is now in Shanghai and will be in Beijing this weekend.We will be there again"

3,17,"Apr 25 2008 	Shabby hotel shonky management - avoid like the plague	My Chinese friend and I booked a two bedroom apartment with a double bed and two single beds.Upon arrival we were given an apartment with four single beds only. We complained to reception, who told us they didn't actually have any apartments with double beds. When we pressed them further, they admitted that they do have such apartments but had given them to other people (despite our booking). The carpet, beds and bathrooms were also in decidedly shabby condition, so we wanted out.Reception told us we could cancel without charge, but we thought it best to confirm this with the hotel site we had booked through.Various phone calls followed as we spoke to the customer service line for the site, who in turn spoke to the hotel, who in turn spoke to us. Meanwhile we also rang some places to find a different hotel in the same area. Eventually we found one, made a booking, and were relieved we wouldn't have to stay in a shabby place with the wrong bed configuration.But then came the snare. Our complaints and phone calls had, apparently, taken just over one hour, and the City Hotel informed us that, although we had not yet used anything in the apartment (not even the toilets), it was their &quot;policy&quot; that we would have to pay the first night's accommodation, because we had been in the room for more than one hour. They were willing, however, to &quot;negotiate&quot; this down to 100 yuan.Right...so we spend one hour trying to sort out THEIR failure to honour our booking, and they want to charge US for it? I've never heard of anything so shonky in my life. It was only through some very heated discussion and raised voices down at reception that were were eventually able to get back our deposit and leave without charge.Does anyone really want to stay at a shabby hotel with a management that fails to honour people's bookings and then tries to charge them for the hotel's own mistakes? Shonky, shonky, shonky."
4,17,"Jan 7 2008 	Awful. Stay away far far away.	was supposed to stay here for two weeks but cut the stay short after I just couldn't take it anymore.no proswhat made it that terrible?:no real lock on door. (see photo) someone kept trying to enter while I slept--only chain kept them out, but you can still see in.no one speaks English.there was cigarette smoke everywhere. (EVERYWHERE)staff encouraged strangers to sit with you at breakfast. (who would smoke and blow it in your face while eating)in order to reach the street access it was necessary to walk through major construction and what smelled like open sewage.I have never felt this awful traveling. Truly it was disgusting."
5,17,"Oct 10 2006 	City Hotel - Fine Hotel - Close to the action of the bars subway 	Stayed there while my apartment in Beijing was being fixed. Not 5-star, but better than many Beijing hotels. Next door to several good pubs, close walk (0.5km) to the subway and easy to get taxis for work meetings. Clean room and friendly staff made for a good stay. Also next to several great local restaurants that cater to foreigners. Subway is a great way to get to Tiananmen &amp; the forbidden city, Military Museum, and it's the fastest way to the west side of the city due to the huge traffic on the ring roads. If you want a no frills good room for a reasonable price, pick the City Hotel (Chung Shi Bing Guan in Chinese - all the local taxi drivers know it!)"
1,20,"Good location	The best thing about this hotel is the location, its very convenient as a base to see Beijing major tourist sites. Room was nice but the bathroom wasnt functional at all (flushing issues).Hint: There is a seven eleven close by which has lots of good and yummy items at a great price."
2,20,"Very comfortable 	I stayed here for a few nights with my husband, as part of an organised tour with a group. As we paid for the tour as a whole, I can't really judge the value of this particular hotel.It's well situated, with shopping mall, enormous supermarket, pizza restaurant and lots more restaurants nearby. The rooms are clean and comfortable, though our bathroom was looking tired. Beds are very hard, as in many Chinese hotel rooms. Two bottles of drinking water and lots of toiletries and tea-making necessaries are provided.A little more information would have been useful - for example, there is an electric socket for use by UK visitors, but it's hidden round the side of the desk, so the first night we were charging gadgets from the shaver socket! Also, you need your room key to use the lifts; not knowing this meant it took me ages to get to our room, and my husband got trapped on the 12th floor and had to wait to be rescued.I would stay here again."
3,20,"Great Location Good Value	Before our stay, I asked for a .pdf file of hotel's name and address in Chinese so that we can show it to the driver at the airport. Immediately responded to my satisfaction.Location can't be beat. Connected to a mall, near a subway exit, surrounded by local chinese restaurants many of which are open 24 hours, bars and coffee shops, malls, international food chains, near to Wangfujing, Forbidden CIty, Sanlitun, easy to hail cab at any hour. Outside the hotel are lots of cars for a day's hire in case you want to go to the Great Wall, Ming Tombs, etc.. They speak English well and you can bargain for a good price. A police outpost is nearby too.Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The front desk is very efficient. The concierge readily helped us with the hotel cards and directions to tourist spots.The deluxe room we stayed in was recently refurbished. The bed was comfy as well as the pillows. We got extra pillows as requested, but no extra towels :( The bathroom is where I have my gripes. There were 2 of us registered as guests, but only one set of toiletries. We probably could have asked for another set, but we didn't bother. The soap was not replenished AT ALL, even though we stayed 3 nights here. Weird. The bathroom was in ceramic tiles, which was ugly and completely unexpected, like a throwback to the past. The showerhead and the tub were also antiquated and needed to be upgraded. I am very particular about bathroom cleanliness and sad to say, this hotel needed to improve in this area.I am a regular Marriott client, and I can safely say that this hotel has one of the worst bathrooms EVER. This should be due for renovation soon. Free wifi should also be installed in keeping with current hotel trends.Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the location and its value."
4,20,"Nov 26 2009 	Reasonable	This hotel is not the best but it really is in the central location and cheap. Don't expect a 5 star service. Beijing subway (line 5 &amp; 2 Chaowenmen Stn), Starbucks, McDonalds, Pizza Hut &amp; some local restaurants around the corner.Hotel concierge is able to provided any local information."
5,20,"Nov 19 2009 	nice hotel to stay	We spent 4 nights in this hotel.The room is clean and well maintained.Breakfast buffet is also great.Location is accessible to malls,restaurants and the subway.Would like to stay here again when we visit Beijing."
6,20,"Nov 19 2009 	Hotel with Great Service and Very Convenient Location	Good points: 1) great location - walking distance from the subway; access to the mall 2) rooms are clean 3) helpful staff - concierge staff are patient in writing instruction cardsDownside: The moment you step into the hotel lobby, it smells of cigarette smoke . Gym and pool are not within the hotel building. It's a good hotel to &quot;come home to&quot; after a full day of touring Beijing. Rooms are clean and are always in order, comfortable. Great location. You'll never go hungry as there are restaurants around the hotel that are open 24 hours. For the traveller that craves for the comfort of fast food chains, there's a McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks nearby. For those who want local flavor, there's a food court in the adjacent mall where you can have a taste of local fare. There's even the mall supermarket where you can buy the essentials plus food stuff that the locals buy and eat. Didn't have problems with room service either, despite the language barrier. Even before we arrived in Beijing, I was able to experience the customer service of both the Marriott chain and the Courtyard Beijing. I already made some inquiries about how to get from the airport to the hotel and even requested the instructions in Chinese to show the cab driver. I received answers to my inquiries or requests via email within 24 hours. Great service! The concierge can speak English and is patient in writing out instruction cards that prove to be very helpful when taking the cab around the city on your own."
7,20,"Nov 16 2009 	Conveniently located	We stayed here for a couple of nights as part of a tour group. The place is in a very convienent location and there are several places to eat in the area in addition to the restaurants in the hotel. There is a Pizza Hut &amp; KFC in addition to a Ramen place which serves Japanese style noodles. There is also a coffee shop and a 7/11, the latter being about 2 blocks from the hotel. We had a great stay at this hotel."
8,20,"Nov 12 2009 	Had a great stay!	Wow! My stay at the Courtyard by Marriott in Beijing was great!Many restaurants + Starbucks in the same building AND subway station a 1 min walk!The room I got was exactly like the one pictured above. Even if I was alone, they gave me a very confortable King Size bed! I booked this hotel not knowing that in China, you can get very decent hotel rooms at a ruidiculously low price, by this hotel was very cheap for the quality it is, compared to a stay in the US.I would definitely go back!"
9,20,"Nov 6 2009 	Good location but nothing outstanding	I only spent one night here to be closer to a business meeting the next day, so I was not able to use many of the facilities. The location of the hotel is convenient, with many restaurants catering for all tastes and budgets. Most of these restaurants are located in the nearby or adjacent shopping centres. There is a small supermarket where you can buy drinks and snacks for your room.The room was clean and of a very good size, providing a separate sofa and coffee table along with the king sized bed. The bathroom was also of an adequate size. There is much more value paying for internet access by the day (80RMB) rather than the hour (40RMB). Once paid for, you can also use it wirelessly in the main areas. Check-in and check-out was a breeze with the staff always friendly.It was a typical stay at Courtyard by Marriott in Beijing, excellent location and good value without being anything special."
10,20,"Nov 1 2009 	Don't stay here but if you do...	The hotels have two type of rooms, some that have been renovated and some that don't. When we first checked in they put us in an ugly, smelly, old room. We asked for a non-smoking room, but the room smelled like smoke. So when we requested a new room, they changed us to a recently renovated room. Those rooms are courtyard standard rooms, the old ones are not.Service at this hotel is horrible. The front desk is useless and they won't go out of their way to help you. The concierge tries, but they dont have the resources. So have your trips planed before getting there.To summarize, dont stay here, but if you do ask for a recently renovated room.There is a Starbucks and a McDonalds right behind the hotel. There are also coffee shops in the mall across the street. The subway station is really close too."
11,20,"Oct 23 2009 	Rather average but good value	This Courtyard hotel is in a fairly handy location about 10 minutes walk from Tiananmen Square and very convenient for the adjoining metro station. Despite this convenience and generally busy surrounding area, the hotel does nevertheless feel rather off-pitch. The building is looking rather dated, comprising several fast food restaurants and a mid-range shopping mall, with the Courtyard tucked around the back. The lobby is drab but the staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel seemed to be experiencing low occupation.My room was of a generous size with a large bedroom and separate living room. I think it was fairly recently redecorated and the bed was certainly comfortable with quality linens. The bathroom was dull. All amenities (safe, coffee/tea, toiletries, iron, tissues) were available - although, strangely, the iron had a UK power plug and all the sockets were Chinese!I had breakfast in the top-floor executive lounge and this was nicely presented and substantial. The lounge also offered a free happy hour with drinks and snacks in the early evening. Staff were friendly and helpful. No complaints there. I also used the restaurant one evening, which had an inexpensive menu but had a dull appearance with equally average food and staff.My expectations of this hotel from the website were of a good quality mid-range establishment in a lively, buzzing and cosmopolitan setting. In reality, despite being fairly good value and offers most things that a visitor could want, it just didn't quite match up to those expectations."
12,20,Oct 9 2009 	Photos Are Deceiving Not Up to Courtyard Standards	We tolerated a stay at this hotel because we spent little time in the room. It was our second room...we moved from a room with peeling wallpaper. Other hotel guests had done the same. This hotel is poorly constructed and maintained. The Courtyard name should not be affiliated with this property.
13,20,Sep 27 2009 	Good value well looked after in centre of city	Had an exellent time in this city although traffic VERY BUSY it was easy to get around. The room had been recently decorated but lobby/reception area could do with a revamp.
14,20,"Sep 26 2009 	A Quiet Safe Haven in the Middle of Beijing	IntroWe chose to spend the first 10 of our 15 nights in Beijing at the Courtyard because of its central location and the low prices during September. Our two rooms provided a wonderful base for our familys Bejing vacation.Location and TransportationAs most of the earlier reviews have mentioned, the short distance to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven was a big factor for us. We did not want to spend most of our time in heavy traffic, but prefer to see places above the ground as we travel. The nearby subway and train stations offer many options for those who do not favor cabs.The shopping center attached to the hotel was convenient with a grocery store, food court and department store along with the many other shops. They had most of the things we forgot to pack.Cabs are inexpensive in Beijing with fares to most attractions under 30Y (5USD). The only long day trip was to the Mutainyi section of the Great Wall; for 800Y we rented a van and driver to carry the five us (our guide and two college aged children.) Due to the road closures for the 60th National Day celebration, we decided to move to a hotel closer to the PEK airport for our final 5 nights because we were to depart PEK on the day of the celebration and many roads were closed downtown.Room Features and Price We normally use Marriott points on vacations, but the 500Y/night rate including two wonderful breakfasts was too low to use points. Because the hotel is one block south of the main east/west street, Chianmen Dondajie, the road noise was muted in our 12th floor king room. The bed was a bit too firm, but was fine after housekeeping placed a mattress topper on it the second day. Everything in the room worked except for the bath/shower faucet, which was temperamental. We played with it to get warm water, and found that we had to turn it about 5 times before the hot turned on. As there seem to be no self service laundromats in China, the retractable string in the tub for hanging laundry was wonderful. We hung laundry everyday because our clothes shrink too much in the dryer to send them out, and the laundry prices are high in this neighborhood. The A/C was great after a long day hiking around Beijing. The minifridge kept us supplied with cold drinks purchased in the downstairs mall. Within about 5 minutes of calling housekeeping, the maids brought us free ice for drinks.The staff keep the rooms clean and well stocked with 4 free bottles of drinking water each day because the tap water is not drinkable in China. The 22 channels on TV included the Discovery channel, CNN and several other English channels, so there is a good selection unlike hotels in several other countries we have visited.Restaurants in the HotelWe had a choice for free breakfasts: the 16th floor executive lounge with a limited menu (eggs to order took about 20 minutes as they came from the restaurant) or the 2nd floor restaurant, which was much larger and had a wide selection of Chinese and Western dishes. If you are from a smaller and quieter town, you may find the noise level to be high or unbearable in most places in Beijing. It is a good idea to take earplugs for the noisiest places. Sometimes you may feel that you are surrounded by a billion people, so we liked the quiet seclusion of the executive lounge for chilling out (open 5.30-7.30) and usually ate breakfast in the restaurant. One night we had burgers there, and another dinner we shared beef brisket. Both dinners were fine and cost about 40USD for two. We enjoyed the option of the Executive Lounge in the evenings for heavy appetizers, light desserts and free drinks because we often do not eat dinner. This lounge is a wonderful stop if the weather is too hot or cold to eat outside. The weather was perfect during most of our stay, so we were either exhausted from walking all day and headed to our room or spent the evening dining outside in the lovely weather.If you are a foodie looking for a special lunch or dinner, try the new Capital M restaurant just across the street from the South Gate at Tiananmen Square. The terrace view is worth a million dollars, and their fusion menu is out of this world. The lamb and oxtail were superb followed by a deluxe dessert tray for two that will definitely set back your diet. If you ask the concierge to make reservations, you can enjoy dinner with the most incredible view of the nightlights of Beijing. A full meal will run 50-75USD per person and is well worth it. This place made us wish we lived in Beijing!Concierge and Front Desk StaffThe concierge desk was helpful writing place names and addresses in Chinese on the hotel card so our cabbies could take us to the correct place (most of the time) and we could find our way back using the hotels cards. From our limited experience, very few locals spoke enough English to direct us to our destinations, and we certainly could not speak enough Mandarin to ask a question. So it is important to consult the concierge before leaving each day.The front desk staff spoke limited or very little English, so they usually could not answer our questions. Fortunately the manager and/or his assistants are around most of the day, and they do are quite friendly and speak English well. They answered many of our questions and are a big plus for this hotel. They made sure that we quickly found a cab each day. We saw few Western tourists during our stay, and it seemed that the hotel staff were eager to please their customers. Free Newspapers in the HotelAt both breakfast locations, they had several newspapers including the China Daily, which is extremely helpful with lots of Beijing news that interests visitors. USA Today arrives around 6PM at the Concierge Desk. With such a complete language barrier, it was a real joy to read the news each day especially the articles about Beijing.Guide Service and Where to GoWe used the service of a local guide who met us at our hotel the first 3 days, and had enlightening visits to the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, and the Great Wall. We preferred a half day the first 2 days due to jet lag. We saw rates ranging from 35-100.USD per day depending on the guides qualifications and number of people in your party. We found our guide, Jack, through an earlier TA review, and he did a fine job. His email is [--].After three days we felt comfortable taking a cab from the hotel and relying on our guidebooks. We all loved our 3 hours at the Summer Palace; the kids rented a paddle boat and took off for an hour across the lake. They also went to nightspots and other attractions on their own. My husband and I prefer a very slow, eclectic approach to sightseeing with some days spent mostly lounging around the hotel area with a short walk in the neighborhood and a stop at a nearby coffee shop. If we feel like tackling a challenging attraction after breakfast, we go. If not, we choose something easier on the mind and body. In our 50s, we no longer push ourselves 16 hours a day seeing everything humanly possible. Beijing is has so many outstanding parks, gardens, temples, and museums, that serious nonshoppers like ourselves could visit a different attraction each day for a month and not tire of the city. Although we did not visit Beijing to shop, we did find that prices in the better stores were at least as high as those in the US. The main difference seems to be that Beijing stores offer many items you cant easily find in the US.Electrical Outlets in the RoomsWe could not find specific into about this before arriving and were relieved to receive a four plug power strip when we checked in. It had the most wonderful plug holes that must fit just about any kind of plug. Just be careful that whatever you plug in has a converter built in or it may be fried by the different voltage. We charged our laptop, cell phone and cameras every day with this strip. The bathroom had the same ingenious plug. Hotel Health Club and PoolThese facilities are on the 5th floor and open at 10AM. The swimming pool is long enough for laps, but there are no lane markers on the bottom, and one side is not straight. If you are extremely nearsided, watch out for the small children who make excellent moving targets. They do not allow pool shoes for walking in the water, and everyone must wear a cap. The water and room temp seemed a tad cold both times I was in the pool. My son used the gym and said it was okay, so I cant vouch for it. SummaryThe Beijing Courtyard provided a perfect base for our first 10 nights in China. It is a safe haven at an affordable price for tourists from all over the world. If a visit to China frightens you, this hotel can help overcome your fear of the unknown. We appreciated the quiet refuge from an extremely noisy metropolis."
15,20,"Sep 25 2009 	Fantastic Location 	The typical Marriott Courtyard, whch means you know what to expect. Accpetable but not exceptional. However, this hotel's location is fantastic. Within walking distance of the Beijing Railway Station (6 long blocks), or 2 subway stops on Line #2. Subway station for lines #2 &amp; #5 are directly on the corner by the hotel, so its is very easy to travel all over Beijing, which has a great subway system that is easy to use &amp; understand, Also easy to take the Airport Express Subway upon arrival, to the connection for Line #2, &amp; then 5 stops directly to the corner by the hotel. 25 Yuan for the Airport Express &amp; then 2 Yuan for Line 2 to the hotel. About $4 USD total for the entire trip from the airport to the hotel, which doesn't get much better. Hotel is part of the New World Shopping Center, which includes the usual US offerings of Starbucks, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, KFC &amp; Haagen Dazi that is important to you. Great inexpensive Noodle Shop on 1st floor, as well as other local restaurants all through the area. Origus, on the 2nd floor next door, has a pleasant $7 buffet with a large variety. Also a great local food market on the 1st floor of the building next door to the hotel, which is worth a visit. Anything &amp; everything that the locals like, as well as lots of variety of tourists. There is also a small grocery store inside the market for snacks &amp; drinks for your room. I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation, since you know what you are getting &amp; there are no surprises, &amp; the location is unbeatable."
16,20,"Aug 9 2009 	4 Stars?	I'm concerned as to how Courtyard by Marriott Beijing managed to receive 4 stars, the location is acceptable though for a 4 star it may be wholly inadequate; located on a small side road that many taxi drivers have not heard of. Service was adequate however they need to be asked to respond e.g. they didn't help us with the, initially, confusing elevator system where you can only reach the floor of your room (unhelpful considering I went with a cousin who lived in his own room two floors above) neither did they mention breakfast. Cleanliness is Courtyard's weakness in my opinion, though by no means a dump it vastly does not resemble the 4 stars I've lived in in the past. Orange peels were scattered on the floor of the corridor (on the first day) inviting us to our equally smelly room! The bedsheets were not exceptionally clean whilst going back to service I found a plate of leftovers lying in the corridor for a whole day. The rooms are a nice (if not too large a) size though don't expect views in every room (as per usual). The bathrooms however are outdated, needing a major uplift. Overall Courtyard by Marriott is not an awful hotel in fact it may be quite decent comparing to other hotels in Beijing, however I do not understand how it is 4 stars. The price might not be expensive but the disappointment of staying there might hit you harder."
17,20,Aug 7 2009 	thoroughly recommended	no complaints whatsoevercentral location part of shopping centre - full range shops/services on sitewell appointed and maintainedcomfortable and quiet roomsupgrade to executive floor good value at 20 per room per nightexcellent breakfasts would stay here again
18,20,Aug 6 2009 	Value for money and very Central	Made booking direct with the hotel - got a really great deal - was so impressed intially were going to be there for 5 days ended up staying 10 days. Nice roomy hotel - breakfast is a challange but there are food halls in the same building - level 5. There is also a supermarket where you can get any thing cheaply. The pool also on level 5 - nice and quite - the only thing which was a little weird - you have to wear a cap when you go in the pool - sad - why not ensure all who use the pool was and shower proir to entry. Nothing really to add but worth staying here and enjoying Beijing.
19,20,"Jul 29 2009 	Location good but hotel could be better.	My wife and I stayed in Beijing with our 11 year old son. The hotel was booked as part of a three week tour, organised by Thomas Cook. The hotel was clean and tidy, and the rooms were a moderate size. The staff spoke reasonable English, and all the basics were covered well. Breakfast, included in our deal, was adequate, but we would advise you to get down reasonably early as some of the food suffers from sitting about for an hour or two if you arrive towards the end of breakfast. The range of food available in the evening and through room services is rather limited. The indoor pool, though clean, was rather cool and a little dark. You also have to walk through the edge of a shopping mall to get to the pool from the main elevators, so wear a bathrobe! The main selling point of this hotel is location; close to Tiananmen Square and the Temple of Heaven, and right next to a subway station, which is very important because it is too hot to walk very far in July, and traffic in Beijing is rather congested. All in all, this is a reasonable hotel, providing value accommodation in a good location, but there are better equipped hotels available in Beijing."
20,20,"Jul 25 2009 	Hotel great and found wonderful guide	Room very comfortable. Great location (centrally located, near huge mall &amp; close to McDonalds, Starbucks, Pizza Hut- also many Chinese restauants too of course) Grocery store in basement of mall. Hotel had wonderful service, clean neat, very helpful staff, all the ammenties. Easy to get taxis which are inexpensive and subway station around corner (very easy to navigate but get a map on intranet BEFORE you go)Guide Lei Wu $35/day was a godsend ([--] ) met us at hotel daily, spoke wonderful english, honest and VERY well versed -saved us significant money and helped us to have a great vacation."
21,20,"Jun 23 2009 	*great place to stay in Beijing*	Great hotel. Location: Fantastic, near Tianemen Square (bout ten minutes by taxi). Bout two n half hours from Great Wall Mutainy (by private car hire). Inside hotel is inside shopping mall. Lots of shopping also nearby outside of the mall. Resturants plenty. Staff great. Beds so-so, like most beds in Asia a bit on the hard side. Great basis overall for a stay in Bejing, really enjoyed the trip and the hotel."
22,20,"Jun 14 2009 	Great location for the price	We booked with the hotel directly online &amp; paid about USD70 per night (room only) which is truly unbeatable value. Hotel is located in a shopping mall complex. Supermarket in the basement to pick up necessities. Metro is right outside. Mcdonalds (24 hrs), Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut &amp; local eateries surround the hotel. A local food court is on the 5th floor. A new western style mall across the road with more food &amp; shopping options (e.g. H&amp;M was going to open).Room was a good size. Wardrobe was tired looking &amp; so was the bathroom but otherwise very clean. Housekeeping was very responsive. They usually delivered within 5-10 mins each time after we called.A good sized pool is located in a separate health club on the 5th floor. Free to use but you need to hand over your room key in exchange for a towel. Need a swim cap or they won't let you swim. Gym is also located here but we didn't use it.Front desk &amp; concierge were very polite &amp; helpful.Would recommend the hotel if you are not looking for 5* luxury but value for your dollar in a convenient location to all the sights (by train or taxi)."
23,20,"Jun 6 2009 	Very basic - Certainly Not a business hotel!	I stayed here for 5 nights as part of a business trip, and having stayed in a number of Marriott hotels across Asia I was sorely disappointed. Check in was slow and staff throughout the hotel spoke very little english which surprised me given that it was promoted as a suitable hotel for international business travellers.I stayed in an executive room, which was no different from a standard room, but rather more expensive as they provided free internet access, which wasn't wireless, and chargeable, only to be removed at check-out (adding to the delay). Just one 300ml bottle of water is provided each day, unlike in other hotels I have stayed in in Beijing, which I thought was mean for an exective room, where I was paying almost 100 per night (bed and breakfast).I was particularly upset to be called by reception before 9am the morning after arrival to remind me to pay for the extra room I had booked. This was despite the fact I was staying a subsequent 4 days (which had been booked and paid for), it was a Sunday and we had arrived the previous day from London.... The executive lounge windows were too filthy for a view, and did not appear to be anything other than a top floor room with a coffee machine and cheese on cocktail sticks....There were two options for breakfast: a paltry selection in the executive lounge or the second floor resaturant which had more choice. The Business Centre is very badly serviced, to book the meeting room was pricey, as was printing and photocopying; although this is to be expected in international hotels, one does expect the facilities to work properly. The printer was substandard and therefore documents had to be emailed to one of the reception staff's personal account, who then downloaded it to print on the receptionist's printer. This, I guess, was good of the staff to do, but again, not the facilities or service that I had understoond would be provided.The gym is adequate, although opening hours are 10am-9.30pm, so no good if you are looking to use it before work. The pool is a good size.In future I would not stay here for business. It is adequate if you are sightseeing and are just after a comfortable bed, but certainly not suitable if you require professional service, help with luggage without asking several times, business facilities that work effectively and staff that can understand requests."
24,20,"May 11 2009 	Perfect Hotel !!	This hotel is in the center of everything! 10mn to Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven... and much more!! easy access to subway, friendly staff (sometimes difficult to communicate) very clean. Though you have to pay separate for breakfast and internet :( - not included in my reservation package. honest cab drivers in front of hotel. Hotel provides map and places of interest. very friendly bell boys. Please stay here if you want to have it easy in Beijingp.s: taxi driver had a hard time finding hotel entrance (about 120RMB from Airport)"
25,20,"Apr 5 2009 	Great English Wonderful Location Extemely Happy with Hotel	Excellent location. Excellent concierge (bellman). Excellent room. Mariott Courtyard exceeded our expectations. Lots of shops and restaurants surround hotel. Bellmen speak great English and told us with how to get everywhere. They even made our plane and train reservations for furthur China Travel. Rooms were clean, large, and beds comfortable. Business Center has high speed computers (you pay to use them). Subway for 2 lines was less than 2 blocks away. Easy Subway to take everywhere. 5 star hotel for price and location!"
26,20,"Mar 16 2009 	Perfect location	I was in Beijing for leisure and chose this hotel for its good location and low price. The hotel was even better situated than anticipated with two subway lines within 100 meters. Good restaurants, supermarket and shopping mall is located within 5 minutes walking distance. The staff is friendly and language was no issue. Taxi drivers do not read or speak english, so make sure to have the hotels phone number (or the hotel written in mandarin) when taking taxi from the airport such that they can explain the driver where to go (approx. 100 RMB). The roads are pretty large in Beijing, so the traffic can be noisy, hence make sure to live in a high floor. I lived in 10th floor and could barely hear any traffic. I will definitively stay at this hotel at my next visit in Beijing."
27,20,"Mar 2 2009 	Great hotel but not Marriott service	After reading some mixed reviews I went with an open mind. It's really easy to find once you know how! I read on here to leave exit D from the subway, it depends which line you are on. If you are coming from the airport dont use this exit. The best thing to do is to exit and look for the big high rise hospital, turn you back towards that and walk forward. The entrance to the hotel is not at the front, it's round the back of the shopping centre. The lobby is fine yet sometimes a little Smokey. There was no help from staff when I arrived with my bags, all the staff do speak basic English and were pleasant but lacked warmth and charm. They do not go out their way to welcome you however they are not rude. I had a refurbed room on the 10th floor which was excellent. Very spacious, flat screen TV and view was fine. The location is good but as others mention even on the 10th floor it can be noisy from the traffic. The use of the swimming pool and sauna is good on the 5th floor but ensure you take a swimming cap otherwise you cant use the pool. The breakfast buffet was nicely presented and had good choice. The price of the mini bar is extreme. You can pay 3.60 for a coke or take the lift to the supermarket on the basement and get one for 22pence. Internet is over priced at 8 a day and is very slow. There are some internet places very near but connection is not as fast as the UK anywhere in Beijing. Taxi's are very cheap but ensure they use their meter and 98% dont speak English so make sure the hotel write down where you want to go. You can use the metro and one ride is only 20 pence. As you come out of the hotel lobby and there is a very nice respectable foot massage and general massage spa which is not expensive but has very good surroundings. There are plenty of restaurants around this area."
28,20,"Jan 31 2009 	An Okay Stay but not a great value	As a gold level member I booked this stay with points and stayed one night. I would not pay the asking rate for this room. The staff speak English and are very polite and helpful. The rooms and towels do smell of smoke and even though all Marriott properties are indicated as smoke free there were ashtrays everywhere in the room. I ordered room service and the waffles were pancakes which is not a critical mistake but the orange juice was bitter, the coffee was obviously a powdered mix and the price was 300 RMB. In addition I had to call room service after waiting almost an hour for what was to be a half hour delivery. The Internet service which is usually free for Gold level members was 40 RMB for an hr. and 80 for a day. The standard robes and slippers etc were there. The bathroom was old and outdated for a Marriott. The beds sleep OK.I will not stay at this hotel again. There are other Chinese brand hotels that have better service and better food."
29,20,"Dec 31 2008 	Great Convenient Location in Heart of Beijing	This hotel was recently renovated so the rooms are clean and well designed. Renovation still ongoing in some parts of hotel between 8:30AM and 6:30PM for those afternoon sleepers. Some comments indicate hard beds (and they are) we mentioned this to the front desk and 10minutes later a nice foam pad was put on our bed. The price was great for the standard of hotel (~65USD/nt). It was centrally located to all the tourist sites and subway was only 200m away and very convenient (line 5 exit D be prepared for a few steps). Staff was very helpful and efficient at checkin. We arrived at 7:30AM and room was ready, also they were accomodating to late checkout. Maybe the staff has changed since prior reviews mentioned slow checkin. Great foodcourt and supermarket in mall attached to hotel. There are also some great restaurants within a few minute walk. Breakfast plenty of options outside hotel (supermarket opens at 8:30AM). Beinfugie (famous peking duck in New World Mall 2 3rd floor), Asjean Noodles, Chinese Neighborhood restaurant out hotel turn right then quick left 100m down street on righthand side. Nice spa 50m from hotel out hotel to the left. Taxi ride to foodstreet, sunday market, and most other places all under 20Yuan (~3USD). Watchout for black taxi's parked in front of hotel they seem to be more pushy and seem to take the long way (we compared between green/yellow taxi to same place). Taxis are frequent in front of hotel or just around corner from hotel."
30,20,"Nov 6 2008	well located better than these reviews suggest	having looked on here at what other people said, i was pleasantly surprised by what we found. the hotel is right in the centre (not that there really is one) of beijing, just a few minutes from chongwengmen station, which is perfect as it has two underground lines serving it, north and west bound. everyone was helpful and nice, english was mostly not an issue here, and the room was big and comfy. the bed especially. didnt try the restaurant and the bar is soulless, but there is a health centre and the shopping mall actually attached to the hotel which is perfect should you need them. there is free use of a swimming pool"
31,20,"Nov 1 2008 	no air	I spend four nights here in mid-October 2008. It is a very nice hotel, but when I arrived the weather was muggy and warm. To my surprise the hotel was very hot. My room was extremely uncomfortable. When I talked to the desk they said that the air conditioning had been turned off for the season and could not be turned on again until late Spring 2009. My room has two windows, but only one opened a little at the bottom. I could not get any air circulation. I inquired about a fam and was told that none were available. My stay was very uncomfortable until it rained late on the third day of my stay. The rain cooled the city down and I was finally able to get some sleep. I will never stay here again."
32,20,"Oct 28 2008 	Slowest Check In Ever Witnessed	The location of this hotel really can not be beat for the money. It is a half block from the Chong Wen Men subway station, there is plenty of good shopping and restaurants nearby and although it would be a long walk, it is near the Temple of Heaven and the Forbidden City. The rooms are of decent size and the most of the rooms offer great views of the city. Make sure you get a higher floor because the streets are are very noisy and busy. The rooms are clean and come very well equipped, including toothbrushes and toothpaste. If there is one bad thing about the rooms is that the beds are very hard, but that seems typical for China. All this being said, you can experience this good hotel only once you have checked in, which could be a little trying on the patience. First they have to look something up on the computer, then several pieces of paper have to be written out, then back to the computer, more paper is filled out, another computer is logged onto, your passports are then examined, more paperwork, then finally the last computer seems to issue you room information. All of this efficiency is easily done with no less then 5 front desk clerks working on my one reservation. Luckily no one else was attempting to check in at the time, or else this may have overloaded the system. All-in-all this was a great hotel to stay at. The breakfast buffets were ok at $15, but lacked fresh fruit and oatmeal. Oh and one more thing, stay away from the doughnuts!"
33,20,"Oct 24 2008 	The Worst Hotel in China	This is the worst hotel I have stayed in in China and in Asia.The checkin is terrible. Took 25 minutes. Staff has terrible attitude, never smile, do not like to assist and are generally abnoxious.This is more like a people factory than a hotel so do not expect any service.The breakfast is terrible with the lowest quality produce. The a la carte is equally horrible.Housekeeping does not refresh the amenities in the room and these are of the lowest quality like you would find in 1 star hotels.The hotel is 9 years old but the rooms (even executive level rooms) are worn and torn with bad odors. The general feeling in the room is that is is old and dirty.Concierge does not assist with local information.Almost no-one speaks english in this hotel although it belongs to an American Chain - Marriott.I would recommend staying in other hotels when coming to beijing and definitely NOT here."
34,20,"Oct 21 2008 	Convenient location nice rooms	We stayed here for 4 nights and were pleased with our experience.Very convenient to the subway, which was fast and clean, and also next the New World shopping center which has a supermarket and food court level if you don't feel like going to a restaurant for dinner.We also dined at the peking duck restaurant across the street during our stay and it was delicious. The restaurants in Beijing have a report card style hygiene rating system, which should be prominently displayed at their entrance, so you can check out whether they're an A or a D before you make your dining decision.I like a firm mattress so I didn't find the bed too hard as mentioned by other posters. I enjoyed the buffet breakfast although skipped the cereal with milk given the recent melamine scandal.The concierge was helpful in translating addresses from our guide book and instructing the taxi drivers and they can give you a card with the hotel's address in Chinese.Overall I would stay here again."
35,20,"Oct 19 2008 	Excellent stay - great last days in Beijing	I was very hesitant about booking this hotel from the older reviews but finally decided to give it a shot since it seemed to redeem itself to more recent reviewers/visitors. The hotel did not disappoint and I had an excellent stay here, along with my two other travelling partners.We booked the hotel via Expedia and the rate was quite good  coming to about 45 per person  two double rooms divided by 3 for two nights. Since the Olympics had ended the week prior, the rates had dropped and this hotel was in an excellent location as well.At check-in, I was still a bit hesitant on how the hotel was going to be, especially because the front desk staff seemed a bit disorganized and understaffed. If you know Asian hotels, there is usually a surplus of employees all around the lobby to bow, answer questions and never a queue at reception. However, once we were seen to, the front desk clerk was very courteous and obliged my request for a recently renovated room. This was a tip from a TripAdvisor review and it was a good one. The room was excellent, was on the corner of the building and was very recently refurbished. It had some great furniture and was spotless. Business centre was good but internet access was expensive, like usual. Breakfast was so-so and the choice was not huge but had some western and Asian options. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre which was a really nice bonus and allowed us to drop off purchases before continuing with site seeing. The hotel also shares a gym in the shopping centre which was very well appointed.We explored the area around the hotel the night before departure, which was a shame because it actually had quite a lot to offer. This included a medium sized indoor market which had some wonderful food stalls inside where fresh food was being prepared. It was very interesting. Otherwise, there is an excellent massage complex on the same road as the Marriott which had top notch service and excellent prices. I went each day for a massage at this place.All in all, a great stay at this hotel and I would definitely stay there again."
36,20,"Oct 13 2008	Great Location Disappointing Level of Service	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, the first time was 2 years ago and we had no problems what so ever and enjoyed our stayGenerally the hotel, is of good standard, clean, average food but great central location for getting out and about around Beijing.The level of customer service however really lets this hotel down and unfortunately because of this I would probably not recommend this hotel to anyone and certainly would not stay there again myself.We checked in at 8.15pm, there were 4 of us and 2 rooms had been booked. First of all they said we had only got one room booked (our confirmation from their web page said 2 rooms) and they hadn't got a clean room available for us (check out time is 12 noon so more than 8 hours after check out rooms still weren'y ready). We asked to speak to the Manager who eventually found us 2 rooms, one with an upgrade, the upgrade however was on the executive floor but with no executive lounge access in fact it was exactly the same as the room we had originally booked but on a different floor. It took us over an hour to check in, once checked we proceeded to our room and got stuck in one lift and then the other lift wouldn't work.Breakfast was totally over priced at around 13.The attitude of reception staff, concierge etc was disgusting in fact they were quite rude. The reception staff also gave the impression that they were trainees as none of them seemed to know what they were doing or what was going on.So unfortunately due to this experience I would not give this hotel one more penny of my money, they don't deserve it which is a shame really because it used to be a really good alround hotel"
37,20,"Oct 9 2008 	Tips learned during my stay	My friend and I booked this hotel on points back in the Spring. We had read the reviews and hoped the hotel would be updated by the time we visited during the Paralympics. Updated reviews gave us hope and they met our expectations.Taxi cab to the hotel was 89RMB + 10RMB toll. Before arriving in Beijing, I emailed the hotel for their name and address in Mandarin. You can also check with the hotel reservation desk at the airport for a translation.Upon arrival, we stopped by the front desk on the 1st floor. There were about 8 receptionists helping two sets of guests and it was taking quite some time. When it was our turn the receptionist told us to head to the reception on the 16th floor for check in. If you are a platinum or gold elite member, I would recommend you make a beeline for the 16th floor. Once up there, we found the reception in the lounge and even with 3 receptionists helping us it took a bit of time. At least the lounge is quiet and comfortable. I would also recommend you ask for a hotel business card as it has the English and Mandarin names of the hotel and major sites near the hotel.We received upgraded rooms on the 15th floor. When entering the room stick your room key in the slot by the door to activate the lights. The renovated rooms were very nice. There was a flat screen tv with lots of English channels. There was a safe in the closet. Music and lights could be controlled from the bed headboard. The bed was very firm so don't plop into them expecting to sink in. The bathroom didn't seem to be renovated but it was decent. The water pressure was good. I never had trouble with hot water. There's also turn down service at night.Another area where you need your room key is for the elevator. There were three elevators but only two seemed to be running at the time. In order to use the up/down buttons, you had to use your key card. The elevators ran pretty quickly. Oh and there's a charge if you lose your room key or don't return it at check out.One of the best things about the hotel was the concierge. The concierge guys also played bell boys and room service roles. They were always willing to help in any way possible and very polite. And they don't expect tips. It's incredible. For example, I asked where I could get a phone card. One concierge said he could run out and get one for me in 10 minutes. The only downside was there were some questions they couldn't answer.The business center has 4 computers and sells stamps. It's open from 7am and closes around 8 or 9pm. The concierge said there was an internet cafe down the street but we didn't check it out. Also down the street is a 7 Eleven. I recommend going there for water which was 1.20 RMB per bottle. It's 3RMB at tourist sites; similar to the ratio in the US. 3RMB is still a rocking price though.The business center also has phone service but I used the phone in my room instead. Calls to numbers in Beijing were incredibly cheap (~0.20RMB/min). And I got reimbursed for them when I checked out. (Don't know if it was because I am elite member or because calls within the city are reimbursed for everyone.) Calls to the US were much more expensive. (Check the hotel info book for prices.) I would recommend you get a phone card where you dial a local access number.In the morning, the lobby has coffee and tea. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. Instead we went around the corner to a 24 hour eatery called Yonghe King. You can get a combo breakfast for around 9RMB. And if you're feeling adventurous, there's an indoor market next door to Yonghe with hot food stalls and grocery shops. We also tried Ajisen Noodle next to the hotel for dinner which was pretty good but more geared to tourists. The food court at the New World mall wasn't too bad either.An entrance to the Chongwenmen subway stop is also around the corner from the hotel. It's two subway stops from Temple of Heaven Park (Tiantan East Gate) and three subway stops from Tian'anmen Square (Tian'anmen East). The subway was easy to use with free transfers. Transfering within a station could sometimes be quite a hike though so be prepared to walk. I would not recommend using the subway to get to and from the airport if you have luggage as you do go up and down stairs quite often.My only gripe about the hotel were the taxis in front of the hotel. The best rate the concierge could get us to the Mutianyu Great Wall was 800 RMB. No negotiation possible. Try negotiating with a private driver or public taxi not at the hotel to see if you can get a better rate. Also, the morning of our departure we asked for a cab to the Yashow Market (where a bus was waiting to take us to the airport). The taxis in front of the hotel were not available. The concierge had to flag down a taxi from the street."
38,20,"Oct 3 2008	Good price. Good location.	Good price and good location. A short walk from the Metro station and one stop on the metro from the Wangfujing district. Located right next to the New World Department Store complex and a Starbucks, McDonalds and KFC. Also close to great chinese restaurants within walking distance.A half mile walk from the Beijing Underground City location (which is currently closed for rennovation).The hotel staff was very helpful and wrote down nearby locations for me in Chinese to provide to my taxi driver(s).I would stay here again."
39,20,"Sep 13 2008 	Water scalding to ice in 2.0 seconds flat	Not the worst place we've stayed. Enough issues that we'd look elsewhere the next time we visit Beijing. The shower water was the most remarkable- from scalding hot to ice cold for the entire shower- and it stopped flowing not one, not two, but three times for my wife's shower- weird.The breakfast is fine, the security is good (key to operate elevator) and the staff seems fine. This is the only hotel in China I've stayed in that had service staff with a Western attitude (complaining to coworkers and frowning). Finally, we do not like the location, in the midst of the most expensive everything! We'll choose a place like the Bamboo Garden Hotel again if they have space."
40,20,"Aug 29 2008 	Great stay	Stayed three niights on 12 th floor in excellent room. Staff was polite, helpful and fluent in English as needed"
41,20,"Aug 25 2008 	Is ok but dirty smelly rooms in the lower floors	Is my second time in this hotel, dont book if is not directly with the hotel, they put you in the most terrible rooms, the internet does not work, all the rooms with dirty carpet,after make a complaint they put me in so so room in the 8 floor.This hotel is in good position in the center of china the breakfast is ok, the food at the chinese restaurant ok, but u can find a lot of restaurants around, easy acces to go to china wall and other attractions. Dont use the taxi of the hotel most of the time make a price with the taxi, in this hotel only one lady from the reception speak english, about the food is chinese if u like the occidental food is terrible like around china. The mall is connected with this hotel but the price is ok, dont try anything if u r american, everything is expensive, only the jewerly and the sourvenirs are cheap , and the problem is that nobody speak english well u can find somebody who speak at the reception of the mallOveral i can try another hotel but the price is ok, definitly i can back but i will try another hotel."
42,20,"Aug 15 2008 	Great Hotel!	Just got back from a stay at the Beijing Courtyard by Marriott for the Olympics. I was very concerned after reading other older reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised after arriving. The staff was very cordial, knew enough English to make check-in easy.They must have just completed a renovation, as the rooms were very nice. Clean, new carpets, nice size rooms. Beds are a little firm, but didn't keep me from getting a good sleep. Nice quiet nights, no noise from the streets below.Excellent western style breakfast restaurant on second floor, made to order omelettes and eggs.The best thing is the location. Subway stop literally right in front of hotel. One stop from Tiananmen Square, two stops from Pearl Market.The bathroom has a power outlet that handles US style plugs, but you may want to purchase an adaptor if you need to be charging more than one thing at a time, as the plugs in the main room are chinese style three prong (triangle) plugs.I would highly recommend this hotel. Unless you are used to four star Ritz-type hotels, this should meet most travelers' needs."
43,20,"Jul 8 2008	I like it here...	Got here yesterday. I was hesitant after reading the reviews on here, but I was quite surprised to see it very modern looking on the inside (outside facade looks like crap). My room is nice with a large queen/small king size bed, small flat screen tv, small sofa, mirrors everywhere. Internet is 80RMB/24hours if you have your laptop. Convenient to walk to large mall, haagen daz, and subway. It is humid in Beijing so pack light clothing and comfy shoes. At first I was trying to decide between the Renaissance and this hotel, and I'm glad I made this choice for my short stay.Also.............take the name of the hotel with you to the airport in Chinese if at all possible. Otherwise tell them you want the &quot;New World Courtyard Hotel&quot;Con: Staff speaks very limited English so you have to repeat things in different ways to get them to understand. Same with general population in Beijing. Took me about 30 minutes to order pekign duck to go down the road..."
44,20,"Jun 7 2008	i miss the Courtyard Marriott	Originally booked thru Expedia at Fortuneland which was listed as a 3 1/2 star with Courtyard Marriott listed as 3 stars. Having travelled from the Caribbean (Trinidad) through London and Dubai and finally to Beijing - 48 hours, we were horrified at what was called a hotel at Fortuneland. It was more like a run-down brothel and beyond tacky - in fact it was filthy. We checked out immediately. As a matter of fact we never really checked in since we had a look at our &quot;rooms&quot; and decided to hunt for better accommodation. And that was the Marriott Courtyard. At first we had difficulty checking in and then caught on that we should choose upgraded rooms which we did - on the 14 and 15 th floors. Our two-week stay was without incident and quite comfortable.It is true that we were hardly ever there during the day as we were a camera crew shooting a pre-Olympic television series. But we still remember the wonderful breakfasts we had and the more pleasant members of staff.Stay at the Courtyard Marriott - you won't regret it."
45,20,"Apr 23 2008 	OK Stay	When arriving at the airport, if the new subway built for the Olympics is not yet running, you can instead take the Airport Shuttle Bus #3 for only 16RMB, get off at the last stop which is the Beijing Railway Station then walk 5 minutes to the hotel. We stayed here on free hotel points for 2 nights. The first room we got, #629, was a smoky smelling room. We called the desk and they immediately brought us the key to another room, this time clean-smelling, and on the 14th floor (where they we re-painting the hallways) with a fabulous view of the busy street corner below. It was a gigantic room, nicely appointed, with no signs of wear as others have reported, bathroom had a marble countertop, see pictures. They provided two small bottled waters, as the tap water is not drinkable in Beijing. Front desk staff spoke good English, concierge helpful with finding sights. There is an elevator. Room charge is paid at check-out. Our free room rate did not include meals. Their breakfast in the Courtyard Cafe is expensive, 100RMB, but lots of food, all you can eat buffet, and they will cook your eggs to order - it opens at 6:30AM. I saw an Internet plug in the room, but I had no PC with me. Internet service in the hotel Business Center is expensive at 30RMB($5USD) for 30 minutes. We found an Internet place in a department store on the busy corner - it was very smoky, but very inexpensive. Couldn't find any more reasonable place to do Internet. The hotel is about 5 minutes from a subway station. You can either take that 1 stop or walk about 30 minutes to reach Tiananmen Square. The Temple of Heaven is about a 10-minute walk from the hotel."
46,20,"Mar 15 2008 	Very Nice for a Great Price	After reading the reviews on this site I was a bit skeptical but I decided to give it a shot. I was very glad I did. Yes the hotel is in need of some work but they are remodeling the whole hotel and it will be finished by June 2008.When we arrived they allowed us to check out the room. It was large and clean on an upper floor. The carpet looked worn but all the rooms are due to get new carpet in the renovations. I had been in e-mail contact with the hotel before my trip and had told them that my wife's birthday was soon. The hotel manager arranged for a wonderful cake to be in our room upon arrival AT NO CHARGE. The hotel is right next to a large mall that you can enter from the second floor of the hotel. WIthin 1 block of the hotel are many places to eat including McDonald, Pizza Hut, and Subways. Remember that ifyou want to try local food, most people do not speak english and the menus are in Chinese. The concierge arranged a driver and english speaking tour guide for us. The guide was named Mary and she was great. We hired the two people for 4 days at $140/day for both but this gave us exclusive use of both people and a private car.We did try the breakfast buffet once and it was unimpressive. Ths could have been because they were remodeling and had to use the main restaurant instead of the regular place.We arrived the last day of the Chinese New Year and our room had a great view of the fireworks, which lasted 5 hours.I would stay here again because of the service and location."
47,20,"Mar 3 2008 	Sketch 	The hotel is in a good location - roughly 45 minutes from the old airport but very close to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City (15 minute walk) and the Temple of Heaven.The Hadimen Hotel (just behind the hotel) is home to a great restaurant if you want peking duck.The hotel's concierge desk will help you arrange tours if you want to visit the Great Wall of China and the Ming Tombs.The onsite cafe has very poor service (slow and very unattentive). The rooms are sort of small and musty smelling. The blowdriers are hidden in the desk drawers and cannot be unplugged and moved to the bathroom or any other outlet which can be annoying since the lighting is very poor in the room.The executive lounge is very small and doesn't offer any type of nutritious items save some old fruit. The staff does not speak very good English which is quite disappointing considering that the 2008 summer Olympics will be held in this city. The front desk staff wasn't even aware that there were two airports operating in the city. There was only one helpful person who was able to provide us with fairly accurate help and directions in the entire hotel.The staff was quite snotty and slow and did not pay attention to details (I had to request the correct room key and type of room several times - even though I had an email confirmation regarding my selection).The room safe didn't work yet all the housekeeping staff appeared to have a &quot;dummy code&quot; to reset it - so be warned to have a backup plan for any valuables you may be carrying with you.Overall, the location made up for the poor customer service and lack of ambiance."
48,20,"Feb 4 2008 	Worst sleep on our trip.	On a 2 week trip to china the Courtyard Marriott was the worst hotel that we stayed at for our entire trip....Actually, probably the worst hotel I have stayed in ever. We Chose this hotel after having read reviews and knowing the carpets were worn and the beds were 'firm,' but we used points and I thought it would be worth it for only a couple days.It was a very bad decision. There are far better hotels at a cheaper rate. the lost sleep was not worth the money saved.1. Many reviews have sad the beds were firm or hard. Ok, to translate, you would be just a good sleeping on the floor.2. you would never imagine sleeping on the floor because it is very Discusting. I would not even take off my shoes. 3. If you are using points, I would suggest going for the Renaissance.4. If you are using priceline to get a great deal, don't. not worth risking staying at. Instead, try a hotel like the highly ranked Bamboo garden which TA currently shows only about $42. ( I did not stay at bamboo, just looking in retrospect at what I wish I had done)I was fooled to think that because it was a Marriott/Courtyard that it would work just fine. If you are just staying for one night, stay at your own risk. If more than one night, please try somewhere else. This is truly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in after over 500 nights in hotels in the past 3 years. My review may seem a little harsh, but I think many american travelers will go with the &quot;american brand/chain&quot; because it seems safe for it to be comfortable and up to americain standards. This hotel is not. better to go for another hotel!Please send me a PM if you have any questions.If the hotel has been renovated in the past year, I am not aware of this."
49,20,"Dec 31 2007 	Pass on the Marriott Courtyard	I am frequent business traveler and know hotel chains well. It was hard to believe this was a Marriott hotel because of the general low standards. The staff, because they were Chinese, were very courteous and responsive, but they were not well trained and all my dealings with hotel staff were disorganized. Check-in confusing at the 16th floor. I was told at the front desk I had upgrade, but it was not apparent as to what or how, and, though I can speak some Chinese, no one could explain in English. Confusion about breakfast. I rented two hotel rooms and they were just OK. One had a slow drain problem. Compared to other hotels in Beijing for the same money, this was not a good value. The lobby is not attractive and one of the computers in the business center did not have a working usb port; another did not have internet access. More confusion to find and use the gym and pool, which are located in the adjacent mall. Sign-in and the desk and find the lockers, then find you have to go back to the desk and ask for a towel. Then, back to the desk again to get a bathing cap which they charge for. I did not have money with me and gave up on swimming at that point. The Courtyard Cafe has snack bar quality food. Location is conveniently connected to the New World Shopping Center and major avenue."
50,20,"Dec 9 2007 	Priceline Will Give You This As A 4 Star	Beware! Priceline will cheat you!When you request a 4 star hotel on priceline they will give you this 3 star hotel instead. Then when you try to complain, they will not responsed.... since they have already charged your credit card, they will not work with you.Do not use priceline to book in Beijing!"
51,20,"Dec 2 2007 	No bad for the rate	We stayed here for 6 nights and we were happy with the hotel. The rooms are worn down and the beds are hard ,but all beds in China are hard. The front desk staff were helpful as well as the bellman, but you need to know a little Mandarin to get the best use from them. Our room was a corner room with two double beds. There was a seating area and ample closet space. The rooms were adequately cleaned each day and the hotel supplies a kettle, which helps becuase you can boil your own water. They charged for the internet at the business center 30 RMB for half an hour- we opted for a much cheaper intnernet cafe in the neighouhood. Bring your passports.The hotel is conveniently located next to New World Centre and is within walking distance of the Subway. Across the street is an indoor market called Origus. We bought many of our meals here - cheap and good. Just point at what you want and hand them money. NOr more than 10 RMB for a good meal. The other markets for tourists we found were twice as much. Overall, the hotel is older and not so clean. Don't expect North American standards. Service was friendly and elevators are slow. The workout facility is very modern as it is owned by a private residence next door. We booked three to a room and expected to pay and extra $40 USD for the third person, but were never charged - bonus!"
52,20,"Nov 20 2007	Look elsewhere first	My husband and I decided to make our reservations at this Courtyard Marriott based on what we thought they would live up to the Marriott standards. WRONG!!!  We had problems checking in as we went through 3 rooms before the day manager, Johnny gave us the upgrade to a junior suite. We had requested, non-smoking, queen bed and on the executive floor. All the rooms they put us in were smoking even the suite. But after spending about 3 hours to get the room we decided it wasn't worth moving again as we had traveled 13 hours to get there and we were tired. Again, Johnny did all he could to help us out and offered us the club level for breakfast/dinner.We not only had problems with the room but when we provided our credit card we were told it was declined and they wanted a cash deposit (even though the room was paid for in advance)We were told to come by later, which we did and it the credit card went through with no problems.Other than Johnny, the staff did not understand or speak english well. Very poor customer service. We even had a problem with housekeeping giving us &quot;stained&quot; towels to use.The club level was a joke. However, they did offer a good selection for breakfast. Dinner was a different story. They offered small square sandwich appetizers that were stale and the quantity that they put out was very limited (maybe 10 pieces) and the same applied to the (2) hot appetizers..very limited. It then took a long time for them to restock everything so it wasn't worth going their for a relaxing drink and appetizers.I would book this hotel as a last resort as there are other hotels in Beijing that are better however you may pay more but it should be worth it in the end."
53,20,"Oct 30 2007 	Nice Hotel Great Location Great Amenities	We were very pleased with this hotel. The location is great - about 2 small blocks from the Chongwenmen subway stop. There's a grocery store and several American, Chinese, and Japanese fast food restaurants in very close proximity so it's a great home base for your vacation. Some might say you miss out on the full cultural experience by staying in a western hotel, but the amenities such as currency exchange and the ability to make credit card cash withdrawals were a lifesaver when our ATM card wouldn't work at any of the ATMs we tried. The business center offers relatively pricey internet access (still not bad by US standards), but it's very handy for when you're in too much of a hurry to walk a couple blocks to the dirt-cheap internet cafe. The hotel concierge provides you with cards that have the hotel info printed in Chinese so you can always present those to your cab driver and get back to the hotel when you're through sightseeing. They'll also write the name of the place you want to go in Chinese. The hotel provides you with a couple tiny bottles of water a day, but I recommend going to the grocery store and picking up a larger jug to keep in the bathroom for brushing your teeth and for drinking water while you're in the room, and using the little hotel ones to carry w/ you while you're sightseeing.There were a few cons. The bed was pretty hard but we were always so tired it wasn't an issue. And there were a few carpet and mildew stains as some other reviewers noted, but we felt that the hotel room was plenty clean overall - nothing felt dirty. The bed linens, toilet, and sink area were very clean, and those are the most important in my mind. The tub was very clean except for the stains in the grout lines. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would probably stay there again if we ever find ourselves back in Beijing."
54,20,Oct 22 2007 	Not so great	The location &amp; staf were excellent. The room itself was not so great. The carpets and sofa were filthy and need replaceing. The bathroom needs upgrading and the tiles and grout had mold and mildew throughout. The beds are rock hard. Do yourself a favor and look for another hotel in the area until the management and owners address these issues.
55,20,"Sep 27 2007 	Clean Comfortable Rooms with Courteous Staff and great Executive Lounge	Having read the TA reviews and being at my first Chinese hotel, I had reasonably low expectations for this hotel. Fortunately, these expectations were quickly dismissed. The executive level room I received for 860 RMB was clean and smelled fresh, the TV had CNN and HBO, the third bed I had requested was delivered promptly, and there was an in-room refridgerator and safe. The executive lounge provided adequate breakfast and evening hor dourves with bottled water juices, sodas, beer, and wine available. My only complaint about the lounge was that they kept the refreshments refridgerator locked so that you couldn't raid the bottled water for the day like you can in other executive lounges. The front desk staff was personable and extremely helpful in sending me to an amazingly friendly cell phone store to obtain a SIM card and in recommending a tasty restaurant where a 4 course meal, beer, and sodas costed 83 RMB (11 USD)! I generally find the front desk staff more useful than the concierge and in this case they were. Change can easily be given at the front desk though one time they ran out of 20 RMB notes and had to give me 5s and 10s instead. The hotel location is impeccable being inside the Chong Wen district within walking distance from Tiananmen Square. There are several American offerings within walking distance including McDonalds and Haagen Dazs. Unfortunately, you have to pay for internet at this Courtyard unlike the Courtyards in America.Several things to note about my experiences that may differ from others. I am a Marriott Platinum member and I'm conversational in Mandarin Chinese. I know about &quot;Chinese queuing&quot; or the lack thereof and will therefore be pretty aggressive demanding attention from the staff."
56,20,"Sep 2 2007 	budget hotel	We chose to stay at this hotel because of its value, its location and it is with the Marriott chain (so there is no big surprises). We stayed for a week. Here are several points:1. Location: It has malls and a lot of restaurants downstairs. Then it is not far away from Tiananmen Square. It is also one block away from the subway station.2. Reception: The receptionists are polite and very professional. As you may, or will, experience, waiting in line is not something that can be taken for granted in Beijing. People tend to cut in line shamelessly whenever they can. Several Chinese tourists attempted to cut in front of us at the reception area when we were checking out of the hotel. I am glad that the receptionists refused to serve them unless they get back in line.3. Internet: They do not offer free internet usage. You can use the internet connection for 40RMB @ hour or 80RMB a day. However, they only have 1 cable in the room, and the system doesn't allow you to share the internet service with multiple computers. My husband and I have 2 laptops, and we have to &quot;purchase&quot; the service individually even though we were in the same room. However, if you talk to the receptionists, they can fix the problem, and reimburse you on the final bill.4. Guest rooms: The rooms are generally clean and adequately maintained (although I agree they could use some renovations and updates especially in the bathroom). There are no strange smell in the room. However, you can forget about requesting for a non-smoking room (I don't think you can get a &quot;non-smoking room&quot; anywhere in Beijing actually...).5. Common areas: The reception area is pretty nice. The elevators has strange smell in the morning, and the carpets are old. They washed the carpet in the hallway during our stay, but it seemed to look the same after they washed it....6. Concierge: They seemed to have merged bellboy and concierge together. They provide adequate service (I booked a 1-day tour to the great wall with their help). There is often no one at the concierge area, and I wonder if you can rely on them on helping you plan your sightseeing trip/route.7. Breakfast: The breakfast was too expensive for what they offer - I'd recommend just getting breakfast from the many restaurants downstairs (There is Mcdonald's downstairs, and they are opening a starbucks soon. Then, you can get Chinese style breakfast in several restaurants too).In general, we had an OK experience with this budget hotel."
57,20,"Aug 25 2007 	Rated as a 3 when it's really a 1.5 star	We just returned to Korea after staying 6 nights at the Courtyard Beijing Marriot. There are 2 nice things about the hotel. 1 is the location, it was 2 Kil from the &quot;Temple of Heaven&quot; and &quot;Pearl Market&quot;. 2 is the little lobby bar (only bar), the staff is very professional, they have a nice big flat screen where they show everynight a game show in Beijing, for contestants to win a chance to carry the torch for next years Olympics. The program is in Chinese, but it's easy to follow.Other than those two items, I was completely disappointed in our stay. They were in the middle of renovating the hotel, which the way the hotel looked, it needed this renovation about 10 years earlier. The elevators (1 was being renovated) were smelly, and the carpets were completely stained. The public restroom looked as if they may clean it once a day. The breakfast buffet (if not included will run you about 110.00 CYN for 2 adults), was nothing special. The staff looked like they were in prison and being forced to work. The egg person, didn't care if your eggs broke while he was cooking them, he would just shove them onto your plate. Once we finally got to our floor (7th) the elevator doors open to a nice wall unit. However once you make your way down the hall, you can't help but notice the shreds of carpet, the stains, the many rips all the way to your room. We had a superior room, they chose the wrong name. King size bed, small bathroom, the bathtub fixtures were rusty and chipped. There were stains on the walls, and the furiture had stains everywhere, water marks or something. They give you the normal tolietries, and a mini bar, no liquor though, some beer. They have 2 stations that are in English, other than that it's in chinese. Our rate which I booked through the Marriot website (we are rewards members) 598.00 CYN per night plus tax and fees. On Sunday morning around 7:30 am (did I mention Sunday), we were waken to construction noise of hammering and jack hammering. I called the front desk and asked them if they could stop the noice until 10:00. They firmly said no they are doing renovations. I asked to speak to the manager and received the same answer. He did however ask if we would like to upgrade to a different room right at that moment. The chinese restaurant on the second floor (both restaurants are on the 2nd floor), had a nice asian decor. We ate there only once for lunch the day of our arrival. We had the braised lamb in yellow curry which was quite good. My husband enjoys ice tea, so he had 5, the refills are not free, so his ice tea cost more than our entire meal. Check out was simple (we left at 5:00 am), we caught a taxi which ran us 180.00 CYN. The taxi driver pulls up from 1 street away from the airport. Scam at the airport is a man will offer you a cart &quot;it's free use anyway&quot;, but then he will wheel it up to the entrance and demand you pay him 50.00 CYN. So just get the cart yourself...they are located everywhere. We flew to Dunhuang for several days and returned back to Beijing. I had reservations on our return to stay at the Courtyard but after our experience there, I booked us at &quot;The Prime Hotel&quot; for 10.00 more and a larger nice room...plus their breakfast buffet was wonderful."
58,20,"Jul 27 2007	Great Location for using the Marriott points !	Walking distance from Tiananmen Square and right on a Metro station ... and on key bus routes.Typical Marriott but location was great and being one of the Courtyard Hotels a great use of Marriott Rewards. Clean rooms, good service - just what you would expect."
59,20,"Jul 16 2007	Good experience great location	Great experience overall  will stay here again if in Beijing. Felt very safe and comfortable here as a first-time visitor to China. Quiet, comfortable room with all needed amenities; A/C, cable TV, fridge (with two small bottles of complimentary water provided daily), hot pot, shower &amp; tub, desk, small couch &amp; table. Great location nearby a subway stop (one stop from Tiananmen Square), grocery store &amp; malls. Breakfast, although very pricey if not included in your room package, was a very plentiful, quality western-oriented buffet with an omelet station. The pool and health club were under renovation during our visit thus no comments and the ground floor bar/lounge was always too smoky for us so we didnt patronize it but it looked like a pleasant place to rest and have a drink. The front desk &amp; Concierge staff spoke extremely little English &amp; were not overly friendly but we found same service around China. As the guidebooks suggest, make sure to have the name &amp; address of the hotel written in Chinese (a map of the hotel &amp; surrounding area is also helpful for illiterate drivers) when venturing out. Booking a taxi directly versus through the Concierge for day trips saved us money (we negotiated USD 25.00 rate for a taxi to take us to the Mutinayu section of the Great Wall and back)."
60,20,"Jul 15 2007 	three star hotel	We stayed 5 nights in this hotel. The looby is very nice but the bedrooms need renovation. The carpets are very dirty, the furniture is run down but our queen size bed was very good. The room is fairly large. The pool was being renovated. The breakfast room is fine. The breakfast is reasonnably good, but coffee is horrible. The hotel is located on a quiet street, near a good shopping centre that has a grocery store in the basement."
61,20,"May 28 2007 	We enjoyed our stay	We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay and felt that the previous negative views we had read were unfair . The room was a good size,clean and well up to UK hotel standards . The breakfasts were excellent and the inhouse restaurant in the evening was good and reasonably priced . We liked the location -it was very near to the metro:on one occasion we walked back from the centre of Beijing and it took us about 30-45 mins. The surrounding area was very interesting - with the 2 adjoining upmarket shopping malls(one with a skating rink ! )and the massive subterranean supermarket.We felt it gave us a good feel for a very chinese innercity area and we liked walking round the area at night.The staff were pleasant at all times and we would definitely recommend it to others . Because of our concern about the negative reviews ,our travel co. would have been prepared to transfer us to another hotel if we had not liked it.However, we contacted them to tell them that we did not want to take up the offer as we were very happy with the hotel.It was a good start to our China trip."
62,20,"May 4 2007 	Acceptable Marriott Courtyard	This Marriott Courtyard is not quite the quality of the Marriott Courtyards in the US, but it was OK. The furniture in the rooms is fairly shop-worn, but the room was clean and comfortable. I was not on an executive floor, so I had to pay daily for Internet access (around $8 per day). The hotel provides free bottled water. My room had a refrigerator/mini-bar, but I do not know if all rooms had refrigerators. There was enough room to keep some food for breakfast (yogurt, juice, etc.)The hotel is in a good location - right next to a large shopping complex with a department store, supermarket, Starbucks, food court, etc. And it is close to the subway. Despite what it says on their website, you cannot walk to the Forbidden City from the hotel. However, you can walk to the Temple of Heaven from there. There is a major taxi stand right around the corner from the hotel, so there is no need for the bellman to hail a taxi."
63,20,May 4 2007	Pleasantly Surprised	I read the reviews on here after we'd booked the hotel through a travel agency in Hong Kong. I was quite worried after reading the comments but decided I was going to see the city not the hotel.When we arrived there seemed to be some confusion with the booking but they quickly dealt with that and upgraded us.Room was quite nice and better than other PRC hotels I'd stayed in. The gym/ pool was undergoing a refurb (as were two other hotels on this trip) but the other facilities we used such as the bar were good and all of the staff we encountered were very helpful.
64,20,"Mar 16 2007 	Not too bad but be aware	I got to the hotel at night, so with all the lights it looked fantastic. The frontdesk was a little cold to wards us, but I thought thats how Chinese people must be, and was too tired to really notice much. Got to the room, nice room, excellent view and a warm feeling to the room.Had a shower, and went to the restaurant for some dinner. Was told that they had closed. So went to the shopping center wich is attached to the hotel, and went down to the supermarket, on the bottom floor. Got some noodles. Went back to the room, boilt some water so I could have something to eat.Woke up feeling groggy in the morning, so went for breakfast, as I was very hungry. Got there, nobody to sign me in, so I thought I would wait a few moments. 10 minutes on, nothing. So I walked in, got my buffet breakfast, sat down at a table, when a waiter came running out, and saying, this is a private dinner room, please leave now. He ushered me out, while me other friends were walking in. Our tourguide tried to explain to the waiter that they had booked this room for breakfast, and that I was allowed to eat there. He did not believe this, and got his supervisor, they checked the books, and yes, they saw we had booked the room.As I had already plated my breakfast, I was told I could not take some more as it was all setup for our little group, and my breakfast was cold by then. I asked for toast, which I did get.The remainder of the stay was ok, except on my last day. We went on a tour and I left my mobile in the room (forgot it on the bedside table) When I got back to the room, my mobile had gone. I went to the receptio to complain, and they told me to prove it, that I did not lose it in the city. I was angry, so I called for the manager, and was told he was too busy.Got back home, explained this to my travel agent, they contacted the hotel, and claim that none of this ever happend. I know it did happen, as my friends all know it did.."
65,20,"Feb 22 2007 	Dissatisfied with Hotel	Stayed 2 nights at this hotel and was a Platinum (top tier) member of the hotel. Despite calling and confirming that we were eligible for an upgrade to a suite, when we checked in, the front desk staff were extremely rude. They flat out refused an upgrade and refused to call Marriott to confirm. They gave us a non-toll free number and told us to call ourselves but said they could not call for us. Extremely rude and unhelpful staff. Maid service did not respect the Do Not Disturb sign. The doorman never helped us with our bags when we came or when we left. The most upsetting part was that the doorman would purposely call us taxis that would try and rip us off. We took taxis several times a day for 7 days in a row and the only time we were so blatantly ripped off was from this hotel. The first time, the taxi refused to put the meter on and tried to charge us triple the rate. The second time, the taxi drove us in circles for double the regular rate. Another time, we got a driver that had ripped us off and ended up getting out of the cab and getting a taxi from the street. The rooms themselves were comfortable, and we ended up getting free internet, although, it indicated a fee was charged when you sign in, which is supposed to be free at all Courtyards."
66,20,"Nov 16 2006	Standard hotel - not as nice as some we stayed at	We always knew this hotel was going to be less desirable than all the others on our stay in China (others were 4/5 star and this was 3 star), however, we booked this hotel as it is in a central location (10RMB taxi ride away from Tianamen Square) and we were meeting up with my sister and her family who had booked here.The staff were friendly and the concierge were very helpful. They loved my two nieces (3 years old and 7 month old) and lavished much attention on them. The only aloof member of staff was the Executive Lounge manager but even she softened to the kids eventually!!!We stayed in an Executive Room on the 6th floor which was more like a standard hotel room however, everything had a tired and worn look about it. We did joke that if this was the stardard of the Executive Room we would hate to see the stardard rooms!The room was not that large considering it was an Executive and the bathroom was very shabby. We had stayed in an Executive room of a 3 star hotel in Shanghai and in comparison to that the Courtyard hotel seemed very poor.We had breakfast every morning in the Executive Lounge and this was really nice with a good selection of food and a chef to cook up any breakfast you wanted (within reason). We also had the lounge to ourselves most of the time too.The hotel is connected to a shopping centre which has leisure facilities that hotel guests can use. We used the swimming pool regularly (free to hotel guests), we mostly had it to ourselves and it was very refreshing to have a dip after a hot days sightseeing. The pool was not as nice as other hotel pools but you have to bear in mind this is a public pool, though I must say it was very clean. One point to note is take a swimming hat with you - these are mandatory no matter how little hair you have!My sister and I also had a pedicure and foot massage at the leisure centre. You could get it much cheaper elsewhere and it was a bit of a shame when even having your toe nails painted cost extra!Overall, the hotel was tired and shabby which is a shame as the location is good and they have all the right facilities with lots of shops and food places nearby."
67,20,Sep 29 2006 	My Oasis in Chaos	I was having a pretty horrible string of luck with hotels in China until I got to the Marriott. The hotel was beautiful and the service was wonderful. I also loved the breakfast buffet. I stayed in an executive room which was huge. It had a seperate living room with its own 1/2 bath. The executive room included internet and breakfast. The hotel is also near Starbucks and the Hongqiao (Pearl) Market.
68,20,"Sep 19 2006 	OK but..not up to standards	I stayed @ the Courtyard in Beijing after my stay @ the Renaissance Yangtze Hotel in Shanghai...What a difference...in the negative.The hotel overall was in 'shabby' condition, rooms as well as lobby.From the 'amenities' (or lack thereof) that existed ,I think that this happened to be one of the first 'western; hotels built in Beijing. As an 'elite' Marriott member I did not even receive the 'usual' amenities provided...morning paper as one.Although the location is not bad, close to the 'pearl market' heavenly palace and the subway ,it lacks the comforting feel which one looks forward to upon returning in the eveningNext visit to Beijing will be @ the Renaissance !"
69,20,"Sep 15 2006 	Courtyard Marriott Beijing and Beijing Review	First, I had bid for a 3 star (highest star level offered) in the Forbidden City district, but did not get a winning bid. Then, I bid for a 4 star in the Chongwen district of Beijing and got the Courtyard Marriott (at a reasonable price for a decent hotel there). It was about 100 RMB by taxi from PEK. I talk about Beijing taxis later. The lobby was nice, as most 3 and 4 star lobbies are, but our initial room was smokey with shabby carpets and wallpaper. I went to front desk and they gave me a much nicer upgraded room. The carpets here were not the newest and had a few stains, but I walk around hotel rooms wearing flip flops anyway. The hotel manager called us a couple of times to make sure we liked the new room better, and this was appreciated. We decided after seeing some of the other available hotels in this city, that actually we may have lucked out in getting the Marriott. As I believe this is a third world country, it seems the standards may be a little different than what we would expect in the US. I would suggest always staying in a &quot;4 star&quot;, at least, in Beijing, and assume that it will be more like a 2 1/2 to 3 star by US standards.The front desk staff was nice overall, but we found that there were a few that understood and spoke English better than others on staff. The concierge desk was efficient about writing down chinese translations, for destinations, on a card for the taxi excursions we took (highly recommended and also circle the destination on a map for the taxi driver).The location was great! It was nice to go to the 5th floor of the adjoining New World Mall and have a selection of little eateries to go to, also nice to walk to the Pearl Market and to the Tiennamen Square area. We felt very safe walking and often commented on how we feel a little safer than walking thru some large cities of the US. I think that justice is very severe in China, so this probably helps alot.We read a recent US article that explained how some Americans frown upon the social ettiquette of Chinese visitors to the US. I have to admit that sometimes it got tiresome, in Beijing, to get bumped by the Chinese and their bags but we came to the realization that the customs and practices are different from US standards. Can't expect another country to be like our own, can we? It's all part of the experience of visiting another country, so we enjoyed experiencing things as they are in Beijing.Bathrooms were a consistent problem as, again, they weren't up to US standards. Honestly, I as a woman, could not force myself to use them: flat on the floor, smelly, and no toilet paper/soap. Bring tissues and hand sanitizer gel for emergencies, otherwise just use the restroom back at the hotel.Taxis seem to often have their little &quot;games&quot;. They will meet you outside the markets, after you have shopped and have significant bags of purchases, and quote &quot;$80 RMB for Rush Hour&quot;. If you had taken a taxi to get there from the Marriott, you may have paid 10 to 25 RMB. You ask them to use the taxi meter, and they say it will cost more that way to get back to the hotel during rush hour. So then you are stuck not knowing what to do, so you negotiate before getting into the taxi, like we did. The next taxi will offer to take you back for $70 RMB, so then we negotiated $30 RMB. Then, you get in a taxi to go from the hotel to the airport. This driver says he will use the meter and shows you , only when asked, that the meter is starting at $10 RMB. Then the whole way to the airport, he somehow covers the meter so you cannot see it,and zeros it out at the airport before you can see the final amount. This ride cost $130 RMB. I think it's best to negotiate the total price before getting into the taxi and going to the airport. Let's not forget, too, that the driver will add about 10 to the total for the road toll. Games taxi drivers play! Oh, and how about when you show the driver the chinese translation for your destination, he seems to understand where you want to go, so you get in, and he drives around awhile before pulling over to ask to see the location on your map (meter running the whole time). Good thing the exchange rate makes the bill not too high.There is a saying: &quot;When in ______ , do as the _______ do.&quot; This would apply to China and probably other places in the world. In China, like the natives, hold your place in lines and negotiate the lowest prices.Overall, we really enjoyed the experience (once we understood the rules) and will be going back."
70,20,"Aug 30 2006 	We enjoyed it; but I can see why others didn't	We stayed here for four nights, two for free (points) and two were paid. Let me first give you the good, but keep in mind my mixed-message title above...The hotel itself is better than a typical U.S. Courtyard By Marriot (as in, the three story low-rises with minimal service but good rooms and free continental breakfast). The location is also pretty good- about a short taxi ride to Beijing's major tourist sites. Our room was fine and the internet worked without a hitch. The hotel is connected to a New World Center mall, which has some decent shopping and a very good food court with cheap and tasty (if not fancy) food. Yes, speaking Chinese might help with ordering, but the food is all pretty much in front of you- point and pay, if you aren't fluent in Mandarin. We ate dinner here twice. When we had to return to Beijing to catch our flight, we almost came back to this place (price was a bit higher, and we decided to try something different just to compare).We saw some of the other comments, and I agree that it is likely that some rooms have smoke- but this is true in many hotels in China. Its a cultural thing. If anything, I'd expect a foreign hotel to have a LOWER frequency of smoke issues. The pool is huge but COLD (by American standards). Our kids had to do laps instead of the usual lounging around just to stay warm! The pool is actually inside a health club in the attached shopping center complex- we didn't think it was a big deal to &quot;leave the building&quot; for about 50-100 feet. Bring a bathing cap, however- as a regular health club pool in China, they enforce this rule very strictly. We were sent down to the shopping mall to buy caps (which were 20-50 yuan each), but on the last day we saw others who got basic caps from the health club sold for only 10 yuan. There are some other warts here which also could turn you off. We wanted to change money downstairs and also got rebuffed a couple of times (wait for the business manager to arrive, which is not until 10AM; right now we can only exchange cash not traveler's checks, and so on.) But they did change our money eventually, so it was not all bad. As for the taxis- I agree that the cabs in front are quite routinely &quot;owner-driven&quot; cars - meaning that they work for themselves and consider the meter optional. We took a short ride, and my wife was convinced that the fare was high (she spoke Chinese the whole ride to him, and he only put the meter up because she asked him to do so). If you are worried about it, insist on a cab that you like, or you can flag a cab half a block down the street - that's what we did for our taxi ride back to the airport. I'd also note that we stayed at the HolidayInn Downtown in Beijing, and the hotel staff there also insisted that &quot;all cabs are alike.&quot; My point is that many 4 star hotels will tell you the same thing that this Marriot does. Regarding the &quot;seedy neighborhood&quot; comments- ChongWenMen is south of the center, and it is true that the south is not all great. The immediate area is fine. But we walked to the TianTan Park (less than a mile), we saw plenty of &quot;poor Beijing&quot; which doesn't make the tourism brochures. Compared to the poverty areas of the U.S. it actually isn't bad. We were approached by a beggar while walking back to the hotel. And we saw some buildings which were definitely aged and in need of repair.As far as breakfast- we never paid the big bucks which the hotel wanted. If you are willing to eat local food, I strongly encourage you to try the Yong He Da Wong restaurant just one block to the right of the hotel (ask the bellboy or concierge; on the restaurant sign theres picture of a guy who looks a little bit like an Asian Colonel Sanders). Food there is good, and at &quot;local prices&quot; (25-32 yuan each day to feed two adults and two children quite well). They also have a bacon &amp; eggs special which might pass for &quot;western food.&quot; One warning: the whole menu is in Chinese, but there are a good number of pictures, and plenty of people eating there so you could probably point to some things and have success. Yes it's long winded, but I wanted to give you the full picture. I'd say the hotel building was 4.5 star quality, neighborhood is 4 stars, staff quality 2.5-3 starts, and amenities 3-4 stars here. Overall, a good place but come with the knowledge that there may be some annoying little things here and there."
71,20,Aug 12 2006 	Much better than I expected!	After reading the last few reviews here I was very hesitant about booking this hotel but the price and location won out. We found the hotel to be typical of most Courtyards with clean and spacious rooms. The rooms had 2 double beds (small doubles!) and our roll away was set up and ready for our arrival. We took the train in from Shanghai and got to the hotel by 8am. The front desk allowed us to check in and gave us keys to our rooms even though they had not been cleaned yet - we were able to leave our bags in the rooms. The breakfast was good - typical hotel breakfast buffet. Check out was quick. The location is great - next to the mall and within walking distance from the Pearl Market (closes at 7PM though!).
72,20,"Jul 15 2006	Bitterly Disappointed	Bitterly disappointed with the Courtyard by Marriott - the level of service offered during my stay was attrocious - the toilet was leaking, stinking up the whole room and the front desk staff were unresponsive and showed no understanding for my discomfort until I raised my voice - something I should not have to do. Giggling smirking staff who repeat &quot;Sorry&quot; and then just look down and pretend to be busy is NOT the level of customer service I expect from an international hotel chain such as the Marriott.If you choose to stay here, be prepared for the stench of cigarette smoke everytime you enter the lobby and fitness club, being demanded to pay for swimming caps that you knew nothing about at check-in, stale and limp hotel breakfasts, the 40RMB/hr cost for internet access, taxi drivers not knowing the hotel by name (I speak fluent Chinese so it was not a pronounciation problem), old smelly carpet and occasional foul smells wafting through the air conditioner among other things.Clearly, management is incapable of what is required to operate and provide what is expected from a hotel of the Marriott's calibre.Do not stay here if you are used to the usual standard of the Marriott - you will be bitterly disappointed."
73,20,"Jul 13 2006	Beware: Very disappointed	I was under the impression this was to be a 4 star hotel. I see now its rated 3, but I wouldn't even give it that. More like a 2 star. The only thing going for it was the location, which was excellent, close to Pearl Market (Hung Qiao), subway and other shopping. Carpeting throughout was filthy, the lobby and elevators wreaked of smoke. Furniture in the rooms was old and worn. I concurr with the other post, watch out for the taxis. I foolishly assumed that the concierge in a Marriot hotel would not hail us a rip off taxi not using a meter, but was wrong. We jumped in at 6:30 in the morning heading to the airport half awake only to realize we got ripped off for the ride. Our previous hotel in Beijing would not use a driver without a meter, so I was off guard. Never, ever assume anything in China, even from the door step of Marriot. This is not up to Marriot standards. If you just want a clean bed to rest your head in a great location this is the place for you. But I'd try to find a true 3 or 4 star hotel near by if that's what your looking for, and pass on this one.D. Davis"
74,20,"Jun 28 2006 	Avoid at all costs	This was simply an abomination of a hotel. From the first impression of not being greeted, dirty entrance, rude doorman, terrible front desk staff. Avoid the taxi que at the fron of this hotel - or risk being ripped off. Many visitors were complaining during our stay. Also, if you enjoy the fact the the lobby seating is taken by smoking taxi drivers on break and other assorted riff-raff - this is your place. Marriott should be ashamed!!!!!! Friviolous charges on check out - and surly and confrontational service during stay. I have never encountered any Marriott brand in which customers were so worried (not just us but many others too). Unsafe - particularly at night - unsupervised entry - inattentive staff - non-existent doorman and bellcaps. A very ugly experience. Avoid this trap and stay at other hotels (both the Marriott West and Renaissance are exceptionel)."
75,20,"Jun 5 2006	Courtyard by Marriott New World is a good choice	Nice big hotel, with good location. Walking distance to &quot;the pearl marked&quot;. The hotel is connected to a big shopping centre. Several resturants in the building.Lived there for 1 week, and had a great time!"
76,20,"May 16 2006	Good and convenient hotel	The location of the hotel is perfect where it takes only one minute to the subway station. The hotel is just behind a shopping mall. Inside the mall, there are Starbucks and KFC so that we can eat at reasonable price. The room is clean although there is no Internet connection. The breakfast is up to 4-star standard."
77,20,"May 8 2006	A good hotel - but not quite up to the usual Mariott standard.	Having frequently stayed in Courtyard Marriott hotels around the world, I had high expectations of this property. Whilst it lived up to most of these expectations, there were numerous aspects which were somewhat disappointing when compared to the usual 5 star Mariott experience.There are many reasons I would stay at this hotel again. In particular, it is modern, spotlessly clean, and has an excellent location (it is only 5 minutes from the subway, 10 minutes from Wangfujing Street, and an easy 25-30 minutes from Tiananmen Square). The breakfast was superb both in quality and variety, and the hotel site also features a shopping mall, a supermarket, Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonalds. My booking was made online, and the checkin procedure was swift and efficient. I got the room I ordered, and it took no more than 5 minutes to get upstairs to the room itself. The business center, although expensive, is well equipped and useful.On the down side, the front-of-house staff were almost always surly and rude. Most of them had limited English, and they urgently need to learn how to smile! Also, the air conditioning in the room was not working properly, and only seemed to be blowing warm air around the room. Despite a maintenance request, it was not addressed during my stay. The mini-bar and coffee bar are well stocked, but for us tea drinkers, I suggest you BYO as there are no tea bags. Finally, the mattress was like sleeping on a slab of granite. This may well suit somebody who prefers a rock solid bed, but the rest of us have to suffer. Mind you, the bed linen was superb, and is a real positive.Overall, this is a modern, clean and well located property which is very good for both business and tourist guests. However, if you are anticipating the usual Marriott experience, then you may be slightly disappointed. In particular, I recommend that the staff be given some remedial training on customer satisfaction. Whist I rate it as 4 out of 5, it only just earns that score."
78,20,"Apr 24 2006	Nice Hotel	We stayed for 4 nights. Our room was a non smoking room with no odors. We were upgraded to a deluxe room with 2 double beds, a couch and bathrobes. Yes the furnishings and carpet are a bit on the older side but still in good shape. The room was spotless and daily maid service wonderful. We had a 4yr old with us and the Pizza Hut, Mc Donalds and KFC came in handy since he was not into the local food. The shoping mall and grocery store was so convient and helpful. The neighborhood was fine.The only problem was that the front desk has an excuse everyday for not exchanging our currency. They would not change anyrthing over $100 USD at a time. Always said short on money but when they opened the drawer it was full of bills.Breakfast was good. On our stay the food was fresh. Eggs made to order for you. Fruit and bread fresh and tasty.A few of the hote dishes like the noodles were lukewarm but ok. Ate dinner once in the resturant, it was just ok. You can not drink water but you were given water bottles everyday. Hotel is so close to Tian anmen Square, Forbidden City, Silk Market shopping, Temple of Heaven and the subway is a short block away.Business Center to use computers very well staffed and easy access, but not free.Lobby very nice but very very smoky. Front desk and concierge spoke good english.Check in and check out very quick and bill correct. Overall very happy with hotel and would stay here again."
79,20,"Apr 8 2006 	Very Good Hotel	This nice 4 star hotel is relatively recent (opened less than 10 years ago). I was there for business and was pleased with the service, room, and restaurants. I had a bathrobe in my room which is always nice.However if I were a tourist I would probably stay elsewhere as there is not much to do or see around the hotel. Also staying at an American hotel in China is kind of funny.To answer a previous reviewer: ALL hotels in China charge extra for internet use."
80,20,"Apr 5 2006	A typical Marriott Courtyard	A standard US style Marriott Courtyard. Close to Forbidden city and is inside a mall. There is a grocery story on the -1 floor of the mall, where you get mineral water for 2 RMB, while the hotel will charge you 38 RMB.English speaking staff with chinese culture. I called the concierge from room and asked him to send me the trip tickets to my room, since I did not want to go down. He agreed but did not show up. I called him 30 minutes later and asked him again. He agreed to come up with ticket but never showed up. Later, after an hour I went down and collected it.Internet was not free(40 RMB per hour), eventhough it was advertised for free.Everything else is pretty decent."

2,23,"Nov 4 2009 	Very nice especially Club Lounge	We stayed here for over a week as family member is living a subway stop away. Club Lounge was convenient and concierge Michelle was terrific. Hotel is 45 minutes or so from city center but subway nearby-take left going out of hotel. At big mall near Carrefours (go left out of hotel, take right on first big street Zhongguancun &amp; go on left side of street) there are modern restaurants which are very good: Bellagio, Middle 8. Also a 7/11. If you go left on Zhongguancun from hotel, there is Three Guizhou Men for dumplings. All three are modern and well known. Better yet try Ghost Street and Huajia Yiyuan as suggested by Michelle."
3,23,"Aug 19 2009 	Amazing hotel	As funny as it might sound, one of my favorite things about this hotel was coming in the front doors and feeling the coolness and smelling the fresh, softly scented air in the hotel's lobby. It just felt so good to be staying there. The room was huge, including a huge bathroom. One of the best parts is that the room was SILENT. We were exhausted on this trip and were so grateful for quality sleep. The hotel's breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious, and was a great way to start our day. The whole hotel is very well appointed with quality, stylish materials. The staff was truly nice and helpful. I have to agree with other comments about taxis not knowing where this place is, though. Even with my Chinese friends speaking to the drivers, there always seemed to be a discussion about where the hotel is. That being said, we always go where we were going. HIGHLY recommended if you don't mind taking a cab to your destination."
4,23,Aug 17 2009 	Lovely hotel 	we stayed in this hotel in July 2009. it was lovely. we had a lovely suite. it was actually one of the best suite's we have stayed in. Room was very spacious.the only thing it did not have was a spa. but We were told that there is one opening in September 2009.
5,23,"Jun 18 2009 	Excellent Hotel--highly recommended	Hi, my family of three stayed in the hotel, 11-17 June 09. This review covers price, location, facilities and staff of the hotel, plus some travel tips on Beijing. (Please note that US$1 is about 6.8 yuan.)1. HOTEL LOCATION: If you are in a tour group, location is irrelevant, since the tour bus takes you to the designated places. But if you are on your own, or decide to leave the tour group for some freedom, here you go.... This hotel is NEAR Summer Palace (25 yuan by taxi), Peking University, Tsinghua University (15 yuan by taxi) and the Olympic &quot;Bird Nest&quot;, a 20-minute subway ride away; Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen are 40 minutes away by the subway, costing 2 yuan per trip.If you are heading to the Great Wall, and you have 3 people, book a cab through the concierge. It costs at most 650 yuan or less than US$30 per person. Much has been said about the hotel's location. In reality, the existing subway, plus a new line to be completed by end 2009, makes most famous tourist destinations readily accessible from this hotel. The subway is modern, clean and has arrival/departure announcements also in English. However, do plan your subway trip to make sure everything goes smoothly. The nearest station, &quot;Zhongguancun Huangzhuang&quot; station, is a 5-minute walk from the hotel--it's on the left, when you head out of the hotel main door. Remember the subway EXIT/ENTRANCE nearest the hotel is C1. Please write this down; don't say I didn't tell you...Besides the subway, there are taxis aplenty, and they are cheap.TIP: If you have only 1 day in Beijing, visit the Great Wall in the morning, because it gives you an idea of how tough the Chinese are, and how smart they are. In the afternoon, visit Peking University or Tsinghua which are a 10-minute cab ride from the hotel. Some of the top intellectual and political Chinese leaders are alumni of these two universities. Visit Tiananmen and the Forbidden City at night using the subway (2 yuan) to get there, or catch a cab (about 50 yuan, at most.) You can't get into the Forbidden City at night, but the night view from outside is still great. A 10-minute walk away from Tiananmen is Wangfujing, Beijing's main shopping area--quite fascinating.2. PRICE. This hotel is probably one-third cheaper than a comparable downtown hotel. I would say, save your money, and use the savings to live it up! The best way to book room is via the Crowne Plaza website http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/pegzg. Look for Advance Purchase package to secure good deals. 3. FACILITIES: The hotel provides all the amenities you expect from a good hotel. The gym and heated indoor swimming pool are both very satisfactory. Valley Cafe provides a good international and Chinese spread for breakfast. If you are fortunate enough to stay in the Club floor rooms or suites, you will enjoy the benefits of the Club Lounge, which is the perfect place to relax after a morning and afternoon tour. Drinks and other refreshments are on the house. There's free internet access for club rooms and suites, but remember to bring your own notebook. I highly recommend you pay a little extra for a Club Floor room or a suite for their added comfort and amenities. When you take a rain shower in these commodious rooms, you will know that you have a better deal than the emperors in the Forbidden City. (I am not sure if rain shower is provided in all rooms.)If you come from British Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, Malaysia or Singapore, note that the electricity cycles (220-240) are the same, so you don't need an adapter. Folks from the US, you need an adapter, which you can probably borrow from the hotel. My family didn't have any problems using the internet.4. STAFF: The staff in this hotel are fabulous. They are friendly and helpful. During my stay, I relied heavily on the Concierge to assist me in my sightseeing plans and to fix any problems I encountered. The concierge staff, especially a young man named Manson Wang, went out of his way to assist me. He helped me fix a trip to the Great Wall--undoubtedly my best Beijing tour experience--and also gave me advice on restaurants and places of interest. The Club Lounge staff were consistently friendly, gracious, and professional. In particular, I give very high ratings to Sharon Wang, the Club Lounge manager, and also to her staff &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Youkee&quot;. My hotel reservation was made with the assistance of Ms Angel Ma, who made two international calls to me on the same day I made the booking inquiry. Both the Director of Marketing and Sales, Ms Georgette Ng, and the General Manager, Mr George Chiu, saw to it that my stay was comfortable, and that I received good service. Georgette welcomed my family personally on my arrival. I was also especially impressed by the fact that the GM spoke with me personally to make sure everything was OK. Many staff addressed me by my name. The unintrusive attentiveness to service was very good. All these, despite the fact that I am an ordinary customer.I spoke English to all the staff, and, yes, occasionally I could tell that they have problems understanding me, but their helpful attitude and their genuine desire to serve the guests made me very forgiving. A little patience on our part as guests, can help.Travel GuideA. TAXI. There are 75,000 cabs in Beijing, and all legal cabs have the word &quot;Taxi&quot; on top. Taxi drivers do NOT speak English; therefore, make sure the concierge staff writes down the place you are visiting and also give you a card to identify the hotel. Try to avoid touts who do not use the meter. Don't try to tell the taxi driver the name of the hotel; they will not know what you're saying. Ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel if they don't understand where you are going. Airport-to-hotel taxi fare is around 100 yuan; to repeat myself, ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel to get directions, before departing the airport. (Use body language, not English, to communicate this! If you know Chinese, need I say more....)B. TIPPING. In restaurants, this is not required; if the service is very good, you may, if you feel generous, give a 5% tip. I had a 210 yuan meal at one restaurant, gave a 10 yuan tip, and the waitress beamed with gratitude. At the hotel, no tips are required. However, I highly recommend you give a nice tip to staff who have showered you with personal attention. If you come from a country where tipping is common, then go ahead-- the local staff will not complain:)C. SAFETY: Beijing is safe. Period. D. CONVENIENCE STORES: There are two 7-Eleven just a 3-minute walk from the hotel. Ask the concierge. There is also a French supermarket store, Carrefour, a 10-minute walk away. This supermarket is modern, and very well stocked; it closes at 10PM. If you need a last minute souvenir or to buy Chinese tea, go there, or to the nearby Gate Mall. You don't have to break your wallet.E. PEKING and TSINGHUA Universities. If you are visiting these universities, ask the taxi driver to bring you to the WEST gate. That's the pretty part of the universities. The students are the amongst the best in China, or should we say, in the world; looking at them going about their daily student life was fascinating . I congratulated myself for visiting these universities.F: SHOPPING: It really doesn't make sense to spend your valuable time shopping when you should be visiting all the great sights in Beijing.G: Subway--it's safe, fast and lets you see the real people of Beijing. And the best part is that it costs less than US$0.3 per trip, regardless of the distance. This must be the most highly subsidized subway in the world, and, Dear Traveler, you are getting the subsidy too. The way to go....H. ONLY TIME FOR ONE SIGHT. If you have time for only ONE tourist sight, I would say go to the Great Wall. It shows the creativity, ability, and tenacity of the Chinese. Forbidden City and Tiananmen are number two. Don't forget, the Great Wall was built, mainly by hand, more than 2000 years ago; the Forbidden City, built in the 1400s, is a new kid on the block.I. FOOD. Ask the concierge to point you to the nearby shopping mall, &quot;Gate Mall&quot;, where there are many reasonably priced restaurants--including, oh no, KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald's. OK, there's Starbucks. Hey, this is China....I did visit three magazine-recommended restaurants: Ganges(Indian), which is good and reasonably priced; Hatsune, a Japanese restaurant, which is expensive, and moderately good; and &quot;No name&quot; Chinese restaurant, which is in an interesting setting, expensive, and moderately good.J. MONEY. You rarely hear &quot;Yuan&quot; being said. You hear mostly &quot;Kuai&quot;, which means &quot;Yuan&quot;!K. Pronunciation. Foreigners will have difficulty with the &quot;X&quot; and the &quot;Q&quot; in the transliteration of Chinese names. Well, pronounce &quot;X&quot; like &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; like &quot;Ch&quot;. So &quot;Xin&quot; becomes &quot;Sin&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; becomes &quot;Ching&quot;. Not perfect, but close enough for you to be understood. L. CROWNE PLAZA ZHONGGUANCUN---Yes.Have a pleasant stay in Beijing!"
6,23,"Jun 1 2009 	Fantastic Hotel and Staff!	My wife and I stayed in this hotel from May 29th to June 1st, 2009. We were very impressed with everything in the hotel. It's brand-new and the staff were fantastic, extremely friendly and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to see we were well cared for. We were able to get a great &quot;special&quot; rate on the hotel website. We only paid RMB 603/night and we had a great room. It was very large, the bathroom was huge, and the bed was fabulous.The hotel is located close to Qinghua University and the Qinghua Science Park, where we were doing some training over the weekend, so it is in a very convenient location if you need to be near the Science Park. The food in the main floor restaurant, where we ate one dinner and three buffet breakfasts, was okay, although we would not say it was fantastic. However, the service in the restaurant was super, especially a young female server named Ethel was super friendly. She remembered our names and called us by them each morning when she saw us in the restaurant. Actually, as I have already mentioned, all of the staff were just super. We can't say enough about this hotel, we would absolutely stay there again when in Beijing for business."

9,23,"Nov 6 2008 	Enjoyed the stay	I spent a week in the Crowne Plaza Zhongguancun. I found the rooms to be very comfortable, quiet, and overall a very positive experience. None of the taxis I took knew where it was, and I believe this is the first review of this property on TripAdvisor - I learned when I arrived that it had only been open for 1 month! They were still working on a few of the floors, and neither the pool or spa were open. The food was quite good - I only experienced the (abundant) breakfast buffet and roomservice, but I understand there are several restaurants. Service in general was a bit spotty, not just in the restaurant, but all around, as the staff seemed quite new, and English was a little weak for a number of the employees. That said, they sure tried hard!The neighborhood immediately around the hotel doesn't seem to have much to offer, so I was glad I had the comfort and fast internet connection in the hotel as a distraction!I would recommend staying here for anyone with business in this part of Beijing. However, if you business needs are across town, be forewarned that traffic can be atrocious!"
1,27,"Beijing	In march 2009 we stayed in Beijing and sleep in Forbidden Days in Beijing.The place is in the center of the city, nearby Tienanmen and the Forbidden City.This hotel is very very good - clean and the staff is very quintly.When we go back to Beijing we will absolute stay in this hotel."
2,27,"Nov 8 2009 	Decent Value In Beijing	ROOMIn May, we stayed in a Budget Queen which we booked on Agoda for about $50USD/night including taxes. The room was a half-basement, but in fact it was in the basement. There was a small window on the top of the ceiling. The drapes however didnt reach the top of the ceiling so when the sun rose at 5am, it was very bright. There is no elevator to get to the basement, so we had to lug our suitcases down and up the stairs. The room was small  there was enough space for the queen bed, a small desk and one chair. The bathroom was also small, no tub. Everything was very clean, but some of the plumbing was rusty. The bathroom has two sliding doors, but doesnt provide much privacy. The bed was too hard, but that is the standard in Asia.There was no wireless connection in the basement, but they provided a LAN line in the room and we used it to connect. It worked, but was very slow.The room had a small flat screen TV (only about 4 English speaking channels), blowdryer, hot water boiler and a safe. Aircon worked very well.SERVICEWe asked them to change the sheets one night during our 4 night stay, and they did not. They refilled the toiletries every almost night. We asked them for a simple map of Beijing. They charged us 8 Yuan for a map that you normally get for free because it was filled with advertisements. They are not very friendly when it you ask for anything. Their English is good enough to get the basics. LOCATIONThe hotel was located in between the Tiannenmen East subway station and the Wangfujing station  both are about an 8-9 minute walk. Its possible to walk to the ticket booth Forbidden City  about 20-25 minutes. The snack market (night market) is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We got breakfast at the Mall on Wangfujing Street (Bread Talk), which was very good. We never tried the hotel breakfast. For dinner we went to a the dumpling place on Nanheyan Street, north of the hotel (about a 3 minute walk). Very, very cheap (10 delicious dumplings for $1US - So $50US for a night in a basement room is finally pretty pricey for Beijing)OTHERWe traveled to the Summer Palace via subway and wouldnt recommend it if youre not under a tight budget. The subway ride with interchanges took about an hour. We couldnt hire a taxi to get from the Bagou (last station) to the summer palace because none of them would take us such a short distance (using meter). Take the bus from the Bagou station  374. Dont walk. It took us 20 minutes to walk to the entrance and then another 20 to walk to the East Gate entrance. On the return trip, we took a bike drawn carriage. He told us it was 20 yuan to the subway station and then we arrived he told us it was 40 yuan for two people. We ended up getting into a huge argument with him, which was very unpleasant."
3,27,"Nov 6 2009 	wonderful location wonderful hotel	We stayed here for 6 nights and loved it. The area is wonderful and the hotel staff was so helpful. I am a graduate student on a budget and the price was right for me, but I felt like I was getting first-class treatment. One night, one staff member even walked us to the main street to flag us a taxi and make sure they understood where to take us. They all speak excellent English and the breakfast (costs extra) is yummy if you're interested in eating at the hotel."
4,27,"Nov 4 2009 	Location is great room could be better	We stayed there for two nights in October in a standard, king sized bed on the upper floor. The bed was hard, the shower clogged and the carpet dirty. It certainly can use a makeover. The size was decent. There were windows but no view and it was close to the elevator so you can hear the door open and close. Staff was helpful depending on who you get. We had asked for a map and one would tell you that you need to buy while another would offer it free to you. The lobby was very nice and clean, if only they pay the same effort in the rooms. Aside from that, everything else was great. Location is fantastic! As others have indicated, it's close to a lot of attractions and shopping. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with lots of choices. We love the buffet breakfast. Overall, good place for a few days. Make sure you get a room far away for the elevator!"
5,27,"Oct 18 2009 	Location location location	This hotel is in a wonderful location, an easy 10 minute walk to the Forbidden City, Wangfujing, and metro station. Our family room was large and comfortable, a good breakfast was included and staff were helpful. The beds ARE very hard and taxi drivers don't know the hotel yet, so take the advice of the previous reviewer and you will not regret staying in this gem of a hotel. It is a quiet oasis in a buzzing city."
6,27,"Oct 15 2009	Lived up to its reviews	We got the recommend for this hotel from Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed in any department. Great location, good staff, free comprehensive breakfast and if you choose carefully - great room. Also the negatives proved true- hard beds and taxis seem to have difficulty finding the address. So here are my hints - if there are 2 of you and you want more room to move, book a family room. Plenty of space and well equipped and not expensive. If you have problems getting the taxi to recognise the address, ask them to take you to Wangfujing Mall. They can drop you easily and you can walk down 2 or 3 side roads which bring you out across the street from the hotel (with crossing lights if they are of any use!) Beijing is a buzz, but location has to be a key to seeing this city well."
7,27,"Oct 11 2009 	One of the most amazing locations and excellent value	As budget travellers we were concerned about finding quality, affordable accomodation in central Beijing without staying in a hostel. This hotel was quite possibly the most amazing combination of both. The hotel is central to Wangfujing St. - about a 8 minute walk east, and Tianamen Square, Mao's Maseoleum, and the Forbidden City were at 10-12 minute walk west. You are right in the middle of a hutong, and there are plenty of eating and tourist sites to visit on foot. The hotel is set in a courtyard, and the lobby and restaurant is very nice, open and clean. We stayed in an underground room which was perfectly fine, as we were out until past sunset most nights so a view wasn't neccesary at all. The bathrooms were decent size by asian standards, and the bed was also very comfortable. In the room you have an internet connection, tv and mini fridge. The hotel offers tours to most major sites, but if you are short on money I suggest looking at the tours offered in the Forbidden City Hostel, about a 5 minute walk north of the hotel. We booked a day trip to walk the Great Wall from Jinshanling to Simatai. It was a very good value. I do not suggest taking the black taxies from the hotel, as they are much more expensive to take. Just look out on the main street, as there are tons of taxis driving around."
8,27,"Oct 6 2009 	Good location but room is a bit dim	Went to stay in Days Inn from 20th till 25th Sept 2009 with 2 kids aged 12 and 8. The room that was given to me was a family room that has a queen bed and a single bed.The room is quite dim; there're only 2 table lamps and 2 ceiling lights.But the breakfast was good, and the location, it's only 7-8 minutes walk to the popular shopping Wangfujing area.The hotel staffs are very helpful especially a lady by the name of May. She helped us to make an itinerary for the 5days stay."
9,27,Sep 30 2009 	Friendly helpful service in very clean surroundings	Located just off the main road makes for a quiet location but right in the heart of Beijing. Just one block from the Forbidden City with access to there by a beautiful garden. Staff were very helpful and rooms kept very clean. Comfortable rooms. Restaurant in hotel was a bit overstretched on the one night when we had to eat there because of a curfew imposed by the authorities preparing for the big 60th CPR celebrations. food was ok - it just took a while to arrive. Perhaps they don't normally have so many guests. At any other time there are plenty of restaurants nearby and the Night Food Market is only a ten minute walk away.
10,27,"Sep 29 2009 	Great choice	This hotel is in the perfect place, as near as you can get to Tienanmen square, next to Wanfunjing road and just a few minutes from the metro station. Our room was nice and the breakfast was more than ok (for china standards). The people at the reception were always kind and ready to help you. Spoke quite good english as well. The only thing we didnt like was the visit that they arranged for us to the great wall and the ming tombs. The guide didnt get us to the tombs, only to the small museum by them and we stoped in two factories to make us shop for a long time. But the hotal is a very good choice and quite cheap for what it has to offer you."
11,27,"Sep 25 2009 	Good prIce/perfomance ration; ideal location in the heart of Beijing	The double rooms are a little bit small. For 2 Persons there is only 1 chair. But good equiped with TV, electric kettle, coffee, tea and minibar with reasonable prices. In the bathroom there are some black dots from mold. The room service is ok. The breakfast buffet ist great with chinese and western food. The best we have had in 4 weeks. The internet access is 10 RMB/hour is ok. but each printed page is also 10 RMB! The people on the front desk are very friendly and helpful and they speak sufficient englishBruno und Helga (Germany) Sept. 2009"
12,27,"Sep 3 2009 	Some fixtures shabby carpet stained dark and gloomy	We booked the last two rooms (traveled with another couple) offered at a 'special&quot; price. We didn't realise that these rooms were half floor rooms, which means that they are mostly below ground. You end up with natural light trying to get in to a very short window. It made the room very dark so that in the day you almost need a tourch! It felt pretty dingy but as we were there for only 3 nights it was ok. The carpet also was pretty dirty, and power points and other fittings were cracked or not fitted properly. We would try this place again because of the location (great location) but most definately not the half floor rooms even for another short stay. The rooms above might be better. Beds are also hard but no worse than in other asian countries."
13,27,"Sep 2 2009 	Location location......you know the rest.	3 words: location, location, location.The hotel is 5-mins walk from Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and a major shopping/restaurant district. This, in my opinion, cannot be beaten.The rooms are very comfortable, but quite standard: they have an LCD tv, air con etc. There's no internet access, but my husband and I could get free WiFi in the lobby. The hotel has a restaurant/bar, free parking and offers loads of info on tours, shows and sights. My husband and I paid a little extra and went on a private tour with guide to the Great Wall and the Ming tombs. We had a fantastic day and the guide was fab. We also booked tickets to the Kung Fu show and would definitely recommend this. Amazing!! The staff were not amazingly friendly, but were helpful when needed and would get us taxis etc.Next to the hotel here is also a charming little park that connects two roads. Lovely for a stroll and some time out, if needed.Don't expect an overwhelming hotel experience from Days Inn, but know that you'll be comfortable, well informed and in one of the best locations possible. Isn't that what it's all about?"
14,27,"Aug 8 2009 	Very good for a quick stay in Beijing	We stayed here for 3 nights in July. We paid $45 per night on Agoda and it was an amazingly good deal! The room was very clean, and the location was perfect. About a 10 minute walk to FOrbidden City and Tiennamen Square. The only problem was that the beds were rock hard, we didn't get the greatest night's rest, but aside from that everything was great. We were also able to keep our bags at the hotel desk for the day after check out. Thanks to the Days Inn."
15,27,"Jul 15 2009 	Great value great location!	This hotel was recommended by my guidebook and a great value, and they were right on. The rate was around 70 US dollars, and it is located just minutes from a subway station and several attractions, such as the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, and a famous street food location. One caveat is that most cab drivers had a hard time finding it, but there are a variety of places you can tell a cab to go that are nearby. The rooms have hard beds like you'll find in most hotels in China. The breakfast buffet, which was included in the room price was varied and substantial. The rooms are small, but sufficient. The staff at the front desk were moderately sufficient at helping with our questions. They do charge 20 RBM/hr for internet that is only so-so. You can get free wireless in the lobby."
16,27,Jul 15 2009 	great value hotel in a good location	Nice hotel which is good value for money. Its in a good central location and near the subway with good links to other sights. Quiet room with good facilities.
17,27,"Jul 13 2009 	They've got thieves working for them	Im living in Shanghai and last week stayed in this hotel. The cleanliness of the place was't really accurate. However, this just happens talking about the dirt, because the last day, my 500$ mobile phone dissapear from the drawer.It was my spanish phone and Im not really using it in China. That's why I didn't take it with me. With no time to report to police because our flight, I just had to trust hotel security staff. After a week, the only answer I've got from them is that, after watching the video recordings, 6 people had entered to the room. All were house keeping staff, and no one saw any phone. Draw your own conclusions."
18,27,"Jul 12 2009 	Only worth it if you get a good deal	We arrived last night and they did not have any record of our reservation, even though we had the printed out confirmation from the dayinn.com site which we booked through. The room they gave us is tiny, old, and stale. This morning we asked for a different room, but the new room they gave us was the exact same only a little bigger. The room would not be that bad except we are paying Y500/night. Since it was a Western hotel and considering the price, we were expecting something much nicer (plus all of the tripadvisor reviews). We could have stayed at a Chinese hotel that would be exactly the same quality for half the price of a Days Inn. If you could get the room for much less, then it would be worth it. Staff has been helpful and patent with us. Overall, no different than the Days Inns in the US. TV is nice. Walk to the main road to get a taxi."
19,27,"Jul 11 2009	Not bad for the price	My parents and I stayed here from Nov 11 - 15, 2008 so we could take in the sights of Beijing. Perhaps our experience was a little biased based upon our unpleasant arrival. We flew in from Guangzhou (where it was a comfortable temp) to a freezing Beijing and my father had left behind a suitcase with all his winter clothing! Not to mention 2 of us were already sick with what seemed to be the flu. When we flagged down a taxi at the airport, he had great difficulty understanding where the hotel was despite me having a map and the name of it written in chinese. After he made a few calls to the hotel and showed his frustration, we finally made it there after about 40 minutes. Overall, the location is pretty good and in extreme close proximity to tiannamen square and the forbidden city... but you wouldn't know this because it's located in what looks like a dark alley, which is extremely quiet. Wangfujing is also just a few streets away, so remember to check it out for great cheap eats.. and the McDonalds is also located there :) Just don't try to take pictures inside or they'll yell at you!The first room we were placed in had lights that did not work and it seemed pretty dark inside the room, so we asked a manager to switch rooms and they kindly obliged. Our second room wasn't much better, but at least one of the small lamps worked. If you like bright rooms, don't expect it from this place. I think 1 or 2 lamps were all that kept us from falling on top of one another in the mornings and late at night. The room was extremely cold and we asked to turn the heat on, but apparently there was some law in effect that Beijing could not turn heat on until Nov 15 (the day we were scheduled to leave). Regardless, we kept trying and managed to get a little heat to come out of the wall unit, but it was extremely weak and we would leave it on all day while we were out touring just so we wouldn't come back to a -20 F degree room. There is a restaurant located inside of the hotel, but we always ventured out to eat on our own and with a tourguide. Be warned, some of the locals WILL take advantage of you if they know you are a foreigner, but I guess this is to be expected. My family is Chinese, but we speak the Cantonese dialect which is not used there. Outside of the hotel, a woman sold corn on the cob and tried to up the price by a few yuan on my dad when she heard his accent.Overall, because it was just a few days, I would say that it was a pretty good bargain since we were primarily there to see a couple of main sights, but if it were more than 4 days... I would've probably reconsidered. The hotel merely served as a place to shower and sleep as they have no real amenities that I could see."
20,27,"Jun 16 2009 	Good Hotel for Reasonable Price	We spent three nights in this hotel during our recent visit to Beijing. We got a very good price booking through ctrip.com. Taxi charged 100 Yuan from the Airport which includes the toll fee. The driver had a little difficulty of finding the hotel as it is located in a side street. Walking distance to Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, Wangfujing Street and Subway station. Front desk staff is very helpful and friendly. I am not really impressed with the quality of the room. ( Hard mattresses and some areas of the room need renovation). However we used the room only for sleeping in the night as we have a busy schedule during the day time. Breakfast buffet has western and Chinese food which we really enjoyed. Considering the price we paid and location, I am really happy with our stay in this hotel."
21,27,"Jun 9 2009 	Great Location	My partner and I stayed here after checking this website. 5 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. 10 minute walk in the other direction and you're on Wangfuling Shopping Street. One warning: Don't use Taxi's at the hotel, wave one down in the front street, they are much cheaper. Also beware of the the locals out the front waiting to take you on their bikes..... they take you the long way to where you want to go and then demand a lot of money. We had to threaten them with the police. They told us the price was 3RMB and then when we got to the square they demanded 300RMB. Staff in the bar are very friendly and happy our is fantastic, buy one get one free...... Nothing is too much trouble. The walk to Shopping Mall is pleasant as is the Walking Street Market although most of the stuff is the same in each stall"
22,27,Jun 2 2009 	Can't go wrong!	Using the Days Inn Forbidden City's free internet as I type! Recommend his hotel to anyone visiting Beijing. 5 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. 10 minute walk in the other direction and you're on Wangfuling Shopping Street. Ideally located for the sightsee'er! Rooms are clean and modern. Affordable. Will stay here the next time I'm in Beijing! Recommend this hotel to one and all!
23,27,"May 24 2009 	Almost perfect	Been there for 4 nights last April. Really liked the location, breakfast, size of the room, cleanliness, amenities. Also a flat screen TV, minifridge and safe box in the room, and two complimentary bottles of water everyday in your room. So far everything perfect.The only complain that I have is related to the day when I had the buffet lunch at the Hotel (which is good and unexpensive: 48 yuan); they charged me 28 yuan for a bottle of Coke (which costs 2 or 3 yuan in the streets) ! So if you decide to have lunch at the Hotel, check the price of the beverages first, or you'll have a bad surprise (like me).Anyhow, I recommend the Hotel."
24,27,"May 16 2009 	Decent hotel right near several tourist high spots	I spent 3 nights at this hotel 4-29 -&gt; 5-2. I've re-read thru a couple reviews and generally agree with what I've read. The room I had was small with a hard bed, but reasonably nice. I had a fridge and safe, altho I never spotted a hair dryer. It really is right around the corner from tianammen (sp) square, forbidden city and wanfujing (sp) walking street etc, so it is a nice spot for independant travelers. I found the staff for the most part reasonably friendly, including front desk, restaurant and business center. They probably would have preferred to sell more tours and tickets to me, but were never rude or dismissive. I booked directly thru Days Inn website for what I thought was a good rate of around 500rmb per nite. It included a quite decent breakfast buffet (western and asian food, changed a bit from day to day.) I appreciated all the more as it was my last included breakfast in my China hotels. I also had dinner and room service from the hotel a few times and it was fine. I would steer away from the little convenience shop in the hotel, you can buy your drinks from any one of multiple convenience stores or stands on the (main) street outside the Days Inn (the one the restaurant faces.) Also, I had no problems checking in or out with the desk but that may be partially due to booking thru the Days Inn website (I generally prefer booking directly with hotels rather than 3rd parties.) There are other much lusher appearing hotels around the corner, so I would weigh the price and amenities of the Days Inn against the other hotels in making a decision. In short, it's pretty good, no reason to avoid, not sure whether you need to make a mad rush for it either. (Carpets were oddly messy in hallway. Also had two incidents with people - housekeeping, and man trying to enter my room while I was in there. Keep your bolts on while in room.)"
25,27,"May 16 2009 	Great experience at Days Inn	My wife and I spent three wonderful days at Days Inn. The staff were efficient and courteous and spoke good English. The hot breakfast was very good. The location was very convenient, close to historical places of interest. Tours were efficiently arranged by the hotel staff. The rooms were clean and adequately furnished, perhaps the air conditioner could have been better placed as we got a draft throughout the night. We shall definitely stay at the Hotel when we next visit Beijing and recommend it highly."
26,27,"May 15 2009	Location top Service not	We stayed at the Days Inn Forbidden City for a week. The hotel is difficult to find if you don't have the address in Chinese, and even then, some Taxi-drivers had trouble finding it during the week. When you arrive, the hotel looks very inviting, but this is not reflected in the rooms.We had booked a special rate, but when we arrived we were told that it is old and we would get a new rate. After several discussions, we were finally told that they would check with the booking service and in the end, we received our initial rate. The staff speaks poor English, which might be enough, but when it comes to problems, that is quite difficult. The room might have been hygienically clean, but the carpet was stained and the bathroom did not look very inviting. Houskeeping did a good job though and I did not feel uncomfortable. We did not try the food.I believe for a couple more bucks, we could have gotten something better."
27,27,"May 13 2009 	Excellent Staff great location....	Hotel staff are amazing, very helpful and always willing to assist We stayed here for 10 days so chose the budget room, which is nice n comfy but small. Rooms are in underground floor so only small window at the top, no views.Room included: lcd TV with over 60 channels (only couple English channels), kettle with tea bags, but no sugar or milk. Hair dryer provided. Safe in room, small closet enough for hanging some clothes. Torch in side drawer, free paper slippers, 2 free bottles of water per day. Bathroom was ok condition which inc complimentary toothbrush n paste, comb, shower gel and shower, soap, shower cap. Two shower heads, removal and rainforest type. No mini-bar or fridge, no iron but we requested one and it came with a ironing board (free of charge). AC in room was ok and worked fine. Bed was really hard, but we asked for another quilt and slept on that which helped a lot.Location is really good, litteraly minutes away from Tinamen and Wangfujing street.Be careful of the bike taxis that hang around there, these guys charge 300RMB per person and per tour AVOID!!Also when you do head towards the park near Tianmen square, be careful of Chinese Art students who will ask you come to their college to view their work, we kindly refused but was approached but 2 other girls with the same story, so I guess its some kind of scam"
28,27,"May 5 2009 	Fantastic value great breakfast and helpful staff	The front desk is so helpful. They arranged a car to the Great Wall, provided recommendations for restaurants, and did the little things to make our stay extra special. I like a good breakfast before a long day of walking and exploring. The buffet offers fresh fruit, a mixture of Western and local breakfast dishes, and a helpful wait staff. The omelet station is excellent. The location of the hotel is great. It is close to a subway stop, Tian'an Men Square, Forbidden City, and lots of shopping and restaurants."
29,27,"May 4 2009 	Best location I can think of and a price that I can't forget either!	Stayed here in early March 2009 for three nights during a business conference in the city proper.. First, as others have mentioned, the hotel is small, and while the &quot;Days Inn&quot; name may be recognizable to westerners-- your cab driver will most likely not know of this hotel.. however, have no fear.. you can print a good map with sufficient details for a taxi driver to use.. The hotel staff is pleasant and will try their best to accomodate you and your needs-- one note of caution-- As I have done business in almost every corner of Asia, I will note that China is still emerging and getting used to the international standards of &quot;guest service&quot;.. So, what does this mean?? If you're looking for flexibility-- say a late check out, or early check-in (without charge) forget it. -- Not that they don't *want* to help you, their system and structure just doesn't yet support such things.. Everyone was friendly enough and translated all my directions and notes so I could get around..As others have mentioned the single BEST thing about this place is the LOCATION.. which I can honestly say is excellent by every measure.. you're about a :05 walk to either the Wangfujing or Tian'anmen East station.. from there you can make connections to almost anywhere in the city.. taxis are plentiful as you're right on a major roadway.. you can take a :10 stroll to the front of Tian'amen Square and take your picture in front of the famous picture of Chmn. Mao... The tourist walking/shopping street of Wangfujing is :05 away and lots of shops and chinese/western restaurants will be found there..The hotel: It's fairly new.. the property is made up of two buildings. The main building--which also houses the restaurant and the rest of the hotel services.. and the second building-- only steps away from the main building-- is just guest rooms.. One note about the hotel's cheapest &quot;budget&quot; rooms.. they are in the second smaller building and are on the so-called first floor.. However, one odd feature is the the first floor of rooms is actually below ground, thus your window is near the ceiling and is small and looks out to the ground above.. kind of like living in a house basement-- if that kind of thing bothers you, check where your room is..I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant as there are so many good places to eat and very reasonable prices all around the hotel, but it's there is you want to eat there..The rooms: Very impressive for the price.. Very modern features, excellent bathroom, great water pressure. Split A/C, firm bed with goose down comforters.. Very clean and well maintained--- by any standard a very good hotel..Verdict: I'd stay here again- no questions asked.."
30,27,"May 1 2009 	Great Budget Hotel in a Great Location	We stayed at the Days Inn Forbidden City in Beijing for 4 days while visiting Beijing. The hotel is great. The cab ride from the airport took about 25 minutes and cost 75RMB. The driver had no idea where the hotel was located. Luckily, we had a map of the hotel and their phone number, so we called the hotel and they spoke to the driver and he took us there without a problem.The hotel's location is its best feature. It's a 10 minute walk to the Forbidden City, Tienanmen Square, and Wangfujing street. There are also many places to eat around the hotel, so that was also plus for us since we ate a lot of the traditional foods.Checking in was a breeze. It took about 5 minutes. The staff at the front desk were very nice and spoke decent English.The rooms were small, but nothing to really complain about. We had two medium sized luggages and managed just fine. You're out on vacation to explore new things, don't let a small room ruin it for you. The room has wired internet, not the best connection. The speed was sort of slow and our skype connection kept disconnecting, but for free, I really can't complainTheir breakfast buffet is delicious and highly recommended. They serve both western and eastern foods. I think it was definitely worth the $10. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and would stay there again if I was on a budget."
31,27,"Apr 5 2009 	Location Location Location	My husband and I spent seven nights at the Days Inn Forbidden City recently. We had a wonderful holiday in Beijing, helped in no small part by our choice of hotel: as many people have written, the hotel is a less than 10 minute walk to both Tiannanmen Sq. and Wangfujing Street, which is ideal in such a vast city - visitors will burn a lot of shoe leather!We checked in relatively smoothly. The main hiccough being that we had booked directly through DaysInn.com, where the website said that two breakfasts per room were included in our rate, but upon arrival no-one in the hotel seemed to know about this. It was not ideal to debate this after a long flight and with an 8 hour time difference, but we were facilitated when we showed the receptionist a print-out. Breakfast is 68RMB per person otherwise.We had a brilliant week in Beijing, ate some wonderful meals (one in particular was a stand-out: at a restaurant called Source, located in Banchang Hutong, off Dianmen Dong Dajie, and I'd really recommend it), enjoyed great company, and were in awe at the dynamism of the place. It is a city of contrasts and full of culture.Enjoy your visit!"
32,27,"Mar 3 2009 	Great Location and Helpful Staff	We took a sleeper train to Beijing on Friday night and left Sunday night, so we only needed the room for one night. Despite arriving at 8am, they were able to check us in quickly. They also helped us arrange transportation to the Great Wall at Mutianyu and recommended a good restaurant for dinner when we came back. Although unassuming from the outside and off the beaten path, Days Inn Forbidden City is close to many restaurants and shopping. It's also about a mile and a half from Tienanmen Square.The room was small, with no closets or hair dryer, but for one night, we couldn't have asked for anything better."
33,27,"Feb 23 2009 	Great location fantastic price	I stayed at Days for 7 nights in February 2009. and I must say, I'm very impressed. It is well located, being half way between Forbidden City and Wangfujing Street (about 10mins walk to either). And as per all reviews I have read, the taxi driver had difficulty finding the place, even though I had the name, address &amp; location map in Chinese. I would give this place a 4 star rating. The room was very clean, with a modern bathroom; and the free broadband in the room was a major plus. The reception staff were always willing to help out, and there was always at least one staff member available that had very good English skills.The buffet breakfast was very good yet slightly pricey, but it was convenient.The next time I stay in Beijing, Days Inn will definitely be at the top of my list of places to stay."
34,27,Feb 17 2009 	Nice place to stay away from home.	We had a nice time in this hotel the staff were very nice. Food was good it varies every morning except the bacon.
35,27,"Feb 14 2009 	Love It! Enjoyed our stay.	The reviews here at Trip Advisor is really helpful. I booked the DayInn Hotel after reading the reviews from this site. And I would say, I'm more than satisfied. The Hotel is rated as 3 star, but I would give a 4 star for this. The Room is cozy, clean, and modern. The bathroom is spacious, and I like the shower, its this new type rain thing... The reception is not big or elegant as those five star hotels, but they give such efficient service. There buffet breakfast is good, and I also recommend their lunch buffet. It's nice, and not pricey. The place is located in the center of a busy district. Very convenient to most of the places and tourist attraction like Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing Shopping district... all are walking distance, don't worry, its about 15 mins. walk. But you can always take a cab around., its cheap and it won't burn a hole in your pocket. Lastly, the most famous Peking restaurant &quot;QuanJuDe&quot; is located in Wangfujing. Just ask the reception to help you call the restaurant for an advance reservation, so that you are sure to have seat reserve for you before you go... or else the place is always packed with travelers and you'll have to wait a long line. Overall, its a nice experience staying at Forbidden City Days Inn Hotel."
36,27,"Feb 10 2009 	Days Inn in Beijing is better than Days Inn in US	My family and I stayed at the Days Inn Forbidden City in Dec. 2008.Overall, I would recommend the hotel.I'm used to the idea of a days inn in the US being a motel grade quality. Well, this particular days inn is much better than the typical US days inn. It's probably more like a Holiday Inn in the US.We had a total of 5 rooms (each having 2 twins) and they were all of varying sizes. Some had more space than the others. Unfortunately, they were all charged at the same price.The location is pretty good since it's close to the subway and Wangfujing area.For some strange reason, all the female receptionists were much more helpful than any of the male ones. This was the opinion that my entire family had (all 10 of us). The female receptionists just seemed more willing to provide assistance.If you're looking to stay near the Wangfujing area, then I would recommend this hotel. If you just need a good basic hotel in the Beijing area, then I would recommend the Ibis at Sanyuanqiao."
37,27,"Jan 10 2009 	Great Location for the price	We stayed at this hotel in March 2008. Our cab driver had a difficult time finding our hotel as the entrance is a little awkward. We had the address written in Mandarin but the cab driver still had a difficult time finding the hotel. I believe we had to drag our bags through an alley a bit to get to the front entrance. The hotel is in a great location. Very close to the Tianmmen Square and the Forbidden City. Also within walking distance to Wafujing. We were able to take a short walk to watch the flag raising in Tiananmen square.The hotel staff were helpful for the most part. Not necessarily fluent in English, but they could speak enough that we were able to get by to check in. The hotel room was nicer then we expected. The washroom was nice. The room was small, but we didn't expect a spacious room for the price."
38,27,"Jan 6 2009 	Sonny the courteous 	For a family of four, a couple and 2 toddlers, days inn forbidden is ideal and comfortable. Walking distance to wangfujing and forbidden, the homey atmosphere and friendly people of the hotel are a welcome respite every time one arrives from a day-long tour. The bedroom is warm and cozy. The bathroom is not exceptional but spick and span. There's broadband and wi-fi. The restaurant offers tsingtao and yangjin beers, good for nightcap. Food is superb if a bit expensive but worth it. Hats off to SONNY -- who took the extra effort to serve as a guide and butler -- the friendly and courteous waiter in the restaurant. I owe you 14 rmb for the taxi ride. You're an asset to the hotel. Keep it up!"
39,27,"Jan 5 2009	Fantastic location clean and cosy	I have just returned from my solo travel for 7 days at the Days Inn Forbidden City Beijing. It was quiet but yet not too far from main roads. Location was fantastic, minutes walk to the WangFujing, Tian'anmen SQ, etc, subway station, bus stops with buses that goes to many places of interest.Nearest subway is Tian'anmen Dong, take exit B. Turn left, walk along Chiangan dajie, crossed one main road, turn left on junction of Nanheyen dajie, walk for about 1 minute, you'll see the Inn on your left.Area is safe. The room is clean &amp; cosy. Staff are friendly and helpful. Overall, i would say that it's beyond my expectation."
40,27,"Jan 4 2009 	Great Location - Great Potential	The Days inn Forbidden City Beijing is a really good hotel, with good people, excellent location and really has everything going for it.So I do wonder why I cant rate it that highly. In fact in terms of value for money this hotel has the potential to be the best in Beijing in its class. It has many good points including great housekeeping, good location and free internet. There isnt even really anything that they do wrong it is just either how they explain things or what they dont do.The things that bugged me were basic easily fixed issues. For example1. We had prepaid our week stay (through a Trip adviser site) and had confirmation all money was received and booking confirmed. So when we turned up we were not allowed to check in until we paid a further 500 rmb bond. We had just flown for 16 hours and travelled by train and cab to the hotel and at 6.00am in the morning we didnt have the cash. So we had to pay on a credit card. So instead of a raving review all about arriving at our hotel at 6.00am and getting our room immediately, instead we had a negative experience. When we left we were able to get the credit reversed easily, however it could have been handled much better or advised earlier. It is not uncommon to ask to have a copy of the credit card and I would happily agree to this, but requiring cash is NOT a good practice.2. We had (based on a review) specifically booked a deluxe room with a view over the adjoining Hutong. However no one had told reception and a room was not available on check in. We were told we would be moved later that day when available. After a week we still had the same room we started in. It was a perfectly comfortable room, but was very small. The bathroom was almost bigger than the bedroom. Basically if you say something is going to happen it should be up to someone to ensure it does happen. Also the booking system should be able to record requests so front desk staff know what has been requested.3. For the European New Years Eve we asked the front desk what was on locally that we could go to and celebrate at. I was told they didnt know as foreign tourists arent their major market. Ironically I rang another hotel we had used previously in Beijing and they gave us a list of activities and also arranged our New Year trip for us free of charge! Surely there must be a central visitor information record of these things that could be posted in the lobby. Even better task a member of staff with good english to keep this up to date and offer some alternatives to all guests looking for things to do. If they sell other peoples tours the commission could even make the hotel some money. Dont get me started on why promote yourself overseas if this is not your market!4. For room service I have no problem paying the price plus an additional service charge. However the adjoining cafe/restaurant also has a 10% service fee for anything ordered, even a soft drink. I thought this could have been built into the price of the item, however the prices are already pretty steep compared with adjoining restaurants. A glass of local beer effectively costs over 30rmb with the services fee, yet a bottle (maybe three glasses) is only 25-35rmb in many local restaurants and as little as 5 rmb at the shop next door. We didnt even have a breakfast which at 68rmb was more than we paid for a meal for two nearby. A main course in the evening (150-190rmb) would have cost us more than we paid for a two course meal with drinks at another restaurant (130rmb).5. When we tried to take taxis from the forecourt they often quoted very high prices before setting off. For example a trip to the drum tower the two taxi drivers in the forecourt wanted 50rmb as a fee. So we walked off and flagged one down outside and paid 18rmb on the meter. It seemed to be a small scam where drivers parked on the foyer charged foreigners excessively.So would I recommend Days Inn Forbidden City to others? Yes, I guess so as it is a good place and has a good team. For most people it will be ideal.I would stay there again if I needed to.."
41,27,"Dec 24 2008 	Great location	Hi! We stayed at the hotel for a couple of days ,the location is definately very very good, you can spend two days visiting places within walking distance to this hotel. The hotel is new so it was well maintaines ,neat and clean.The only thing which was negative about this hotel was the size of the room,it was quite small,you hardly have place to walk if you have 2-3 luggage with you,the bathroom were nice and big in proportion to the room."
42,27,"Dec 22 2008 	Perfect location lovely cosey rooms	I stayed at this hotel about a year ago, when it was still brand new and LOVED it, it was one of my favourite hotel stays ever. I now compare all budget hotels to this one... In fact, on one of the two days I budgeted for sightseeing I got so comfortable under the fluffy duvet, watching the news on the flat screen TV, that I lost track of time and didn't leave the hotel until lunchtime, and didn't even regret it. It instantly felt like my bedroom at home, decorated in the style I like most in a hotel, with crisp white linen, clean neutral carpets, flat screen TV mounted on wall, glass shower door, big mirror... functional and minimalist and not at all kitch or mouldy or over the top. I have to add that this was a small room, more than big enough for one person, but perhaps a bit more cramped for a couple.This was a personal extension to a work trip, so I moved to the much posher Raffles hotel down the road a few days later (on work's expense) and I have to stay I missed the Days Inn which was much cosier! There was the occasional language problem and growing pains as these were the early days of the hotel, I asked for a plug adaptor (for UK plug) on my first evening and they didn't have one or didn't understand me... But they didn't just move on and forget about it: later the same evening, several hours later, they knocked on my door, having sourced one! I was quite touched by the eagerness, actually.Also, I booked the room on the internet and when I called them directly from Dubai to confirm my booking, they didn't understand me at all. But I needn't have worried, when I arrived and showed them the printout of my booking, all was well.Room service was friendly and swift; internet access in the room was free, the breakfast was a bit uninspiring but at this price, I didn't mind at all, there are plenty of eateries in the area.The location is perhaps best of all, right on top of the forbidden city as well as food street, upmarket malls etc - there is a reason why the fancy hotels like Raffles and the Grand Hyatt are located in this district and at the Days Inn you get to experience the area on a budget.Highly recommended!"
43,27,"Dec 16 2008 	Loved the Days Inn Forbidden City	I just returned from Beijng and the Days Inn Forbidden City is the place to stay... Walking distance from Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City and WangFuJing Street it's a great spot to the those who visit Beijing...The staff is very nice, english friendly and you'll feel like home."
44,27,"Dec 10 2008 	Good location small rooms	The location is very good. About 5-10 Minutes walk to either TianAnMen or WangFuJing. Closest subway is TianAnMen Dong, about 5 Minutes away.The location is quite quiet. However, when I was there there was a construction site right next to my Window that started working at 07:00am. After I moved my room to the other side of the building it was OK.The budged rooms are basically below ground level and have very small windows near the ceiling. Means rooms are quite dark. Rooms are also extremely small. But still OK value. On the plus side, the room safe could fit my 13&quot; notebook.The hotel is in OK shape. Staff is very friendly. The breakfast was good, but at RMB68 not exactly cheap.I am not sure if I would stay again. Next time I may stay again in Days Inn Joiest."
45,27,Dec 8 2008 	Can't beat the location	This hotel is in the perfect location to see Beijing. You can easily walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. The hotel itself is adequate and it is only a Days Inn but for a newer property (opened in 2007) it is already falling apart. My shower was leaky and had mildew and the carpet of the room was stained. I've stayed in many worse places but it seems like they cut corners on maintenance and upkeep. The staff was helpful and had decent English. The hotel breakfast is only about $10 a person but my family of four walked down the street each morning to a nearby dumpling restaurant and ate well for $10 total. You can't do better for the location but you can likely do better for the price. If I traveled with family I would likely stay here again. If I was by myself or just with my spouse I would likely look elsewhere.
46,27,"Dec 6 2008 	Very nice and comfortable!	I stayed at the Days Inn for 7 nights in October/November 2008.I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel.We had a standard double room at the 3rd floor, we had a nice view over the hutongs from our window.Our room was nice, very modern, normal size. We had one queen bed, not so big, but comfortable.The flat TV - screen only offered 2 english channels, out of 60 channels that were on chinese.Everything in the room was clean, except the floor, there were many hair in the floor and some in the bed too. The hotel offered slippers, we used them so the hair in the floor were not a problem.Breakfast was not included, so we payed for it every morning, it was a little expensive, but they had a big selection so it was worth it, we payed around 70 Yuan per person. The staff was nice and most of them speaked english, great if you want to ask something. We booked a tour to the Great Wall in the reception, I don't remember the price, just that it was quite cheap. The tour was fun, but we only haved 1  hour on the wall, it was too little. I would recommend to hire a cab and do a private tour to the wall instead.The reason for my trip to China, was actually of my mother's 50th birthday... On her birthday, the staff had left a really nice birthday cake in our room, so we got a real surprise when we got back to our room in the evening and discovered a cake! :-)I definitely recommend a stay att the Days Inn hotel, very nice and just 5 minutes to Wang Fu Jing Street and 10 minutes to the Forbidden City. There were always some cabs outside the hotel or on the street... My only complaint about this hotel is about the deposit the hotel wanted the first day when we checked in, I don't know if this is normal in China, but I thinked it was a little strange. The staff said the deposit for one day was 115 yuan, so they asked for 1.000 yuan in deposit for our stay, it's more than 115 per day, so I really don't understand it. But we had to give them 1.000 yuan in deposit, this was not fun, because we could have spend the money on our vacation... we had them back when we checked out, but we were going home then, so you couldn't spend them... that was really stupid, at least I think so... This is the only thing I didn't liked with the hotel, if you're going to stay at this hotel bring some extra yuan for the deposit....!I don't think you're going to regret if you book this hotel, it's great, if you disregard from the deposit!"
47,27,"Nov 24 2008 	Expectations met	Stayed here for 4 nights with my wife, we found it a pleasant surprise as it was in the perfect location right near both Tiananmen Square/Forbidden City and Wangfujing shopping district.The hotel was quite modern and clean, the staff were helpful and overall exceeded our expectations as this is not a 5 star hotel. Our room was on the ground floor and slightly small but quite cosy, everything looks new and modern with everything we needed (no more no less). Only problem in our room was that our window faced the rear of the hotel which is in fact the Hutong area. As such, in the mornings it was quite noisy and we could not open our curtains otherwise people could see in.overall we enjoyed our stay here and could not recommend a better place."
48,27,"Nov 24 2008 	Good location but not so good hotel	We stayed at Days Inn Forbidden City in November 2008.The location is really good, about 10 minutes walking from Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square.The hotel is not so good.* The room was too hot because of the heater.We asked the staff to adjust it, but nothing was done.We turned off all the heaters of the room by ourselves but the central heater was enough to keep the room hot. We had to open the window to breath.* There was a construction right in front of our room and the workers there used to work at 3:00 am making a lot of noise!* After shower the bathroom was a mess - water on the entire bathroom flor, the box was leaking.* The carpets was dirty.* Breakfast wasn't included and was expensive for what they offer."
49,27,Nov 23 2008 	great staff	near tiananmen square and forbidden city. Rooms could be a little bit bigger and the bathroom door is bad.The staff is very friendly and helpful.
50,27,"Nov 20 2008 	Good location but not a great hotel	It looks that Days Inn have tried to go upscale with a pretty hotel. The problem is that it looks already 15 years old. As much as I love China (I spent my last 2 holidays there) it seems that they have the ability to make new things look old and used (see new terminal 3). I am not sure if it is related to the materials they use, to the poor cleaning or just to the mass of people using those facilities...Back to the hotel:Pro:- prefect location: 5 min from Tienanmen and 5 from the main shopping areas- 3 min from the subway stop- nice building- friendly staffContra:- mould in the tiles corners- poor cleaning (possibly material faults) underneeth the sink- dirty plasic-mat in the shower- no heating, so you need to heat up with the aircon (that blows in your face as it is on the top of the bed)- construction site in front of the hotel (we had our first room changed after waking up at 7)- carpet stained in quite a few places- doors do not close properly in the toilets (4cm gap), so your roommate will share your bowel movementsAs said I have changed 2 rooms, and the cleaning remarks above are valid for both of them. My feeling is that with some better materials (easier to clean/mantain) this hotel could have got 5/5, but I can not close an eye on cleanliness.I have the feeling that"
51,27,"Nov 4 2008 	Super location	It is a really good hotel! Recommended!Pro's are: super location near forbidden city and tianmensquare, ATM available in lobby, friendly staff in lobby, bikes for rent, shower is good, clean rooms.Con's are:expensive breakfast (go to the closest mall and have there your breakfast) and very hard beds (but you can ask the staff for extra blankets so then it is a lot softer)We stayed at Days inn for two times: the first time we had a budget room and the second time a deluxe room. Both rooms were identical in layout, the only difference was the daylight as the budget one was under ground and has little windows."
52,27,"Nov 3 2008	Great Location	Excellent locaton.Helpful staffs.Good for the price.The buffet breakfast is good, lots of fruit. Coffee is very strong. But try to get there early (7 am to 8 am is best time.) or else, you might not get a table. The room we stayed for the first week was on the second floor. In the late afternoon, it got stuffy and hot. We asked the maintenace people to fiix the air conditiont, but they told us that the AC has been shut off on all rooms by the central control. They could not help us.The next week, we took the trian to Xian( please beware and don't ever go on the 2nd class. It was a nightmare; 6 bunk beds stucked a very small room, people in the same room with us were loud and rude. They shined their shoes 1 feet away from your face as if you were not there. One man took off all his clothes except his underware and was walking back and forth. The washroom facility in the train was very scary. (Dirty and smelly and no water. We stayed in Xian for 5 days (very polluted city.) The following week we came back to Beijing and stayed in Days Inn for the rest of our vacation. This time, our room was better, but the price was up .Bty, if you visiting Beijing, please make sure that you have tissue or toilet paper with you all the time. Most washrooms in restaurants provide no toiliet paper ."
53,27,"Oct 29 2008	Excellent Hotel	Great hotel , with very good service , clean rooms - small but very comfortable .The hotel is in the best area , few minutes by walk from Tiannamen and the Forbidden City and the staff is very kind and always is posible to find that at least one of them speack a good English.Service in the desk is good and with a smile .De breackfast is tasteful , with all that's necessary to start the day with a good feeling.I reccomend it for every one , its a great experience with a convenient price ."
54,27,"Oct 25 2008 	Not a usual Days Inn	Believe me I have been staying in many Days Inn all around California and this is the best ever. Not the usual Days Inn quality but just like a 4 star hotel.The hotel is as is others described on tripadvisor. Very convenient location - 10 mins walk to Wangfujing and Tiananmen; 5 mins walk to MTR station; bus stop right at the corner of the hotel that takes you all the way directly to the Olympic park - just ask the guy at the front desk he will be very happy to help you.We booked through the hotel website for a 2 beds room, which is actually same price for a 1 bed superior room. We already specified that we will be arriving late, only got there after 11pm. Check in was fast and easy, no hassle at all. They gave us a room on the 3rd floor, when we got there we were already tired with all the heavy luggages; when we entered the room, found that there's only 1 bed. So we went back to the loby asking for a 2 beds room (I'm travelling with my mom). They showed us another room on the 1st floor very close to the lobby and said that is the only room for that nite, that is a really small one u can hardly walk after putting all the luggages and it will be very noisy as people are walking back and forth on that corridor. So we went back to the room on 3rd floor and the front desk agree to get us another room the 2nd night. Unlike the reviews here we found the room and the bed really huge!!! plenty of spaces and the most thing that we like about is the *HUGE* bathroom. You can actually put a bed in the bathroom!!! (right we actually think they should make the bathroom smaller and make the room larger!!) See from the picture they even have a large bathtub (can put in 2 persons) which we used daily after long walk everyday in Beijing city and that's just a perfect room for couples! So I guess every room varies, we stayed at #2316 so tell them to get this room if you prefer a larger one. We just love the room so we told them we will just it for the rest of our stay. As for help from front desk, since e knows mandarin so basically we didn't ask them to arrange transportation, but they are nice and friendly. Breakfast is not included for our room but thats fine, we would love to trip local foods around the corner for just $20 rmb for 2 persons rather than the price in the hotel. There's a dumpling restaurant to the north of the hotel which we saw many customers of Days Inn go there for breakfast. Bed is very conformtable unlike other's commented to be hard, we found it and the bedsheet very soft and nice and clean!TV has several channels in English like CNN Bloomberg which I think is enough as you are not there for the TV, but that should be enough to fed you up with world newsHave a business center where you can use the computer for $10rmb for 30 mins, if you have laptops its actually free to go online in the room tho. they provide wireless and cable lan.Slippers are provided but you have to look up in the drawers.There is a really really nice and Chinese style park right next to the hotel. So after a day we always get a walk in the park sit there and relax and you can see many locals relaxing there too.Some held back for this hotel:- One day we tried to ask the front desk guy to arrange taxi for us to go to Dongzhimen; there are 2 taxis always standing by at the hotel (we see them everyday); the hotel staff said we can go and take those taxi. So we went straight to the driver, but they refused to take us (simply becoz the distance is not far away) and told us to take bus and the hotel staff just stood there pretending they know nothing. I guess because we are Chinese they usually will do that to us. If you are foreigners probably will be fine as they will offer you to go some jewelery shopping. But if you don't like that, I suggesst go down to the street, take out your hand and jump into a taxi, they can't refuse if you're already sitting inside the cab!- Since the hotel is right next to some Hutong lived with locals they usually wake up very early - like 5 in the morning, They usually talk loud with neighbors so sometimes its a bit noisy even you don't open the windows- TV is kind of small comparable to the size of the room; but as I said, we dont come here for TV, so its fine- Not enough light in the room, very dim all the time. But that's not a big problem we don't stay there all the timeAll in all it's a nice hotel, we definately will stay there again. But be warned that:- if you need a 2 beds room, call them ahead to make sure you get the one on 3rd floor. - Don't try to stay on 1st floor as it will be very noisy. For this price you can't ask for more."
55,27,"Oct 10 2008	Conveniently located	Convenient location near Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing Street. 5-min walk to Tiananmen East Metro Station. There are bicycles for rent - this is useful as Beijing is monumental in scale.Note that the cheapest web rates are for the basement rooms. They are a little small and dark but if you are out sightseeing the whole day, you'll only need a clean place to sleep. Breakfast is also at included at the cheapest rate, but there are lots of places within walking distance. The ATM machine in the lobby is also useful to have."
56,27,"Oct 7 2008 	Close Proximity to Tian'anmen. Safe area	I stayed at the Days Inn Beijing for 4 days during the Chinese national holiday week. A definite plus point is the close proximity to Tian'anmen Plaza and the Forbidden City. Also, the major shopping street - Wangfujing Street is just a main street away. Centrally located between historic sights and between 2 subway stations makes it easier to commute to other places of interest like Summer Place. To Temple of Heaven there is a direct bus no.60 outside the hotel. At night there would be a guard patrolling the main entrance of the hotel, enhancing safety. For the price paid nightly, it was good value for the location and services offered by the hotel staff. Hotel offered day trips that were of reasonable pricing and bikes could be rented as well. Enjoyed my stay thoroughly!"
57,27,"Sep 25 2008	Made in China...	The location is really good. And the rooms are quiet. The staff is friendly. And you can rent bikes (very small mountain bikes). The room looks nice. But it is made in China ... after 2 years everything is a little bit run down (the shower's door fall down, the carpets are dirty). But the service is good: they fixed the door within minutes ...If you choose the budget rooms like me you should know that the rooms are in the cellar, with only a small window and that they are quiet wet. I am not sure if it is good for your health if you cannot stand mouldy rooms. But in sum it was a nice stay (for not two much money)."
58,27,"Sep 18 2008 	Lovely hotel Great Location	We stayed in the Days Inn hotel in September for 3 nights. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience. The hotel is in a great location, really central and just a few minutes walk to the main sites. The room was really modern with a big bathroom and a great shower - although the bed was quite small and hard. Breakfast wasn't included in our rate. We paid for it one morning but it wasnt really worth the price. There's a shopping centre 5 minutes walk from the hotel with loads of choice for breakfast cafes. A word of warning on the hotel Great Wall tours - they stop at Jade factories (or similar) and are not direct so you may be better doing this independently (we did and was very easy to organise). Staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Internet access was useful."
59,27,"Sep 15 2008 	Perfect for my needs	I booked the hotel through their website. Before I arrived they were very helpful in providing information and a letter of confirmation for my visa. As I was arriving after 6pm I had provided the hotel with my credit card details to secure the booking (nothing deducted from it). On arrival, check in was quick and I was shown to my room which was clean. At check in they took my credit card and took the cost of the room for the 4 nights as well as a deposit. They didn't actually put this through which I discovered at Check out - a little confusing but seemed ok. (5 days later no charges at all have registered on my credit card.)I had booked a deluxe Queen Room. I was on my own so the size of the room didn't matter, but I imagine it would be quite cozy with 2 especially with luggage. The bed was definitely a double size rather than queen. The linen and towels in the bathroom were good quality which I appreciated. The bathroom was pretty clean a few stains in the corners which didn't bother me at all. The shower was great with awesome pressure - something so many hotels in this price range don't have! They provided essentials such as toothbrush, comb, shampoo etc and slippers in the closet . There is also a safe in the closet which I found very useful. The room requires you to put the key in a slot to operate electricity which I think is great as it means lights and air con aren't on when the rooms not in use. The air con was effective but was a little noisy when it first started up. There was a mini bar in the room with drinks and chocolates but as with all minibars it was overpriced in comparison with local prices - but still nice to have access to. The hotel provides free bottled water daily.There is a pleasant courtyard out the front with a nice area to sit. Beware of the mosquitos at night though! One day I actually left my camera out there by accident and when I realized a few hours later one of the maintenance workers had handed it in to reception to my great relief. I really appreciated their honesty.I would advise to avoid the hotel restaurant at all costs! I was really tired one night and ordered a grilled chicken burger there only to get a very fatty fried thing that was almost inedible and very expensive. Also, breakfast wasn't included in my rate and one morning I paid 68Y for breakfast which was ok but very expensive. The food is a mix of western and chinese food.The location is what is the best thing about this hotel - walking distance to so many wonderful sights in Beijing. There is a lovely little park which you can walk through to reach the Forbidden City and in the morning locals were exercising there.Overall I would recommend the hotel, but I would not book through the website as I believe there are better deals to be had through other sites at the last minute.The photos on the hotels website are a true representation of the room I stayed in - although there were no rose petals for me!"
60,27,"Sep 6 2008 	Great Location Great Value	This hotel was in a great spot. Near Forbidden City and a walk to restaurants and shopping. Near a subway stop too which is not a bad way to get around. Stayed in basement room. Very clean, nice basic amenities. My only complaint was that some people were loading bricks on to a truck at 4 in the AM and it was impossible to sleep that night. The staff didnt do anything about it. Maybe they couldn't. They had a decent buffet breakfast but overpriced by Beijing standards. Overall, assuming the contruction nearby is done now I would recomment the place."
61,27,"Aug 13 2008 	Good place to stay for its location - room can be better	This was our first accommodation in a month long travel in China. We booked it direct via the Days Inn website and checked where it is on their map, although it took us a long time to find it as we didn't expect the roads to be so far apart in China (everything in China is big!). The location was great though as it was a street away from Frobidden City on one side and the Shopping Street (Wangfu Jin?) on the other side. Both around 5 mins walk. We stayed at the lower priced room which is on the basement level of a separate building so if you want light, you might want to pay a bit extra. There were construction noises every morning as they seemed to be just digging the front area of building for no reason - but apart from that, the hotel is located off the main road so it is quiet-ish. The room was ok with aircon - our first room air con broke and they changed us into another room after the DIY man couldn't fix it. The bathroom is separated by sliding door so not much privacy but the interior was nice.Staff at reception couldn't speak much English but that seems to be the norm every where in China still.Had dinner 1 night in their restaurant - nothing to rave on about.Overall, it was good price for the location as it right next door to the main attractions in Beijing and subway was close by."
62,27,"Aug 12 2008 	Top European quality	We stayed a week in this hotel and were very surprised about the design, equipment and cleanness of it. It would be a great choice in any major European cities - not to talk about the outstanding quality it represented in this geographical context. It is located perfectly in the center, still very quite."
63,27,"Jul 24 2008 	Loved it	I spent five nights here in May 2008 and was very impressed - quite possibly the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, and for the cheapest I've ever paid too. We booked through hotelclub.net as it was the only site we could find with availability for this particular hotel for the dates we wanted. In the small print it said if we checked in late, the room wouldn't be held for us. Realising we'd be checking in some time around midnight we tried to sort this out with hotelclub who basically didn't care and told us to contact the hotel ourselves directly, which, in hindsight, given the level of english spoken by the hotel staff, probably would've caused more problems.Anyhow we turned up at about midnight and checked in without any problems - the reception staff were all very friendly and helpful. As we were expecting our onward train tickets to be delivered sometime during our stay, they were very helpful taking messages for us from the train company and then holding the tickets for us at reception when they did finally turn up. They only speak very basic english but compared with everyone else in Beijing they're practically fluent.The room was of a good size, very clean and to a high standard - quite boutiquey like other people have said. Very nice bathroom with gorgeous walk in shower and a whole range of complimentary toiletries from soaps, toothbrushes and intrigueingly named &quot;ladies bag&quot;. They also provide slippers - they're in the drawers in the wardrobe which was tucked away behind the bathroom door. If i hadn't read about them on here I never would've thought to look for them. There's a desk with small kettle, coffee and tea and mineral water, and a flat screen tv with plenty of channels.The only mildly annoying things about the room was that the bed (yes, quite hard) was pushed against a wall so if there's two of you, one needs to crawl in from the bottom. Also, this amazingly done room didn't have a window. Not exactly a necessity but it meant we didn't really know what time it was in the morning, or what the weather was doing. Breakfast is an extra 60 RMB and really not worth the price, even if you're like me and have a funny thing for hotel buffet breakfasts. Many chinese dishes, some baked beans (hard and strangely shaped in a watery sauce), breads and pastries, and a man at an omlette station who happily fried me two eggs in lots of oil. We didn't get there til about 9:30am and by that time the place was a mess - food everywhere and a lot of things had run out. The shopping centre just across from the hotel on Wangfujing Street has a basement food court, and there are plenty cheaper breakfast options there - a supermarket, cafes and a starbucks. (hint: if you're leaving early, don't count on the supermarket - it doesn't open til 9:30am despite it being right next to a rush hour subway stop)As others have mentioned, taxi driver's arent familliar with the hotel, but they all know the Beijing Hotel which is around the corner. As the hotel is set in it's own courtyard, you have to walk out onto the street to hail a taxi, although the hotel staff don't mind doing this for you, even in the pouring rain. On the really rainy days they even had umbrellas for you to borrow - for free as well. Also in the reception is a board where they post the times for the flag raising and lowering in Tianamen Square, as well as the weather forecast for the next day. Great location too, about a 10 min walk from Tianamen Square, Wangfujing Street and the nearest subway stop. Would definitely recommend."
64,27,"Jul 20 2008 	Great deal	After a business trip Beijing, I wanted to stay a few more days to do some sight seeing, but couldn't afford the business hotel rates. This hotel was a terrific bargain! It's not luxurious, but the location and price are right!I decided on one of the cheapest rooms on the basement level. I had read ahead of time that these only had the tiny basement window, so I wasn't surprised by it. If I hadn't known that ahead of time, I probably would have been upset. I went with the lower rates so I could spend more money on touring. The sheets were clean and new (I'm picky about that) and the towels were clean. The carpet had some stains, but slippers are provided. The bathroom was very clean, but needed some new caulking to make it look cleaner.The staff speaks good and is very service oriented. They very helpful and friendly.The internet is cheap to use (10 RMB for 30 minutes) and the tvs in the room are quite nice. Lots of channels are available.The location is the real reason I booked this hotel. It is walking distance to the Forbidden City and big shopping streets as well as lots of restaurants. I was so happy I made the choice to stay here.I booked a Hutong tour through the front desk. A taxi picked me up and brought me to the Drum Tour. A guide then accompanied me on a pedicab tour of the Hutong and we stopped at two homes. I was happier doing that tour through the desk rather than negotiate that on my own. For other tours, I booked a personal tour guide so I could go on my own pace."
65,27,"Jul 18 2008 	I would pay more for this hotel!	I loved this hotel. It's 3 min walk to Forbidden city and 5 min walk to the main shopping street.The room was spacious and very modern and clean. Staff was friendly and helpfull.The hotel is not big, boutique. Hightly recommend it to everyone.You can book directly, remember to negotiate the price!"
66,27,"Jul 15 2008 	Great choice!	My experience with the Days Inn Forbidden City was excellent. I stayed there while on a trip in February, and highly recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel with decent amenities in a great location. I arrived late at night after a delayed flight, but the cab driver did not have any problem at all finding the hotel, and I did not have any problems checking in. Do be sure to print out the address in Chinese characters before leaving, as most cab drivers do not speak English. You can copy and paste it from the Chinese version of the website. Many of the hotel staff also did not speak much English, but there was always one person at the front desk who was proficient, so it was never really a problem for me. This hotel is far from luxurious, but was clean, comfortable, had free high-speed internet, and is in a fabulous location -- walking distance to most major tourist attractions. The staff are also very helpful -- they called a cab to come take me back to the airport when I was leaving, and helped me with daily itineraries and booking a trip to the Great Wall. My only complaints are as follows:1. The hotel seemed to be under construction while I was there, which caused a lot of noise, dust, etc. Not a huge deal but kind of annoying.2. I booked a trip to the Great Wall through them, and decided on the cheapest option -- a small group tour which was about $25 for the full day and included lunch. They told me it would not include the tourist trap diversions my guide book warned me about , side trips to a jade factory and a &quot;traditional Chinese medicine&quot; demonstration -- scams, essentially. But, it did. This was frustrating as it detracted from the experience of the Great Wall, and if I had known we would be taken to these places, I would have chosen a different option. I wish that the Days Inn worked with a more legitimate tour agency. But that is my only major complaint and would still recommend that people stay here -- just not use them when booking tours!"
67,27,"Jun 24 2008 	Fantastic!	I cannot imagine a better hotel for the money in Beijing. First off, if you're from the States, don't think of this as a typical Days Inn. It's much more like a stylish boutique hotel. PRICE - Excellent. It's not a five star hotel, but you're also not paying 5-star (or even 4-star) prices. Great deal for the money.LOCATION - Perfect! Right smack in the middle of everything, on a quiet street, right next to a nice hutong. Walking distance to the Forbidden City, night food market and shopping street. Arguably a better location than the expensive 5-stars.ROOM - Small, but it's Asia. There were some slight stains on the carpet, but I wasn't rolling around on it. The bed is hard, but I haven't found a bed in China that's not. Modern amenities.BREAKFAST BUFFET - Excellent.SERVICE - Here's where this hotel skyrockets in quality. The service was absolutely fantastic. Almost everybody at the front desk can speak English fairly well. Everybody is very nice and well-trained in hospitality. They also go above and beyond the standard services. Here's a perfect example of how great the service in this hotel is: Moments before I left for my trip to China, my laptop unexpectedly crashed and went into a coma (thank you, Microsoft Vista). Since I was on business, it was crucial that I brought my laptop, and I needed to get it up and running. The IT Manager, and Ricky (the assistant manager) spent hours of their time helping me, and ultimately helped to solve the problem. When was the last time you heard of a Days Inn even having an IT Manager?Excellent experience, and the only hotel I will stay at in Beijing."
68,27,"Jun 21 2008 	Good price/quality/location ratio	I stayed there over a week in May 2008. Great location, just a few minutes walk to the Tiananman Square or to the famous shopping area - Wangfunjing Street in oposite direction. It is located next to the Forbidden City side gates. Wanderful park paths just for nice walk directly to the Forbidden City main entrance. The English-speaking stuff is nice and helpful. You can let them organise visits to the most famous places in Beijing and around it. The air conditioned rooms are clean and comfortable with reasonably big bathrooms. You can expect avarege breakfast with some Chinese and Continetal food. Huge advantage of the hotel is free WiFi Internet access!Pros:- Great location- English speaking stuff- free WiFi Internet accessCons:- Breakfast and restaurant food could be better (limited food assortment)"
69,27,"Jun 17 2008 	Good location and nice clean hotel	This hotel is really quite nice and a great value. The rooms are better than I was expecting - not very large, but nicely done. Hotel staff is very friendly, but a bit busy and english is not that strong. Location is fantastic! You can walk to shopping (just to the west one block) and Tianamen Square etc. There is a great little dumpling store - go out to the main street and turn left. It's about 1/2 a block down the road on your left. Teh dumpling menu is all in chinese, but they are great and very cheap - just try your luck or the staff will help translate (sort of). Two things to watch for: 1 - the hotel will arrange tours for you, but they have a very restricted offering and they will not do anything beyond what they offer. For instance, they only go to two places on the great wall they would not arrange a car for the day unless we went to one of those. Later, we wanted to arrange a performance for some arcobatics, but when it became clear that we did not want to go to the their &quot;sponsored&quot; place, the staff person (Gary) refused to help us and became quite rude. So, if you want to do anything outside of their few selected (and more touristy / overrun) attractions, make your own arrangements before hand. 2 - a lot of taxi drivers do not know the location. So, print a map and make sure you know more or less where it is. This may improve over time as the hotel becomes more known. Overall, a great place considering the price and would stay there again anytime."
70,27,"Jun 4 2008 	Perfect Tourist Hotel	This hotel is only a year old at this point, so the only real problem it had was that the cabbies didn't know exactly where it was and they don't normally speak English. They usually get close enough so that you can point to it, though.The rooms are big enough to be comfortable in, but not huge. We did live out of our suitcases because there didn't seem to be enough drawer space. No biggie for us, but you might not like that. It was very clean and our view from the third floor looked down on the hutong and Imperial Archives.The breakfast included with the room includes noodles, rice, fruits, vegetables, breads, cereals and an omlette bar. Sometimes even french toast or pancakes. The coffee was very good.The location is fantastic for the tourist. The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square are just a short 3 or 4 minute walk, and you can get there by walking through the beautifully manicured Imperial Gardens.The staff was very easy to deal with. We booked three tours through them, and once used their very affordable internet service. We had a great time, and I credit this hotel with at least part of our experience."
71,27,"May 29 2008 	hmmm not impressed Budget Hotel	We decided on this hotel due to Price, location, and the ability to go to their web site to make a reservation. I made a note on the reservation that we did have a late flight and our check in would be after 10pm. I used my Credit card to hold the room. Unfortunately they didnt read the notes, 2 rooms with twin beds were NOT reserved when we arrived after 11pm. It was a good thing that our tour package included a guide and van pick up from the airport and our tour guide spoke chinese and discussed things with the front desk. Their english is not as good as I expected. We ended up in the Budget rooms in the basement. Fairly clean, dirty floors were expected, and not so clean tile in bathroom. Rooms were very small. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast, the price was a bit more than what we understood from reviews, no biggie, but when I left the buffet to get my daughter and came back, just to sip coffee while she ate, they charged me again for breakfast... absolutely would not have happened if there was no language barrier. After you argue for 30 minutes, you tend to give up. It was definately BUDGET hotel, but once you get your bearings, the location is very close to Tianamen square/Forbidden city, and in the other direction Wangfujing shopping area."
72,27,"May 27 2008	good hotel - avoid travel office	Overall my stay at this hotel was excellent. good location,staff and rooms. I would suggest though that you avoid the airline ticket office as the woman there had no clue at all and was unable to book a simple Beijing - Hong Kong ticket after two hours. i walked around the corner to the Beijing Hotel where they did it in 5 minutes with no hassle."
73,27,"May 25 2008 	Could not check-out fast enough	Drove down unappealing alley to Hotel which Taxi driver had difficulty finding. Our first room was extremely small leaving little room for our luggage. Although the bed was made, the worn carpeted floor was littered with dirt and the tiled bathroom floor was dirty and slimy. We demanded and were taken to another room which they described as a VIP room. This &quot;VIP&quot; room, although slighlty larger than first room and containing a king bed,, rather than the queen bed in the first room, offered a spectacular view of the rear of local bar or warehouse just a few feet away. In the approximate 10 feet between our window and the adjoining building were stacked crates of beer bottles, both used and unopened. I guess thats what they call local &quot;flavor&quot;. My girlfriend was miserable (so was I) and so that night we took a ride to visit friends who were staying at the nearby Howard Johnson Paragon Hotel. I went to the Front Desk and was offered and shown a wonderful Executive floor room on the top floor which including admission to the executive lounge, full breakfast in the executive lounge or Atrium Restaurant, internet, etc. cost a total of approximately $90 USD per night. The following morning we fled the Days Inn and checked into the Paragon where we had a truly wonderful stay for about the same total price (including breakfast) as we would have paid at the Days Inn. Only advantage of the Days Inn is that it is very clost walk to Forbidden City, but with taxi fares being so incredibly cheap in Beijing and indeed all of China, dont even think about staying at the Days Inn. Moreover, dont rely on Tripadvisor rating, it is unreliable for this hotel"
74,27,"May 15 2008 	Fantastic hotel for English-speakers GREAT location	This is a great choice for a mid-level hotel in Beijing. The rooms are clean (bathrooms are really nice). If you want to explore the city and use your room for showering and sleeping, this is the place. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Not many people speak English in Beijing....there was always at least one fluent English-speaker at the front desk. The rates are reasonable and the location is ideal. VERY close to Forbidden city, Tianamen Square and a subway stop that can take you anywhere in the city! I highly recommend this hotel for your time in Beijing."
75,27,"May 5 2008 	Excellent location and good rates	Highly recommended. Excellent hotel, with good rates and clean, comfortable, rooms. Very central location, near to the Forbidden City. Midway between the Tiananmen Dong and Wangfujing line 1 subway stations. Entrance is just west of Naneyan Dajie, just a short walk north of Dongchang'an Jie."
76,27,"May 4 2008 	Great location good value	Perfect location for sites since it right next to the Forbidden City/Tienanmen Square. There's also a popular shopping street about a block to the east and a night market for food. The pictures don't do the place justice. I had low expectations for the place, and just booked it because of the price. Was pleasantly surprised by the interior and it looks like they've renovated it recently. Staff was helpful arranging tours and shows for us."
77,27,"Apr 26 2008	Great hotel for budget traveller	I must say that with the price, both the location and comfort cannot be beat. This hotel is new, and it looks and feels new, The room is nicely decorated and understated. Fast speed free internet connection, although you might have problem with the WIFI depending on which floor you are on, but you can always connect using the LAN cable provided. This hotel is not as hard to find as I thought it would be. It is just 5 mins walk to everything!!!!!!! This hotel has a nice courtyard too, great to just sit down there and enjoy the tranquility in the midst of the bustling city.Book this hotel you will not regret."
78,27,"Apr 8 2008	NOT BAD AT ALL	We stayed at the Days Inn 5 nights recentley and must say that this hotel is not bad at all. The location is excellent, the staff very helpful and friendly, very good buffet breakfast and the deluxe king room superb.Highly recommend this hotel."
79,27,"Apr 4 2008 	Graet Hotel	We stayed at this hotel just 2 weeks ago and were very pleased. The hotel has a great location, food is excellent (prices are very reasonable) and the rooms are very clean. Also, the hotel staff was very helpfull.They even arranged our train ticket to Xi`an for less than 3 euro commision. I definetly recommend this hotel as a great place to stay while in Beijing."
80,27,"Apr 2 2008 	Not a Bad Hotel	Stayed at Days Inn for 6 days from March 26 through April 1 2008.Our Room was a little on the small side (wev'e had bigger rooms in HK) but it was adequete. The toilet ponged a little sometimes through bad drains, but in general the hotel was okay. I booked this Hotel because of the reviews and its proximity, and have to say that in general it was a good decision. The front desk staff were very helpful, particularly Sabrina, she has a great command of English and was happy to help with any problems or just offer advice. Breakfast buffett was good value, but the waiters and waitresses were not so efficient. The hotel is within walking distance for the Forbidden City, Subway and Wanfujing Street. The Outback Steak House is located inside the Beijing Hotel which is about a five minute walk in the direction of Wanfujing Street for those who need some really good Western food. Yes this Hotel lives up to it's previous reviews, and is good value for those on a budget."
81,27,"Mar 31 2008	More Than Just a Name	Don't let the name fool you, this is unlike any Days Inn you've probably ever seen. We booked this trip with Gate 1 Travel and were very pleased. The hotel is brand new, just opened in October 2007.The rooms have very modern furniture, a flat screen TV, free high speed internet, huge shower, and are very clean. The location is perfect; just a few minute walk to the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Square. There is a huge shopping center just a couple blocks away and several authentic Chinese restaurants literally steps away. We felt totally safe at all hours too.We had a hot American style buffet breakfast every day including an omelet station. What Days Inn back in the States has an omelet station? There was always someone who spoke English on the staff and they were super helpful with any request we had. Honestly, this hotel was nicer than many Hilton's I've stayed in. I would definitely recommend it for just about any visitor. My only gripe is that the bed was pretty hard. It didn't seem to matter too much after a long day of walking to see the sights but as far as softness goes, the bed did bear a similarity to the carpeted floor. Other tips if you choose to stay here:We did the Great Wall tour offered by the hotel. You might want to plan a different one, or just pay a cab to take you. There were two unnecessary stops to see &quot;tours&quot; of &quot;factories&quot; that make jade and pottery. This was nothing more than forced shopping excursions which ultimately limited the time at the Great Wall.Since the hotel is new, most cab drivers don't know where it is. The hotel will give you a card, but that won't help much. Have the staff write the major cross streets for you on the card and cab drivers can find it much easier."
82,27,"Mar 26 2008	Nice place... Nice people	This is a great bargain. Yes, the rooms are a little small and take some hangars with you but it was clean, quiet and comfortable. Save money on travelers checks.. you'll have to go to the bank to cash them and there's an ATM in the hotel lobby that gives you all the Yuang you need at a competitive rate. The tour people at the desk are wonderful.. especially Sabrina! I suggest, however, that you get a cab to and from the hotel.. it should run you around Y100. If you book the hotels car it is Y150.I highly recommend the Li Family Restaurant but make your reservations at least three weeks ahead. It's called Li Jai Cai at 11 Yangang, deshengmen wai hutong, phone [--]. Dinner will run about Y200 ($28 u.s.) or Y300. It is wonderful.Oh, and if you want olympic baseball hats to take home you should be able to get them easily for $1 each or Y70."
83,27,"Mar 25 2008 	Problem Solving Staff In A Bargain Of A Hotel	This hotel had it problems but it is definitely a bargain. The rooms are a little worn and our first room reaked of sewage. The friendly staff moved us to another room as quickly as they could. The front desk is very helpful with almost everything. Beds are more like boxsprings than mattresses but I heard many rooms in Beijing are like this. If you get a taxi chances are they won't know where the hotel is, but just have them drop you off around the corner at the Grand Beijing Hotel. The Forbidden City and Tianeman Square are within easy walking distance and a metro stop is also close. I saw rates as low as $40 a night on some web sites, making this a can't miss deal. The hotel was booked to capacity so book early. This is a solid two and a half star hotel maybe even a three in my book(on a scale of four). This hotel is by no means luxurious or flashy. It's a good decent hotel in a fantastic location. May not be for the finicky or hard to please traveler. My friend was in a deluxe room which was definitley a little nicer than mine. I was extremely pleased with the hotel and bang for buck."
84,27,"Mar 24 2008 	Great little hotel!	Location: excellent- 5 minute walk to the Forbidden City, the major shopping district, and a subway station. Always easy to hail a cab as well, even if the front desk wants to persuade you to 'book a car' through them- don't bother.Room: Being a new hotel, the rooms are in good shape. The beds are typically Chinese- very hard! Free internet was a good thing here, too. We had no issues with hearing other rooms. There's an in-room safe, and the closet is very small. The only complaint is that the hotel smelled of chemicals- like carpet glue or something, which I imagine is because the hotel is so new. Opening the room window was enough to solve this issue, though. It was also nice to get free water in the room and the bathroom products were more than I got at a lot of other hotels in China.Service: We had no issues with service- the English at the front desk is quite good. The same cannot be said of housekeeping, but we always managed to creatively communicate. The desk staff were also helpful in writing our destinations in Chinese for our cab drivers- I would highly reccomend this to anyone traveling by cab. It was nearly impossible to instruct the drivers otherwise.I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel. I also booked through the Days Inn site and managed to get a really good rate online."
85,27,"Mar 23 2008 	Best Choice for Beijing	There are several options for Beijing hotels - a giant Marriott etc, a Chinese hotel, a hutong courtyard-style place.We loved the idea of a hutong hotel, but worried about picking a bad one (the ones widely recommended seem to be permanently booked). Big hotels don't appeal to us and are too expensive if well-located.We settled on the Days Inn Forbidden City and we can't say enough good things about it. The price was great ($75 for a queen bed - didn't see the cheaper basement rooms, but really, don't do that to yourself) and the location can't be beat. This hotel is literally a 3 minute walk to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City entrance. It is 2 minutes walk to the Line 1 subway (Tiananmen East stop), and a 10 minute walk to the Wangfujing shopping street.Cabbies had no trouble finding it (the hotel will give you a card with directions in Chinese).Rooms were a bit small and had no bar fridge, but had 2-person shower, snazzy vessel sink, flat TVs with CNN (occasionally censored ;)), AC, free coffee and tea and 2 bottles of water a day.The beds were firm in a good way, and the linens immaculate.The hotel feels about 2 years old at most, the desk staff speak english, there is a currency changing machine and internet access in the lobby, the cafe has a great-but-pricey Western breakfast (we love Chinese food, but it's nice to have a familiar breakfast to start the day, no?)They arranged a car to take us to the airport for a decent price too.Book via the main Days Inn website, not hotels.com etc, as there is no savings. Note, though, that the maps on the website and most website like Venere are really wrong. It is north of the main East-west street with the subway line 1 under it (can't remember the name), just off Nanwanzey, to the east of Forbidden City. The maps show it as west, near a small lake, which is wrong. It is just around the corner from Raffles."
86,27,"Mar 15 2008	Location! Location! Location!	We stayed in a deluxe room from 10-15 March. We found the room to be very comfortable (though the bathroom had a smell). The staff were very accomodating- provided us with a powerboard wthat could be used for our DVD player, phone chargers etc; turned off the radiator which was making the room uncomfortably warm; extra towels/hangers ... For the price we paid (428RMB/nite), it was a real steal. There is a fabulous machine in the lobby that converted major currencies into RMB, so you don't worry about not having enough RMB. The rate I got for exchanging USD to RMB was current and very reasonable."
87,27,"Mar 10 2008 	Good Feel	I have stayed in a lot of Days Inn in the States so I felt as it was my first trip to China i would stay somewhere familiar, it turned out to be a good decision I found the Inn to be modern and the rooms clean and tidy , the only small complaint was the bed was a bit on the hard side, also no fridge in the room, mind you with -10 outside placing food etc on the window sill did the job.The restaurant was good and the buffet breakfast had a good variety with bacon , chicken sausages, egg station , toast and muffins etc along with the standard Chinese food , the prices were good $10NZD, also you could buy filled bread rolls and sandwiches for $2.50NZD.Most of the reception staff spoke reasonable english and were happy to assit where ever possible.I had all of my dinners at a small local diner about 2 minutes walk away , it had a lot of locals eating there, the menu had photo,s of the meals and the waitress spoke a little english, had a plate of Pork ribs, plate of pork strips and peppers , bowl of Hot and Sour soup , 4 bottles of beer (500 ml) with a friend cost $14.00 NZD.Even though I had no time for sightseeing , the people I spoke to who were staying there said it was close to most of the major places to visit.All in all a very good visit and I will certainly stay there again."
88,27,"Mar 4 2008 	Comfortable Stay!	This hotel is a very basic hotel, as any Days Inn hotel. It is a very central hotel to visit the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing street and its surroundings. The rooms are very small and almost no closet space. I actually thought there wasn't any till I moved the sliding door. The bed is very comfortable and the sheets are high quality. It serves great as a base hotel to get around the city. There were stores around to pick up some drinks and snacks. I only had the breakfast once at the cafe and didn't think it was worth the money. We got down there a little late, that is why there was not much choices left. The rooms I think need a small refrigerator, I have never stayed at any hotel where there was not one available for use. I had to keeps my drinks outside of my window in order to keep it cold. The front desk spoke english very well and answered any questions that I had. The bathroom are an adequate size in my opinion. I know that some said there are small, but they have a sink, shower and toilet what else do you need. Also, the heating system worked very well. The room stayed very warm. I actually had to close the radiators a couple of times because it would get to warm. This has nothing to do with the hotel, but be aware of the first store that is close to the hotel. The store is the first one that you encounter once you exit the hotel and get the street and make a left. They overcharged us twice for drinks and some snacks til we realized he was overcharging us by a lot. The average prices for any drink should be between 3-5 bucks. I stopped going there and walked across the street to the other store and bought stuff there. This store has their drinks on there window display."
89,27,"Feb 25 2008 	Great little motel	Great little hotel the size of an Aussie motel. Quite clean though the bathrooms seemed a bit worn. Which was weird as the hotel is relatively new. At least one staff member will speak English and as female staying on my own I always felt safe. Small restaurant, make a decent coffee. The breakfasts are basic but filling and offer a mix of traditional chinese foods and western produce, Loved the dumplings. Location wise it is a 10 minute walk to the forbidden city and tianmen sq. It is also only a 10 minute walk to one of the large shopping malls and some still standing hutongs. The hotel provides address cards so there was never a problem catching a cab to and from the hotel unless of course the cab tried to not use the metre. Which by the way is illegal.It is a basic but clean hotel and if that is your expectation you won't be disappointed. The only area it could benefit in is in teaching more of the staff some english particularly as the olympics are just around the corner. And a small fridge in the room wouldn't go astray."
90,27,"Feb 12 2008 	Very enjoyable stay	We have just returned from Beijing where we took ourselves and my mother to see the Great Wall of China. We visited over the Chinese New Year and decided to stay here based on value and its central location.The only negative point to make is in actually finding the hotel - Taxi drivers simply do not know it exists and even with the card given by the hotel difficulties still arise. By way of advice, I would suggest guests take a tourist map so they can clearly direct the driver.Aside from this, our stay was excellent. The rooms were faultless, warm and welcoming with temperatures reaching -10 degrees Celsius outside. Breakfast was perfectly good with a choice of eggs and a buffet of fruit and bacon, dim sum etc. The hotel bar was one of the cheapest places for a beer that we could find and the service always friendly although no real ambience. The staff were very helpful to the point that they even stood out in the cold to hail us a taxi on two occasions and even walked to the supermarket to fetch us a few beers when we arrived at 1am on New Years morning as it was too late to go out and the hotel bar had closed.Staff always greeted us with a smile and booked us a tour to the great wall which was excellent and recommended, although this may change with the seasons - There was just the three of us and one other in the minibus which was perfect.The front desk did come close to being pushy on a few occasions with tours and cars around town where commission was clearly at stake which is frustrating but not unusual.All in all a great 1st time visit to Beijing made better by a comfortable place to stay in a location that allowed us to see things quickly in the bitter cold before retreating to the warmth of our rooms. If visiting Beijing again, we would stay here without question and would recommend to others."
91,27,"Jan 29 2008	Excellent hotel perfect location	We stayed at Days Inn Forbidden City from 28th December 07 to 4th January 08. The Hotel should be rated better than 3* It's still has a brand new feel, exceptionally clean and provides good service. The breakfast buffet was very good with a good variety of cereals, cakes, fried vegetables, etc. The rooms are cosy, not large with nice and clean bathroom, LCD TV and huge double beds.The staff is very friendly and just can't do enough for you but they still need to get some experience as they all seem new to their jobs. Their language skills need some improvement too.The Hotel is at an exceptionally perfect location. Both Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City are 3-5 minutes walk away so is a busy shopping street with a huge mall with various international restaurants if you get tired of Chinese food.If I returned to Beijing at any time I would definitely book this hotel again."
92,27,"Jan 6 2008	Great hotel and fab location	We really enjoyed our stay in this new hotel in December 2007. Its location is ideal for Tian'anmen Sq and the Forbidden City- possibly the closest hotel and a short walk from shopping zone and metro and taxi ride from pearl market,west train station and summer palace and was probably the best value hotel during our trip.Our room was bright,modern, simple, elegant and spotless with the most comfortable bed and best shower (separate cubicle and powerful shower unlike other hotels) we had during our tour. It was also quiet as the hotel is set around a courtyard set back from the street. The staff (especially Ricky Gao) were unfailingly polite, pleasant and helpful despite being very busy at times. They will arrange tours and trips but to save money I used lonely planet and they were very obliging in helping me to organise this by telephoning taxis,theatres etc and translating. They also suggested to us that other guests/fellow budget travellers were planning a trip to jinshanling so we might save more money in a people carrier taxi so we had great company, fun and an affordable trip to the more distant section of the Great Wall.The breakfast and room service are charged separately-annoying but this is the norm in China and the breakfast was very good. The hotel restaurant is good but so too is the independent restaurant across the courtyard. It doesn't have the menu in english (yet) but dont be put off I picked by pointing at pics and the food was delicious -way better than the well known and much more expensive restaurants nearby."
93,27,"Dec 20 2007 	Value for money	The room is adequately small and clean. The heater in the room is warm and comfortable in the cold weather, even the bathroom felt warm as there was a heater in the bathroom too. The deluxe room view on the 3rd floor was beautiful especially when it snowed on one of the mornings. The location of the hotel is extremely convenient - walking distance to the major attractions in the city. The room service of the hotel is quite efficient, as we had called up to request for adaptors for our handphone charges.We are very satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back to this hotel is we visit Beijing again."
94,27,"Dec 16 2007 	A Nice Small Hotel	Stayed 4 nights in this newly opened hotel.The street name on the map from the hotel website is not correct. Most cab drivers dont know how to go to this place. Must tell the drivers that the hotel is at the back of BeijingHotel. Then look for the small yellow sign. Location of the hotelis good. 10 minutes walk to Grand Hyatt where there is a elegant shopping mall including supermarket &quot;Ole&quot;.Since the main entrance is inside an alley, need to walk to themain street to catch a cab (the walk is less than 1 minute). Or youmay ask hotel staffs to get you a cab.Front desk staffs speak good English and very freindly andhelpful.Room has basically everything except there is no mini fridge.Buffet breakfast does not have a lot of variety but it is OK for afew days stay. Like mist hotels in the big cities in China, two bottles of water provided each day free of charge.Will return to this hotel unless they are not doing the rapair andmaintenance work properly"
95,27,"Dec 5 2007 	Fantastic Cosy Little Hotel	We searched nearly all the hotels in DongCheng before deciding on Days Inn Forbidden City. The hotel is actually on the East side of Forbidden City rather than west side which is exactly what we want. Most locals are not aware that there is this new hotel just next to Forbidden city. It is literally 5 minutes walk to the main entrance of Forbidden city and 5 minutes walk to Wanfujian Street. The hotel staff are really friendly and helpful. Let's assure that they know all the places in Beijing. If you let them know that you really want to try out what locals eat or where they normally go for shopping, they will have more suggestions for you. This is exactly what we are looking for within our budget and get a good feel of what seiheyuan is all about. Mind you, this place have lots of history to offer. We also wanted a cosy, nice, little hotel rather than the international ones, which are too classy and overrated. For the price of US$54, you get very good deluxe room with a good view on the courtyard. Check out [--] or [--] for fantastic offer. also, check on periodic basis and you will fine nice surprises on the rate. The rooms are very well equiped and spacious for 3 star hotel. The bed feel hard, but you just need that after one whole day of walking. The toilets in each room are equiped with the necessities such as shower cap, toothbrush, shampoo, body lotion and the towels are really clean. The hotel lobby also have an ATM machine that allow you to change your foreign currencies although they only accept USD, Euro and Japan currency. So, keep some USD or Euro in case you need it urgently and it works 24 hours instead of you brining your passport out to the bank to change. If you did not book a taxi in advance for a night ride to airport, not to worry. Just get help from the hotel staff who are willing to stand by the roadside to flag a taxi for you even through it is below 0 degree and windy. If you are looking for a cosy and affordable hotel that is close to all the places that you want to visit in Beijing, Days Inn is definitely the best choice. The subway is just around the corner.We have a terrific time staying at Days Inn!!!"
96,27,"Nov 17 2007 	good room helpful staff	We booked a deluxe room for 5 nights at Days Inn Forbidden City. The staff was very friendly and helpful -- they wrote down directions to various tourist sites, arranged taxi to the airport and made good suggestions for food and shows. The room was very clean and nicely furnished. We asked for a non smoking room and was given a room on the non smoking floor. There was an in room safe, hair dryer and heater/AC. 2 bottles of water were provided every morning. We would definately stay there again."
97,27,"Nov 15 2007 	good location but bad management	The hotel is situated at a very good location. If it's the first time to Beijing, that's an excellent location. Although this hotel claimed under USA company's management, you will realise it's not true. The management style is very chinese and local. This hotel is new but you could see that they are not well managed. The room is small and not very clean. The view of the room is different and most of them are not very good. The breakfast was not good. You can just have a coffee and some bread. For budget travel, this hotel is acceptable."
98,27,"Nov 13 2007 	Good 3 star hotel	First and foremost, this hotel advertise itself as a 3 star hotel, which I think is very correct description. In fact, for this price range, this is as good as gets in Beijing. Location is fantastic. Within walking distance to the Forbidden City, Tiananment Sq, the Wangfujin shopping district, The Exquisite Park, and to 2 subway stations. If you stay at Days Inn, your Beijing sightseeing literally start at your doorstep. Although it is a cheapos, Days Inn share the same neighbourhood with some really fancy hotels such as The Raffles and The Grand Hotel, so that does speaks something about the hotel location. Room is small but nicely done in comtemporary, IKEA-ish style, and the cheapest room is indeed a semi-basement, meaning you only have a tiny window to allow daylight to come in. If this is an issue, upgrade to a higher category (or you can ask nicely to the receptionist - I got my upgrade for free:)Staff speaks good English, with varying degree of course, but nonetheless enough to get things done - Not a profound problem in the likes Hiltons or Sheratons, but a mini-disaster in smaller, Chinese-owned hotel that are usuallu rated similar to the Days Inn.Overall, I had a satisfying stay at Days Inn Forbidden City. In future visit, even if I have a stretched budget, I will definitely stay at this hotel again."
99,27,"Nov 10 2007 	good 	Good - great location, new, clean, modern bathroom, flat screen tv, coffee maker in room, nice linens, friendly manager, close to subway, close to Forbidden City, near nice park, small/ low rise building.Bad - no refrigerator, small room, no kleenex, no ice machine, only 4 hangers in tiny closet, little drawer space, only one chair, some rooms in basement!Standard rooms are good value for a couple of nights. Too uncomfortable for a longer stay."

1,31,"Aug 13 2009	Great hotel	Stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China. Of all the hotels we stayed in this was our favourite. Very elegant hotel with huge rooms. Beds large and very comfortable. There was free internet access in the rooms. The restaurant buffet was excellent and catered for all tastes . It was very good value with dinner for around 8 , breakfast also great with lots of Asian dishes along with the usual bacon eggs etc."
2,31,"Dec 23 2008 	Very nice stay	The hotel stay was very good, breakfast was plentiful and had anything you could desire.Pros: * Hotel facilities * Room size * Breakfast * LocationShortcomings: * Internet access in the room doesn't come cheap and is wired (not wireless)"
3,31,"Aug 19 2008 	Empark - Very Comfortable Amenities	I stayed at the Empark for the entire month of August while I was working at the Olympics. Upon arriving and through the entire stay, the staff was very attentive to my needs. The only issues I have is that the beds are extremely hard, free wireless is only available in the lobby - wired service is available in your room for a reasonable fee (hourly or by day) and laundry (which is done next door) is extremely expensive. Being in China I expected laundry service to be a lot cheaper than western hotels. In the basement of the hotel (floor B2) is a vegas-like mall. Restaurants, small boutiques, spas &amp; a gym/pool that is free for VIP guests of the hotel. I swam a few times at the pool and worked out at the gym. Although the hotel claims the gym is open 24hrs, it isn't staffed round the clock and it often appears closed. The Golden Resources Cafeteria in the hotel is a decent restaurant that offers a buffet for breakfast and dinner. My stay included breakfast and I was never disappointed. They offer a good selection of cereals, juices and fruits, as well as an assortment of hot entrees, breads &amp; sweet rolls. The coffee is good too! Taxis are fairly easy to come by at the hotel but keep in mind the hotel is located in the northwest part of the city and many of the historical attractions and shopping (Pearl &amp; Silk Market) are on the southeast part of town - expect a long cab ride. Fortunately taxi fares are inexpensive here.If you're coming to town for sightseeing, I think you would find this hotel too far out of the way (Summer Palace is the closest attraction)."
4,31,"Aug 26 2007 	Great hotel...problematic communication	I stayed in Empark Grand Hotel for 4 nights (13-18/08), as I was participating in a conference held in the hotel.It was my first time staying in a 5 star hotel, so I was enthusiastic about the room and the hotel as a whole.It was very clean, quite impressive and well decorated. The food in the hotel's restaurant (lunch and breakfast) can be characterized as full. It had vegetarian menus, and seafood amongst others.The only problem I had was the communication part of my staying. The problem was that I was Greek, the reception manager was Chinese and we tryied to communicate in English, so we had to give much more effort than usual.In my lasta night there, I found out that there was a whole city underneath the hotel, but I didn't have time and courage to visit it.As a general, my staying there can be characterized as very pleasant. VagelisAthens, Greece"
5,31,"Jul 18 2005	Perfectly Good Hotel	Stayed here for five nights in the spring. A very comfortable hotel with all the amenities I needed. Helpful staff who speak good English. For about $100 per night US (including breakfast, which was satisfactory but not great), it's a very good deal. I guess there's a whole underground 'city' somewhere on the grounds, but I never got around to it. The rooms are quiet, comfortable, well-appointed, and if you're used to a 3-to-4 star place in the states, it will suit you fine. The beds are HARD AS A ROCK, but I found that to be the case everywhere else I went in China, too. Seems that's just how they do beds over there.The location could be a problem for some. It is in the Northwest of the city, not in a walkable part of town. A taxi to the city center (Tiananmen Square area) takes about 20-30 minutes in (always) bad traffic. But then again, cabs in Beijing are very cheap...It's about a $7 fare. Cabs are readily available at the front of the hotel 24/7. Or just take a taxi to a nearby subway (for half that price) and take the train (for something like 25 cents)."
1,36,Nov 14 2009 	Good value for money in the center of Beijing	This hotel 20 minutes walk of Tienanmen Sq and 5 mins to metro station.100m to shopping mall with cafes and restaurants.Rooms are comfortable with all amenities including high speed internet (80Y per day).
2,36,"Nov 13 2009 	A comfortable place to stay	I stayed at the Mercure Xidan for 5 nights in October 2009. I am an Accor member and at check in I was upgraded to an executive room. The room was good, everything worked, plenty of hot water, quiet, not much of a view but I wasn't in the room for the view.The hotel is ideally located - a 5 min walk to the Xidan subway and the large Xidan shopping complexes. Lots of shops, lots of food, KFC, McDonalds, Subway, the usual and all open till late.I used the subway every day - only 2 yuan to go anywhere! Plenty of self-serve ticket machines in Chinese/English.The 15-20 min walk to Tianamen Square is easy and enjoyable. I used the tour desk to organise a few train tickets for me - all done without fuss.A few of the staff spoke English better than others, but hey - this is China."
3,36,"Nov 5 2009 	Good location nice staff rooms were WARM	I spent a week in the Xidan for a conference (also held in the hotel). Overall, my experience was quite good. The rooms are comfortable if not luxurious. The staff is very attentive, although the level of English varied from excellent to not-so-great. I could barely put out the &quot;please make up my room&quot; hanger before one of the cleaning staff would show up (within 10 minutes). Like many Beijing hotels, they warn you not to drink the water and to use the bottled water they provide. Some of my colleagues drank from the tap with no ill effect, but who knows. The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing, and I recommend renting a bike to get around to some of the nearby sites if you are willing to risk riding in the crazy traffic. My room came with complimentary breakfast buffet, which was really good and included comforting Western staples like eggs, bacon, and Frosted Flakes.I have two small quibbles: #1 It was WARM. Hot in the hotel room, and very hot in the basement conference rooms. The AC system seemed to be turned off. I spent most of the conference in a polo shirt becuase it was at least 80 degrees. My room was at least 78 or 80 degrees at night. I didn't sweat to death, but it was much warmer than I would have wanted -- and it was 60-70 degrees outside! The traffic noise was much too loud to open the window. #2 The internet service is verrrry slowwwwww. Fine for text e-mails but beyond that, prepare to wait and wait and eventually time out. It reminded me of the old days of dial-up access."
4,36,"Oct 31 2009 	Close to many things..	First - a general warning in regards to most Beijing maps - look at the scale. Even the map the hotel provides made it seem like this hotel was a block away from Tianamen Square when it was a good 15-20 minute walk.This hotel was relatively cheap, and I think a good find in Beijing. It was West of Tianamen Square, a nice walk away or 2 subway stops. Two subway lines are within equal distance of the hotel, which is convinient to get almost anywhere in the city.This hotel is also close to the Pacific shopping mall, with many options for restaurants to eat at or places to shop for clothes.The property itself was nice - an elegant lobby with free wireless internet is there for you to use, along with comfortable seating. There was also a lobby bar that seemed popular with Westerners, though we never used it. The business centre provided reasonable prices to use the internet if you didn't have a computer for the free wireles.The front desk staff was friendly, and even included 2 caucasian's if you felt like you weren't communicating well with the local agents.Rooms were comfortable, but perhaps a bit in need of a renovation. I'm not sure how old the hotel or rooms are, but they could have used perhaps some nicer bedding and a bit of a refresh. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was large and spacious. There was also a mini-bar in every room with items are good prices to purchase.With so much to do in the city we didn't spend long in the rooms. They were quiet for sleeping, despite the construction happening next door and we were able to keep it cool from the sun outside.I'd recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Beijing. It's probably not the most unique or memorable hotel, but it suited our needs just fine and with all the surrounding food choice, and close public transit, we were incredibly content with it."
5,36,"Oct 5 2009 	Helpful	The 60th anniversary mandated curfew on this street where the hotel was. At our initiative, the hotel helped to move us away to Novotel Sanyuan without charge and even though our payment was non-refundable.Hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Room clean and tidy. Subway station of Xidan was near enough."
6,36,"Sep 26 2009 	Great Hotel!	I stayed here for 3 nights from 15-18 September 2009, using the MasterCard - Accor Asia Summer Offer 2009 (One free night for every three nights). Average rate each night is CNY378.63 + CNY56.79 taxes.My flight arrived in Beijing at 6.35am and at 6.57am I took a taxi and reached Grand Mercure Hotel Xidan Beijing at 7.42am. Taxi fare is RMB91 plus toll RMB10.Avoid taxi during peak hours (7am-9am) &amp; (5pm-7pm), the traffic is bad.The Hotel staff give us a earlier check-in after 2 1/2 hour wait at the lobby, there is free WIFI at the lobby.The Hotel is located along Xuanwumen Nei Main Street (??????).There are 2 subway stations within walking distance from the Hotel, they are - (Line 1) Xidan(??)station and (Line 2) Xuanwumen(???)station."
7,36,Sep 26 2009 	An ok hotel but nothing special	We stayed at the Mercure as it was part of a BA deal through Trailfinders. It was the best hotel on offer so we thought we'd give it a go.The hotel is fine - there's nothing really wrong with it - but it's just not anything special - especially if you've stayed at the Peninsular and Hilton Beijing Wangfujing.The room was very average - clean and comfortable - and although we were facing out onto the main road it was relatively quite.Breakfast was included in our booking and it edible but not really anything more than that. There were Asian specialities and some Western food but it was limited and the most disappointing thing was that most of the food was actually cold. This was the also the case when we tried the buffet one evening.The staff speak very limited English but were generally quite helpful and they definitely get a plus point for letting us check in at 10.30am after a long flight from London. They also get a plus point for their free internet and for the pool which was very nice.I know roughly what the rack rates are and I get the feeling it's slightly higher than it should be.
8,36,"Sep 24 2009 	When in town stay here.	Earlier this month my wife and I took a short break to Beijing, 4 days 3 nights. During our stay in Beijing we stayed in the Grand Mercure Hotel Xidan Beijing. The hotel is 4* and lived up to its name with a warm atmosphere sumptuous rooms as well as one of the best breakfast choices we have come across in South East Asia.Before travelling we checked out travel reviews on two other hotels we were offered and decided not to tempt providence. The Grand Mercure was well spoken off and certainly lived up to the comments written in a positive way.The hotel is centrally located for shopping and reaching Tiananmen Square etc. We had the use of transport whilst there but the Metro is close at hand also.The hotel has a swimming pool; spa, sauna and fitness centre for use by hotel guests as well as massage services for a nominal fee.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Beijing."
9,36,"Sep 21 2009 	Very nice hotel near the Forbidden City	We stayed here four nights and found it a very nice hotel. The rooms were comfortable, clean and well appointed. The staff was helpful for the most part even though I believe there was often a language barrier. The buffet breakfast was delicious with changing menus each morning and the cocktails in the lobby bar each evening were hearty. The hotel is located a few blocks from Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City which is not the hippest part of Beijing but still a good location. There are 2 Metro stations within 2 blocks and plenty of good Chinese and Western restaurants near the hotel. I recommend venturing into the hutong across from the hotel and eating at the second restaurant on the left. The food is fabulous!We all agreed that we would stay here again if in Beijing."
10,36,"Sep 17 2009	Taxi Trouble	We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of September. The hotel is conveniently situated with hutons and restaurants nearby, Times Square shopping mall next door, 2 subway stations and a short walk to Tiananmen Square. Breakfast was included and supplied a continental breakfast alongside a japanese one. The hotel had a pool and gym with a few CV machines and a multigym in the corner. Rooms were clean and staff were polite. The only trouble we had was getting back to the hotel! A number of times we tried with taxi drivers showing them the location on a map and even giving them the hotel card with the address written in Chinese however they pretended they didn't understand or couldn't read. We were later told by a local tour guide that taxi drivers don't like the location in Xidan because of the busy road and area. By day 2 we gave up and used the subway."
11,36,"Sep 7 2009 	Best 4 stars hotel during our trip	4 stars hotel in China are not like at home, but this was definitely the best we had during our trip around China. Our room was at the top floor, it was quiet but the bathroom needed some improvements.The location is great, you can get a map of central Beijing from the reception and have a nice walk to Tiananmen Square and to the Night market in the evening, quite pleasant.We didn't stay much in the hotel so I cannot comment on the service, but we noticed that the staff at the reception was not really fluent in english, we had difficulties even asking the directions for the subway.Breakfast was GREAT.I would go back again to this hotel if I wanted to stay again in a 4 stars hotel."
12,36,"Aug 31 2009 	Really bad hospitality	I would like to say something nice about this hotel. Because certainly it has some nice features. But bad customer service overshadows even the most praise-worthy amenities. So instead, I'm going to give what may seem like an unbalanced review of my four nights at the Grand Mercure Xidan, by noting what's wrong with this hotel, starting with my run-in with the health club staff. As some reviewers have noted before me, this hotel quizzically requires guests to bring ineffectual &quot;bathing caps&quot; in the pool. Most foreigners don't bring these Chinese accessories on vacation, but staff are more than happy to give you one at the desk...and add the cost to your room tab. I headed down to the pool with my 8-year old nephew on my first day at the hotel, was informed of the &quot;bathing cap rule&quot;, and the kind girl at the desk lent me one of a handful of caps that she said were left over from other guests. I had explained to her that it didn't make sense to buy these caps for a few uses only. Problem solved. The next day at the pool we borrowed caps again. But on the third day, the desk was staffed by a guy who insisted that we buy one. Not only did he insist, but he did so in such a way that would make one question how he ever got a job in the hospitality industry. His behaviour was belittling and disdainful. He claimed I was lying when I told him that for the past few days I had been borrowing one, then he tried ignoring me hoping that I would go away, then he took on a really nasty tone. Not one to take treatment like that lightly (especially when I'm a paying guest), I called the duty manager, who patiently listened to my grievance, but in the end backed up the staff member (claiming that there were no used bathing caps available), and bafflingly offered me a fruit basket for my trouble(?!?!), proposing to examine the &quot;swim cap&quot; policy more thoroughly the next day. In the end, I conceded and bought the bathing cap - it was either that or not use the pool - but I was left with a very sour impression of the hotel. Every time my nephew and I used the pool after that, the desk guy glowered at us and couldn't even be cordial.Even before that encounter, the tendancy toward bad service had already been established at this hotel. On the second day, I asked the concierge how to get to the Temple of Heaven. After some confusion about what I was asking she brushed me off toward the bell boy who spoke virtually no English and directed me north instead of south. When I challenged him on it, he went and got someone else who gave me the correct directions to the south. Makes me wonder - if I can't get simple directions in English to one of the top 5 tourist attractions in Beijing, what good is the concierge?!?As for the amenities themselves, one of our first observations was the stench of the lobby washrooms. I can only surmise that it is a permanent problem because it didn't abate the whole four days we were there. Our room was uninspired - it overlooked a weed-infested inner courtyard that looks like it used to be a pool, and a building under construction next door. The tv remote control buttons were sticky and hard to operate. But worst of all was the closet-like bathroom - it was badly in need of some upkeep. The grout between the tiles was worn away, the toilet bowl had permanent stains, and every time I opened the bathroom door there was a bang from overhead (?!?) I chose this hotel based on positive reviews that I read here and because I am a loyalty member of the parent company. Yes there are some good things about this hotel, but I question how any of them matter in the face of such sub-standard treatment of guests. Needless to say, I will never be back and I recommend that you all give it a pass."
13,36,"Aug 24 2009 	Nice Hotel will stay again	Taxi driver had difficulty to locate the hotel, learnt from taxi driver the former name is Marco Polo Hotel. Conveniently located between two subway stations. We stayed in a suite with queen size bed, about 300 square ft. Linens are clean, toothbrush and other shower gel etc. are available. Buffet breakfast included.  When using the swimming pool you need to wear swimming cap. Next to hotel there is a nice Chinese restaurant."
14,36,"Aug 15 2009 	Everything we could have needed or asked for...	We stayed at the Mercure whilst enjoying Beijing on our honeymoon last month. Absolutely and totally impressed with every aspect of the hotel and staff. We were upgraded as soon as they learned we were on our honeymoon, and the rooms were well furnished, spacious enough and welcoming. Oh, and the beds were the comfiest out of everywhere we went in China! I loved that there was a bath and a shower in the room as my feet needed a well deserved soak after every daily adventure. The swimming pool was also an absolute godsend, as were the jacuzzi and sauna rooms - hitting the streets of Beijing for hours and hours was hard work let me tell you! The breakfast was varied also, with both Chinese and Western options available. Compared to the other places we stayed in China, this hotel was a real favourite of ours and we would absolutely stay there again. I can't see how you would be disappointed. The nearest subway is 5 mins walking distance, and if you walk up the road past the hotel there are lots of shopping centres and places to eat, making the location even better. We also managed to get free internet access on the business floor - seems to only be available for free quite late on in the day about 8pm onwards - staff didn't seem mind, although during the day they stated the cost was equivalent of 10p per minute. Internet is scarce in Beijing so grab it while you can folks! Great city, great hotel, great service, great location...what more could you want? We spent ages looking at reviews and are so so glad we decided on this one!"
15,36,"Jul 21 2009 	An Oasis - great location service interior; yet few points of improvement	I stayed at the Grand Mercure Beijing Xidan hotel in July 2009, together with my girlfriend for 2 nights. We choose this hotel because of its location, 4-star rating and the deal we were able to get through a website. The GMBX is indeed located favorably. To the north is subway station Xidan (5 min walk) and to the south is station Xuanwumen (5 min walk). The bus stop is near the mall, about 8 minutes to the north of the hotel. Both stations are part of a different line which was very convenient for us since we wanted to explore the city and its attractions. The Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen is on walking distance (approx 20 min, head north-east), a great walk in the evening when the temperature has cooled down a bit. When you're up for it, you could walk from Wangfujing to the hotel, via the Tiananmen (about 30 min in total) Furthermore, since Xidan is a well developed area, you will find some business, parks and luxury stores near the hotel. A grand shopping mall is just north of Xidan station (approx 10 min walk from the hotel). Also you will find a Starbucks in the food court / luxury clothing mall in the building just outside the hotel. Finally, next to the hotel is a post office which also sells postcards. From the first sight of the hotel, we noticed that it handles French hotel standards, which is a good thing. The hotel itself can be called beautiful, at least from the inside. The lobby is amazing with fine pottery and glasswork, as well as a big aquarium and a big lounge with bar. From the outside the hotel looks ok, but by far not as neat as the inside. Since we arrived early, the staff offered us free drinks in the lounge so we had a chance to experience the comfort as well as the service. Holding our bags for a few hours was not a problem at all which gave us the oppertunity to explore the city. Staff spoke English very well, yet if you need to talk to someone about more complicated issues, ask for the manager (he is French). Anyway, the room we had had a double bed, desk tv, airco, minibar etc. All the things you are used to from 3/4 star hotel are there, including tooth brushes, shower gel, shampoo, towels, bath robes etc. The room was spacious, something we did not expect, and we even had a lounge chair with foot rest. We found the room clean and with two complimentary (daily) bottles of water, the start of our stay was relaxed. What we didnt like however was the bathroom. The shower seems to be somewhat dated, as well as the toilet which almost fell apart. We expected something more for a 4-star hotel so if there is something the GMBX could improve, its defintily the bathroom. Yet, we did not mind it that much since it was still clean and all. The view from our big window was not impressive since we could see the inner rooftop of the hotel. This seemed to be a former swimming pool or terrace. Now weed is growing all over it. This is perhaps the poorest part and most disappointing of the hotel in terms of interior and exterior. Coming back to our hotel after a busy day, felt like returning at an oasis. Refreshing yourself with a beverage and washing away the filth of the streets in our room. Also, our nights were very quiet and comfortable. Unfortunately I did not have the time to explore the indoor swimming pool and fitness center, but according to reviews on this website, they are very nice.As mentioned before, the service is that of a 4-star hotel. Bell desk is quick and fast, reception booked a table for us at a famous Chinese restaurant and even provided us direction for the taxi driver (not that we didnt take one, but its nice to have it).Probably another thing we liked was the breakfast. Its a Sino-European breakfast: you can find rice and noodles, dumplings and some dim sum here, combined with eggs (scrambled, benedict, cooked), sausages (hot/cold), cheese, fruit, juices, excellent coffee, various types of bread etc. Breakfast was seriously a great start of the day, something you really need when exploring this city.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the GMBX, dispite the few flaws."
16,36,"Jun 14 2009 	Very good hotel convenient location	The hotel is very well placed, close to the commercial area of Xidan in the heart of Beijing. A couple of subway stations were within about 200 m, the National Center for Performing Arts (the &quot;Drop&quot;) was within walking distance, and Tian An Men square could be reached by a 10 min walk. The room was ok, and the breakfast was quite good (good thing for a Westerner not particularly fond of chinese kitchen...)."
17,36,"May 29 2009 	Good 4-Star Choice	I stayed at the Grand Mercure as a result of the reviews on Tripadvisor.com. Overall I think this is a good choice for a 4-star hotel, but on the other hand it's nothing to rave about. I would consider staying here again if the price is right, but would easily consider other options as well. First of all, ignore the guy who said the rooms are better than many 5-star hotels. That is simply not true. The Grand Mercure's rooms are spacious and clean, but they are definitely of 4-star quality. My carpet was tolerable but could use a good cleaning. My bathroom sink had unsightly cracks and the toilet bowl wasn't exactly bleach white. The service was very friendly, but I also experienced some sub-par experiences such as: 1) It took them nearly 20 minutes to bring an iron and iron board 2) They forgot to replace my towels on one of the days 3) The cleaning lady insistently knocked on my door even when my &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign was hung out (but she was very apologetic and friendly when that was pointed out to her).But like I said, for the price I paid (~RMB500 in May 2009) this hotel was a solid choice. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean enough for a 4-star hotel, and the location is excellent."
18,36,"May 28 2009 	Great Service	The Location:The location is just right. To the right of the hotel is a church. To the left would be different malls. Although its a 10-20 minute walk. It is also near Tian'anmen SquareUpon entering the placeYou are greeted with a posh lobby. The bell boys are helpful and very kind. The staff at the front desk can speak english a little better than the normal Chinese people. The lobby also has the feature of being a wifi place. And since you're a guest here, you are able to get those USD changed into yuan. (but can only changed it back in the airport)Security:The elevators needs key cards to be accessed and be used to go to the rooms.(although this is a good thing, a lot of us had a hard time in using our key cards)Each room has a security box. The rooms:are key card accessed and are nicely done. Has a cable tv. Even has an ethernet cable for your laptop. the beddings are smooth and clean. the pillows are really soft and are enjoyable when you sleep in them. The problem would be the washroom. The room that was given to us had some black spots on the floor which i believe can't be removed easily. The pool the pool is found on basement 3. the pool itself is just a small pool maybe around 20 meters by 10 meters. There is also a hot jacuzzi there. (when i say hot it is scorching hot) A sauna is also found in the locker shower area. You would need to buy or have a hair cover/cap. (20 yuan for one overpriced if you ask me)The Fitness centerwasnt able to get in here but as far as i can see the equipments were up to date. Foodthe place has 3 places where you could dine. The lobby has a &quot;bar&quot; place where you could have drinks and even do a little internetthe 2nd floor has the V9 resto that serves buffet type food.(sad part about this is that it seems that their food is never changing) I have eaten breakfast here for 3-4 mornings and believe me, eating the same stuff definitely makes me puke at times. The 3rd floor has a chinese resto. Wasnt able to eat there but would be a nice experience i believeMy take:has nice location, service is superb, good place for a 4star hotel, would go back here but if i had more budget would definitely go to the newly refurbished marco polo hotel near the bird's nest."
19,36,"May 11 2009 	One of the most unforgettable trips I have ever had	I stayed in the Grand Mercure Hotel for about 3days,during which time I feel it is really a good place to live.First, the service lady is kind and honest.I left my car key in the wash room when I went out for a walk after a bath. The time I went back ,I saw the key was just lying on my dest, dry and clean...Second the decoration in the room is extravagant and comfortable.I have been to many hotels around China including Shangrila Hillton etc..I can say rooms in Grand Mercure are as good and even better than many of 5 star hotels.Third ths location, which I think is the most important thing, my wife is shopaholic, this time maybe the most satified time for her, course Xinan is ont of the most famous shopping center in Beijing ,and even in China."
20,36,"May 4 2009 	Lovely Mercure	My husband and I have spent a long weekend in Beijing. We picked this hotel after reading the tripadvisor reviews. We are very impressed with excellent service of this very well located hotel. The hotel is clean and cosy. The staffs are ever so courteous, efficient and friendly. They always make you feel being welcomed. It is very refreshing to find a hotel which is both good in &quot;hardware&quot; as well as &quot;software&quot;, so to speak.We are happy that we've got our money's worth. We'll go back to this hotel in Beijing any time in the future. Again, we want to thank the previous reviewers of this hotel for their recommendations."
21,36,"Apr 27 2009	nice and comfortable hotel	The hotel is not big but well maintained. staffs were very helpful...hotel's in a very good location, can reach line 1 and 2 withing walking distance.Their dosm is very nice &amp; polite. i'll highly recommend this hotel to my friends."
22,36,"Apr 20 2009 	Great Hotel with Fantastic Service	The hotel location is very important to me because my trip always be about a week stay but only 2 days business, so I need to find a fabulous venue for me to take a break from the hard working every day when I was in the company.From my point of view, every hotel have something in common, whether the hard ware or the food, but the most important is the service, the waiter need to bring to you what you want as they want to assist you from the deep button of their heart but not just a job they need to do. This hotel can bring me what I really need as I become a really guest from their family."
23,36,"Apr 16 2009 	Very good value and location	I stayed here for 2 nights last week, and I would certainly recommend the hotel.The property is well-maintained, and the staff are extremely helpful. The restaurant serves plain, but reasonable, food.I especially like the location. You can walk to Tienanmen Sq/Forbidden City in 10-15 minutes, and the walk is along a pleasant hutong. The hotel is also just a few steps away from the subway, though I didn't use it."
24,36,"Apr 14 2009 	The hotel provides Value for Money and atmosphere of Biz	Read of the comments from Tripadvisor and stayed for 3 nights. Good location as it is conveniently located both Financial Street and Beijing CBD. Not only biz purpose but also there are many tourist attractions closeby as such Tianan'men Square/Forbidden City/Antique Market(Liulichang)/Qianmen street etc...Those who would like to use a public transportation can easily access to line number 1 or 2 within 3 min on foot.The hotel room is spacious and cosy. wi-fi as comp basis in the public area that is great value for money those who have biz purpose. the breakfast is sumptuous choices and lobby bar has happy hour on a daily basis where the ambiance provides a perfect veune for biz talk with background live piano music.Those who would like to try chinese cuisine. no need to seek for other restaurant as the hotel has mouth watering cantonese food available for all day long on level 3.In general, the service of staff and the quality of english they offered me exactly meet what I need for my trip in both biz and leisure.To sum up, I will definitely come back for next stay as it gives me of feeling home where I don't belong to."
25,36,"Apr 13 2009 	A lovely good value hotel in great location	This lovely hotel has a great location in walking distance from the Forbidden City,Tiananmen Square and 2 subway lines. The rooms are modern, clean and well maintained. There is a nice and cheery breakfast restaurant - western and chinese options. The reception staff are friendly and helpful although some have limited English. There is a lovely foyer and the 4 star rating is appropriate. We got a very good price from the hotel's website. There are some excellent, authentic and very cheap restaurants in the area so don't be afraid to try them even though they look rather basic - walk towards the centre of the city block."
26,36,"Mar 26 2009 	Verty pleasant stay and would recommend to friends	Stay at this hotel for 3 nights in March, great location not far from all attractions. Staff were helpful and freindly. Will return to same in the future."
27,36,"Mar 25 2009 	Comfortable Hotel	I like the atmosphere of this hotel. It makes me feel comfortable. And its location is very convenient. The decoration of the lobby is very beautiful and fashionable. Room is clean and large. I like its breakfast which is plentiful and delicious. In a word, good experience of this hotel."
28,36,"Mar 18 2009 	Super Located Hotel	I just finished a leisure trip in Beijing with some of my out-of -Beijing friends and they stayed in Grand Mercure Xidan. The hotel located in Xidan area, which is the center of the city. We walked to the Forbidden City and Tian'an Men Square! And it's really easy for us girls to go shopping at Xidan Shopping areas, also walking distance. We enjoyed one buffet dinner in their V9 western restaurant. They have a promotion which is 50% discount for their buffet dinner, so it's really valuable. And the waitress in their restaurant smiles sweet. At last, my friends go to the airport by shuttle bus at Xidan. It's really convenient for both leisure and business!"
29,36,"Mar 12 2009 	Super Valuable Hotel	This is a super valuable hotel in city of Beijing close to 2 lines subway stations which location close to Tian'an'men Square, National Grand Theatre, Financial Street and Shopping areas. There have a capacious lobby and fashion restaurant on the 2nd floor. The biggest room more than 30 sqm I had stayed. I will be come back next time."
30,36,Mar 12 2009 	The most outstanding 4-star hotel that I've ever been in Beijing!	The location is perfect in downtown! The service here is very warm and professional! I hope to stay here once again.
31,36,"Mar 7 2009 	Good!!!	The lobby is very beautiful,convenience traffic,passional and circumspect service, It is my first choosing for my travel to Beijing!"
32,36,"Mar 4 2009 	cutie sweet hotel	My last stay here was 2 years ago, now it has been managed by accor group.  Hotel is not so big and the lobby is sooooo charming, decorated with red fish in aquarium. Staffs are well trained &amp; with good manner, really helpful. The V9 cafeteria's quite sweetie, strongly recommend lovers to go there, cutie place for date:P  Good location, 10 mins on foot to shopping center while it's not noisy in the hotel. i will choose here to stay for my next visit in beijing."
33,36,"Feb 27 2009 	comfortable rooms good location	Rooms generally clean and comfortable but the bathroon needs a bit more attention Good location as Xidan shopping area was abt 15 mins away on foot. Breakfast buffet was fine but CHINA'S KITCHEN, their chinese restaurant was the best. they serverd delicous chinese meals( ALA CARTE). The staff were helpful . I am recommending this hotel to my friends and wld return to stay on another day.i also thank the other reviewers as i made my choice for this hotel based partly on their reviews and with the recommendation of my travel agent.MARY LIM"
34,36,"Dec 30 2008 	Truly lovely	Bueatiful grounds, great rooms, extremely comfortable beds, room cleaned twice a day, staff nice polite. Price pretty good for the service and quality of the hotel. Worth every penny in all respects. Good location."
35,36,"Dec 24 2008	Good hotel clean efficient with tasty breakfasts	Super central hotel, staff pleasant but dont interact well outside 'programmed' situations. That said there were zero problems apart with getting a receipt for a prepaid room!! Rooms lovely and clean, super choice of breakfast. Lovely piano playing in the lobby every eveniing!!! Good choice of mid range hotel!"
36,36,"Nov 20 2008	Wonderful	We enjoyed our stay and found the hotel very clean and comfortable. The breakfast's were amazing, very good and with loads to choose from. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of and they were always on hand to help us out with directions, a taxi, subway or whatever we needed. On return from a day out of shopping or sightseeing our rooms were always spotless with fresh towels and the covers on the bed turned down. Would have no hesitation to stay there again. Thank you Mercure!"
37,36,"Oct 26 2008 	Disappointing	I see from another review that this hotel has apparently been renovated. Really? I'd have hated to see it before the work!It's an okay hotel, obviously quite classy when first built but now very tired and dull, everything's brown or beige and dark. The staff hardly speak any English at all which for a hotel advertising itself as ideal for business people and tourists seems a bit odd. The cleaning of the rooms was half hearted and hardly thorough - in and out in minutes, barely enough time to make the bed. And the decor is very tired and tatty in places.That said, it's ideally located for exploring Beijing and the food isn't bad."
38,36,Jun 8 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	We stayed here last July and the standard of service and hotel are both excellent. We were upgraded to a suite and the room was excellent. The lobby was welcoming as were the staff and there is a nice bar behind reception. The hotel is very clean with beds made up etc every day. The bellboys are excellent. Just tell them where you want to go and they will write it down in Mandarin for you so you can give it to the taxi driver.It is fairly close to the centre with about a 20 or 30 minute walk to Tiananmen Square (taxis are cheap though).All in all I cannot recommend it highly enough.
39,36,"Apr 23 2008 	Under Renovation	We have just returned from 6 days at the Grand Mercure Xidan and after reading reviews on trip Advisor were not looking forward to our stay. However despite the renovation work and basic reception area we had a pleasant stay. Overall the staff were most helpful and friendly. The room was clean and fresh towels always on hand. Bedding and the overall appearance suggests that the hotel is in need of upgrade but we felt that the price we paid more than made up for lack of decor. Whilst we were in the hotel they were running special discount on meals and we found the buffet to be excellent value and of a high standard of presentation and quality. We would return to this hotel again once all the renovations are done, as it was so handy for shopping and seeing the sights. Beware of the black taxis at the front of the hotel. We were overcharged double to the airport. Take the metered blue and yellow but make sure your bags are not too big as they cannot get much in their boots.Scottish Travellers from Fife"
40,36,"Apr 22 2008	Good value	This must have been a very nice place when it was first built. Even the standard rooms are spacious, and contain some high end features, such as granite counter tops, bar, hair dryers.The general theme is minimalist cosmopolitan a little art deco-ish.It has however lost a little of it's lustre over the years. The hallways often smelly, and the carpets dirty. a few dents in the walls, peeling paint - that kind of thing. It is in the process of being renovated though, and the new lobby almost finished when we left.The room itself was clean where it counted. The bathrooms and the beds. Clean glasses and complimentary water.The service was excellent - we had our toilet plug (this happens easily in Beijing, be careful) and someone came and fixed it right away. Admin staff were plentiful and helpful - though not always fluent in English, they are patient while you charade your way through.The food was quite good, they have a French chef - and the buffet was a real variety. From lambchops to sushi. Also half price while we were there (about 10.00$ CAD)Catching cabs from the hotel was never a problem (with assistance from the doorman, but getting cabs to take us back to the hotel sometimes was. At first we thought they didn't know the location - but discovered that taxi drivers don't like to take fares the short distances that we often needed to go. Government taxis are incredibly cheap, so a ride from Forbidden city to Xidan (where the Mercure is located) only nets them about 2.50$ CAD. You can offer them a little more and they may take you. Or you can threaten to report them and refer to thier ID tag - as there is a heavy fine for them if they are caught refusing a fare.Also, good to know, some drivers know this hotel by it's previous name &quot;The Marco Polo Hotel&quot;.All in all, I liked the hotel, slept like a log (nice and quiet) liked the location, liked the food, and the price (75.$ for a standard twin). I would certainly stay here again."
41,36,Apr 1 2008 	Great Value for Money	This hotel was categorized as a 3 star hotel by our travel agent but we felt like we're in 4 star. We stayed at their executive room and it was big and clean. The ambiance was relaxing. We had problem with our shower but was immediately fix. Overall the room and their service were great for this type of hotel.The lobby and some parts of the hotel are currently being renovated probably for the Olympics but we had no problem with it. Their buffet dinner was good.Location is great. We are near the subway. You should have no problem going to hooters :).
42,36,"Feb 23 2008 	very poor	stayed at the grand mercure for 4 nights and was extremely dissapointed, Staff unfriendly, building works abound so no lobby to speak of, no bar average breakfast and average room. I felt quite envious when returning from trips and other travellers were dropped off at numerous other swish hotels and then me back to what was at best a travel lodge ie no facilities. Do not stay at this hotel there are 100's of other chouces do not make my mistake!"
43,36,"Dec 15 2007 	Great place for seeing Beijing	We stayed here as part of our honeymoon in June and have been meaning to write a review for some time now!Accomodation:Can't fault the rooms for the price. It was a good size, clean and modern. Bathroom was also good size and overall we were very happy with quality of the roomRestaurants/breakfast:Firstly, the breakfasts were very good. There was a great range of food available and in contrast to our stay at a hotel in Xian it was all fresh and really tasty. Restaurant food was good - a decent range of food on the menu with service being friendly and prompt. ~We had a couple of lovely evening meals and all were great value. Location:The hotel is well located being a 10 minute walk from Forbidden City etc and near to some local shops. Most of our time was spent going on orgainsed trips which pick you up from the hotel itself but generally this seems to be a well located hotel (note no particular views to see though).Overall:This is a really good 4 star hotel. Service, location and accomadation were all very good."
44,36,"Nov 1 2007 	Just OK	Stayed here last week for 3 nights. I agree with another reviewer who rated it &quot;OK.&quot; That's all it was - just OK.Some of the check-in staff do not speak very good English (eg I asked for a safety deposit box and she replied - what kind of breakfast box do you want??????).We had a room on the 8th floor. It was OK - very old and tired; really could use a makeover. Bathroom was OK but old, some of the tiles were marked and cracked. Our room actually looked out onto the street below, so no building work.Breakfast was mediocre at best. Some of the drinking glasses were very dirty. Food looked totally unappetizing so decided not to even try it.On the good side - we ate from the room service menu twice and it was well-priced and the food was good. We tried local and western dishes and everything was good. The biggest problem was actually getting a menu, as there wasn't one in the room - had to go down to reception and beg for one (nobody answered the phone when I tried calling from the room).As others have stated - most taxi drivers know this hotel as the Marco Polo. Even though one needs a taxi to get anywhere from anywhere in Beijing, I found that a lot of taxi drivers refused to take us to the hotel (ie from Silk Street), saying it was too far away. I noticed many other hotels that looked a lot more central and a lot nicer than this one - this has absolutely nothing to recommend it.Having said that - I can't really complain about anything specific. It was just OK. Beds were comfortable, room was large. But I wouldn't stay there again and would rather pick something newer and better located."
45,36,"Oct 14 2007 	It's OK	We used the Grand Mercure as a base for a four night stay in Beijing. This certainly wasnt the worst hotel weve ever stayed in, but certainly not the best. Hotels in Beijing were quite expensive when we booked, so after much research and deliberation we opted for the Grand Mercure, Beijing. As some people have previously mentioned, this used to be called to Marco Polo, so if you are using a taxi from the airport (as we did) it might be worth telling the driver thats where youre going. First impressions werent bad, the bell hops took our luggage from the taxi and we proceeded to check in, however, when we went to our room, there was no bellhop, so we grabbed our bags our self and headed up. The lobby was clean and spacious with a bar at the back, small gift shop, concierge, tour operator and business centre. The room was large, but it was showing signs of wear and tear, however, it was clean. There were many reminders of the hotels previous identity - on the robes, towels, and drink coasters. I found this quite frankly to be a bit shoddy and lazy  these are very easy things to fix. Our room unfortunately overlooked a building site. We had paid for breakfast in the room rate, which by Chinese standards was very expensive. Whilst the breakfast was plentiful and featured a wide range of items, I think wed have been just as happy going Starbucks next door. On two of the four mornings we were questioned about whether we had paid for the breakfast in our rate, make sure your have two copies of your reservation, youll need one at check in, and keep hold of the second one just in case. The hotel has a swimming pool, sauna and steam room  be warned, you need to wear a swimming hat. We didnt find this area of the hotel very pleasant and actually didnt use the facilities.  My biggest disappointment with the hotel was with the tour operator. We booked a tour to see the Ming Tombs and Great Wall of China. DO NOT USE THE HOTELS TOUR COMPANY. We were picked up at the designated time of 7:30am, and didnt return back to the hotel until 7:45pm. We spent about one hour at the Ming Tombs and about one and a half hours at the Great Wall. The rest of the time was spent travelling, at a Jade factory, eating a pitiful lunch and at a silk factory. The tour was extremely expensive by Chinese standards. I would highly recommend you do some research before hand and make your own arrangements to visit these places. We were very disappointed with the tour, it was such a waste of precious time, and every where we went they were trying to sell us stuff. The tour company gets a kickback from the Jade factory and Silk factory, so its in their best interest to take you there. The hotel is conveniently located, you can easily walk to Tiananmen Square and there are plenty of shops around about. The subway is also located near by and is dirt cheap."
46,36,"Aug 24 2007 	4 star hotel with 2 star ambience	We arrived to a room which smelled like staled rice crackers later to find it was the stench of mold. Our first room had black mold all over the shower and air conditioner. After a long night of trying to sleep, we asked to change our room. Our second room was a smoke filled room. One bed gave us some type of flea bites. The breakfast bufet was the least desirable. The staff were all new since the hotel was recently converted from the Marco Polo hotel. Registration took approximately 1 hour. The gift shop consisted of a closet without any postcards. Our tour guide said that this hotel was known as the second best 4 star hotel in Beijing . I think you if you are planning to visit Beijing you should try a 5 star hotel.Unhappy, US"
47,36,"Aug 22 2007 	Mis-represented as New Hotel !	Spent 5 nights at Grand Mercure Xidan earlier this month. While it is in a good location, close to metro stations, this is a largish hotel (around 400 rooms) that doesn't live up to the grand mercure chain reputation and leaves a lot to be desired. During my trip, we stayed at 4 locations - Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and Xian - and this was by far the worst not only in terms of value for money but in every way!I stayed there with my 18y.o. son and we had a magazine promotional deal which said it was a &quot;new&quot; hotel.Well, it might have been new in the 1980s when it was built and known - as it still is to most taxidrivers - as The Marco Polo. But now it is a very tired spot in desperate need of a make-over. The rooms are not sound-proofed to the level we expect today - but in their favour they do have some inter-connecting family rooms, which are often hard to find. Even the bath-towels, mats and robes still bore the insignia of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; so it has evidently been a walk-in-walk-out takeover. The towels are threadbare; the bathmats unravelling. Yes, the bathroom is still serviceable and must have been very smart back in the early 80s as this is the style of fitting there, but overall this is NOT a quality hotel. The carpets are stained, the curtains are well past their use-by date and are no longer &quot;block-out&quot; by any standard, and the TV was one of the old clunkers with very few channels to select from! Lighting was dim and desperate, and we received minimal re-charge of our toiletries even though we were there for 5 full days. The bed linen was adequate, but not new, and the cupboards were de-laminating, though the safe appeared adequate. Our room on the 8th floor overlooked the festering rooftop above the restaurant several floors below, and featured overgrown &quot;garden&quot; and slush. Peering through the Beijing air pollution, we could barely see the opposite side of the large Avenue in front of us; however, this street view will be the better aspect as soon as the building that is currently being erected next door goes up a few more floors. Workmen are on it from crack of dawn, so a room with that view will be noisy as each successive floor is constructed! (They have constructed about 6 floors to date, so plenty more to go up! ) Given the very close proximity to Tianamen Square and major tourist areas, I can see the owners of this hotel have purchased for future position and not for current premises. I'd suggest it will be a future &quot;tear-down&quot; as are many buildings/hutongs in Beijing. There is a reasonably sized &quot;Roman-style&quot; swimming pool in the basement 3 levels below ground, and a spa that could take about 16 people, with a life-guard-cum-attendant who points at the signs (in English) and ensures one never steps out of line, though I woulnd't like to really need his life-saving skills - too close for comfort; one couldn't relax under his gaze. And they make you sign to buy their (too small) swimming caps before you are allowed into the pool! Use of the &quot;business centre&quot; is a joke. One ancient computer works slowly, with a keypad that jumps everywhere, and they overcharge you to use it! Breakfast was included in our promotional deal, and the buffet closes at 9:30a.m. SHARP. We weren't the only ones we saw caught out by this. Not that it is a good buffet; it offers an odd selection, trying to offer &quot;American&quot; style breakfast but not really making it, and very few fresh fruits or yoghurts suited to a light Australian diet. Quite a bit of Japanese-style items served, and a little cheese &amp; crackers, and tired looking muffins &amp; danish pastries. Take your own tea-bags if you want a decent cuppa! And don't expect much by way of service. The staff here are poorly trained and really need to practice their smiles (and uniform washing and wearing!) in time for the Olympics! The adjective &quot;surly&quot; comes to mind! Yet, given the rush to supply desperately needed tourist accommodation in time for next year's anticipated influx, I imagine the Grand Mercure Xidan will continue to get away with charging too much and giving too little. We were never given a map (we bought a very good fold-out laminated one at the foreign bookstore near the enormous shopping centre around the Hyatt Hotel)but only saw one on the last day when we needed to collect tickets from the concierge desk.  I'd chosen this hotel based on its proximity to sights as well as because of the promotion. Be aware that, given that taxis are cheap enough in Beijing and the scale of walking what might appear to be a few blocks is really quite a bit further than one might initially be lulled into thinking is a walkable distance, location of a hotel probably need not be your highest priority when selecting accommodation in Beijing. Because this is inner-city, it has the drawbacks that not many little restaurants are open after 8p.m., and certainly very few after 9:p.m. - we wanted something around then, and ended up with a walkable choice of KFC, McDonalds, Gloria Jeans, or a sushi-train type of place (we were their final customers at just before 10p.m. ) I think it would be as easy to be further out, use the Metro more - they are building new lines at a furious pace, and the trains are good, if very cramped at times (still not as bad as Tokyo) - and in a nicer hotel rather than stay at the Marco Polo/Grand Mercure. I certainly wouldn't choose it if visiting for the Olympics. There are closer, and what appear nicer, accommodations than this to spend my hard-earned dollars in."
48,36,"Jul 16 2007 	Excellent value great hotel	We loved the Marco Polo! We stayed in December and good a real cheap deal (I think it was around 25 per night!). The hotel is modern, the rooms clean and comfy, the staff helpful and friendly. There is a travel desk in the main lobby, which can help you with trips and further travel arrangements (I needed to get a train ticket and they sorted that all out for me). Our room was large, the bathroom clean and medium sized. we even had HBO and a good buffet breakfast was included. It was excellent value for money! The location is good. Beijing has two main subway lines and there is a station for each within 500 meters of the hotel. There is also a large modern shopping centre close by. The Forbidden City is only a few subway stops from the hotel."
49,36,"Jul 3 2007 	Great Value Great Location	The hotel was very nice overall for the price paid. It is in a very good location just minutes by foot to the Xidan shopping area, which is the main shopping district in Beijing, complete with a lot of malls.The decor all over the hotel is very modern and nice. Breakfast was plentiful with a nice variety of western and chinese dishes.The room we stayed in was large, clean and very nice. The room was a bit warm on the first night, though not really uncomfortably hot. I made a call to housekeeping in the morning and they fixed it by the time we got back in the afternoon. It was pleasantly cool afterwards."
50,36,"Jun 14 2007 	o.k. if the right deal	Got a good deal, in combination with the flights from uk so worth while, Make sure you get the address in chinese character and also Marco Polo (as many taxi's still know it as this..)Appears very out of the way on arrival, but it has very good subway connection 2 stops to Tian'amnen, you can walk to this but subway clean safe &amp; very good, and runs late.Lots of modern Malls on doorstep of hotel(best part is there's no Westerns!). Starbucks 2 min walk (hotel coffee really awful). Lots of building around hotel, although off putting at first this is everwhere on run up to 2008.Taxi's easy from front door, all very cheap (hotel has little card to explain popular locations in chinese to taxi drivers).Rooms o.k. - averaqge standard, nice modern bathrooms, room stank of stale smoke (non-smoking room) didn't clear all week.beds very comfortable, tea coffee water in room.Hotel restaruant really bad (got served half a semi-raw chicken), breakfast buffet ok &amp; adequate for most peole (although a large choice)- if you want silver service you'd be staying at a big US chain and paying 4 times the price. Mall next door has basement foodcourt many options for food (chinese/ japanese) and very good quality, clean/modern and cheap (aimed at young professionals). Other guests either chinese or european which makes for quieter environment.Summary: I'd stay again, as Mercure takes over from Marco Polo would imagine steady stream of improvements will be taking place. Hotel has pool and gym, but to be honest why use when so much to see! (appearred clean and modern)"
51,36,"Apr 18 2007 	Under new management	This hotel has now been taken over by Mercure and I am hoping they will make some necessary changes. Overall it was a good enough hotel in a convenient location, but there were some flaws. Our room (at the front) was far too hot and the aircon made no difference. You either opened the window and had lots of traffic noise or had the fan blasting out air that was little different. The carpet had a big wet stain when we checked in which was disconcerting. On the plus side the staff were nice enough and the pool was very good and quiet (swim caps needed). Breakfast was fairly good, if crowded. The restaurant seemed quite pricey for what it offered and the so-called &quot;happy hour&quot; did not include most drinks. We found a good local restaurant over the road and the nearby Times Square was full of designer shops with a good pizza restaurant if you wanted a change from Chinese. We walked to Tianamen Square and an excellent Peking Duck restaurant quite easily, but taxis are only 10 yuen."
52,36,Jan 28 2007 	A romantic winter	Enjoyed our free upgrade from superior room to suite when we check-in on Dec 23. A very romantic surprise for us! Staff at restaurant were friendly. Spent christmas there and enjoyed the terrific location i.e. shopping at xidan (walking distance under 10 mins) and nice restaurants like the famous korean BBQ nearby.
53,36,"Jan 20 2007 	Great time	Thought this Hotel was lovely. We stayed there quite some time ago on our Honeymoon - at that time it all looked brand spanking new.Room was clean, staff very helpful, breakfast vast, every type you could ever want, Chinese, English, American, European.Thought the location was great, we walked to Tianamen Square and it took about 15 minutes - there is also loads of shops both ways up and down the road just a short walk away.Taxis are so cheap in China that location of a hotel really doesn't matter - the staff in the hotel gave us a card in Chinese to show to taxi drivers where to take us.Excellent stay would go back any time."
54,36,"Oct 28 2006	Nice surprise	After reading other reviews I was apprehensive about the standard of this hotel but was ultimately pleasantly surprised. Location was OK.....we were on a tour so picked up each day by coach. Rooms good, facilites good, breakfast great, restaurant expensive for China so eat out. Can't comment on value for money....part of package."
55,36,"Oct 26 2006 	look elsewhere	When you step into the lobby it looks acceptable but it stops there.The rooms are dated and very worn, the towels were ragged and torn. The sheets and beds were scary. Dirty carpet.The location is in the middle of nowhere, i know that beijing is not central but dear god atleast a little restaurant or bar nearby would be cool. All the previous posts on the concierge are correct - they are of no help.As a bonus - they checked another guest into my room at 630AM in the morning by mistake, a nice Japanese gentleman barged into my room key in hand - needless to say it was the cherry on the sunday.I guess the only positive is that it forced me to stay away from the hotel - so i got to experience a good deal of the city.My advice - look elsewhere, please do it for me."
56,36,"Sep 18 2006 	Hotel was average	My family booked 5 rooms at the hotel early this month for a tour in Beijing and I can say this hotel offers average amenities for a 4star hotel. Everything went okay, rooms were clean as expected, lobby was nice, staff were friendly and breakfast was good... except for the room air-conditioning that doesn't cool all night. I first thought it was only our room that had the problem but when we gathered for breakfast the next day, all our family members complained about their room airconditioning. We called the attention of the front desk and their answer was &quot;since it's start of the autumn season and there's cooler air outside, their hotel decided to shut down the airconditioning&quot;... according to the front desk, we will have to call housekeeping each night if we want the airconditioning turned on in our rooms. It's weird because we know for a fact that hotels shut their airconditioning system only during winter time and not during the end of summer or the start of autumn.Hotel location is average but I personally feel it would be best to be billeted in a hotel along the Wafujing Street especially if one's stay in Beijing is short.Overall stay in Beijing is good. The sights to visit are awesome! A must see on my list would be the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven."
57,36,"Aug 30 2006 	A nice place overalll	I stayed here in January and I find it to be a nice property. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms a good size. It's hard to say if the location was good because everything in Beijing seems so spread out, however it was something like 3-4 blocks from Tiannemen Square. The staff were all friendly and most spoke good english or at least humoured my poor attempts at mandarin. The hotel is a very 'western' style hotel and seemed to cater to that market. Further down the road there was a very large shopping precinct with supermarkets, department stores and fast food outlets. The chinese love their fast food outlets and are great if you don't speak the language as you can point at the pictures to order. The only negative I had with this hotel was that you had to buy a swimming cap for about $10 to swim in the indoor pool. This was annoying but not enough to sour my stay."
58,36,"Aug 5 2006 	So so	Location: not the best, wrong side of Tianammen SqRooms: we got upgraded, so happy with size, but decor outdatedStaff: nice, helpfulValue: you get what you pay forIf you can take the location, I recommend staying therePS: asked for a private tour to the wall WITHOUT any 'shopping' (i.e. jade factory tourist traps) stops - were made to stop anyway, so beware"
59,36,"Jul 24 2006 	Not a 4 star hotel	The Marco Polo Beijing is a just &quot;ok&quot; hotel that doesn't live up to its 4 star rating. Yes, the rooms were clean and the location was decent, there wasn't anything spectacular about the hotel at all. My wife and I found the room to be dark and uninviting, although we weren't in it other than to sleep. I don't have anything horrible to say about the Marco Polo, but there isn't much good either. Really it is just an average hotel that will disappoint if you are expecting luxury, service, or special amenities."
60,36,"May 31 2006	Great value friendly and conveniently located hotel	I booked the marco polo hotel using airline network and for 68 per room per night including breakfast it was by far the cheapest price. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from a Tube station and a shopping mall is also close by. Due to Beijing being so big and the sights so spread out we found being close to the tube extremely convenient and at appox 30p to use the tube a cheap option to get around. The reception is beautiful and all staff were very friendly and helpful even allowing us to leave our cases there for 2 days whilst travelling to Xian. On our first 2 nights stay we were upgraded to the continental suite which was on the 10th floor. The only real difference to standard rooms was a larger bathroom and shower cubical. The rooms were spacious with extremely confortable beds. You have a mini bar and free water along with all the usual free toiletries. The breakfast was lovely with a choice of fruit, breads, meats, cooked breakfast, cereals etc etc what you would expect from a 3-4 start hotel. My husband and I would certainly stay there again and would recommend it to our freinds and family."
61,36,"May 23 2006 	Great stay for business travel	Got a great rate for the Corporate Floor from the Marco Polo's internet site. Included breakfast, laundry and pressing service, afternoon tea, evening drinks, chocolates on the pillow, etc. Room, bed, shower, internet access, all great. Check-in and check-out very efficient. Hotel staff very helpful in getting taxis and ensuring destination was understood by the driver. Hotel is situated between two subway lines - 3 minute walk to either stop. Second floor restaurant a little slow but reasonable prices. All in all, I highly recommend based on my experience."
62,36,"May 22 2006	competent hotel	Hotel is clean and quite well situated.No hotel meets all normal criteria for location in Beijing, and this one is fine for taxis to central sites, and for Summer Palaces. For Chaoyang (entertainment district= red light area in a very mild way) it's a bit of a hike. Room on 9th floor had queen bed and was a no-smoking room.Room cleaning was efficient- going to breakfast leaving the &quot;please make up&quot; sign meant it invariably was.Breakfast buffet was fine- the usual stuff. Things that ran out got replenished quickly.Staff language skills pretty good- outside staff would translate into Chinese for the driver, and the card was fine for getting you back to the hotel. Near two metro stations but we rarely used the metro, as 3 people meant a cab was the same price and didn't involve the ubiquitous stairs.Shop next door sold water, biscuit bars , beer at silly low prices.No restaurants of note nearby, although Times Square Plaza, about 3 mins walk away has Starbucks and a few decent fast-ish food places, including a Japanese, a Korean and &quot;be There or Be Square&quot;(Cantonese).Hotel restaurant OK- although the only one open is the buffet/ a la carte place. No in-house Cantonese at present. Foyer bar ok, usual high-ish prices.We took the Hutong tour from the hotel, and were very pleased. We went into a courtyard house, chatted via our guide with the owner over a tea, then visited a school. This is run by an outside organisation, but our concierge was genuinely interested in how we found the tour- and indeed on talking about the UK."
63,36,"May 10 2006	Complete Mediocrity	After staying recently at the Marco Polo Hotel, I have to say that they have a long long long way to go before they can hope to host the crowds for the Olympics. In that sense, the hotel was a reflection of Beijing in general.Some objections:1. My requests for a nonsmoking room off the street were ignored (and no, Febreeze does not suddenly make a room NonSmoking).2. The level of English at the hotel was poor. I know that my Mandarin is nonexistent, but can the Concierge please speak English or German or French? Also, the Concierge seems to have no idea how to read a map or an address in Chinese!! My friend and I knew more about the layout of Beijing in 2 days than any of the Concierges did! We would show them the address in English and Mandarin, plus where it was on the map, and they still had to make phone calls to figure it out. Amazing. They also have no knowledge whatsoever of what is happening in town. We had to figure that out ourselves too. Thanks &quot;Time Out Beijing&quot;!3. The tour coordinator tries to swindle you into paying for extras that you do not want. For instance - I wanted to see the Great Wall - not a number of kitschy shops, tea rooms, etc. Beware. They practically kidnap you, as the guides they used are paid commission on your purchases at these cheesy locations. No thanks! We strenously objected, but the tour guide said we had to do what he said. Unbelievable. They will also try to charge you double or triple for the Opera. No need.4. We were charged a fortune for a pot of coffee in our room ($20usd). And when i pointed out that this must be an error, they were incredibly rude and refused to budge although they could not produce the receipt that I supposedly signed to agree to payment. My advice - either splurge for the really nice hotels like Grand Hyatt or go for a small, cheaper guest house in a Hutong. The Marco Polo was the worst of both worlds. No charm, No service.If you do stay there, be sure to rent a bicycle and ride away from the joint like the wind!"
64,36,"Apr 27 2006 	A good choice for budget travelers	I stayed there couple times in the past few years. Not sure about other rooms in the hotel, since I've always stayed on the 10th floor Continental Club Level. My first stay was excellent and impressive, even after I just stayed at Four Seasons in Tokyo. The interior of the hotel was elegant with charming details. They gave me an oversized room with a perfect view of TianAnMen Square and the National Theater. The bathroom, however, was too small. Water pressure in the shower and the toilet was less than satisfactory. The 2nd time staying there, they put me in a really small room, which was a big disappointment especially for a return gurest. Because I arrived at 11:30pm, I was too tired to switch to another room. I had a cleaning lady knocking on my door and entered the room without permission. She didn't speak any English and was looking for something until another staff member came in to chase her away. Strange! The staff at the Continental level was very friendly and helpful. Location of this hotel is good, convenient yet away from city center with only a short walk to nearest subway stations and shopping malls. I stopped staying there since the price is fairly low and there were more and more local guests staying there with nonstop cigarette smoking and loud conversations. I really loved the decor and the class this hotel had. Unfortunately, the constant crowds of domestic and international tourist groups made this place much less attractive than before. Also, I've discovered the new Intercontinental Hotel, which is on the top of my list right now."
65,36,"Apr 25 2006	Good enough	Stayed at the Marco Polo Beijing last week, and I guess I had high expectations. All in all the hotel was ok. The best thing about it was the lobby which gives you the impression of class and good things to come. It was very quiet and clean- none of the busy-ness of more commercial hotels. Buffet meals were average to above average. The room was nice in an understated way with nice cottony sheets. But I just have to say, for those who are maniacally clean, that the bathroom had a few stray hairs and used floss on the floor when I arrived. (Eeeeew) I presume its from the previous people.Internet was also expensive at about 70 yuan for less than 30 minutes.About location, hmmmmm, this isnt such a great location if you plan to do some walking around the hotel area. There's nothing beside or in front of it. There's a huge construction going on beside, so it seems like the only place really in that area. But nearby, is a commercial center with some shops but you will have to cross a really wide avenue. Or maybe just take a cab.If you are going to be traveling by bus or cab all the time, then the location is fine."
66,36,"Mar 27 2006	Great choice in this price category	At almost half the price of the luxury hotels in Beijing, the Marco Polo is a great choice for a clean and comfortable stay in Beijing. Though 5 stars may be a bit generous (4.5 was not an option), everything at the hotel was quite nice. Please note that there is some construction next to the hotel, but all of the guests I encountered on my stay were upgraded to jr suites or put on the west side of the hotel and did not have noise problems. Make sure to ask. The rooms were everthing you'd expect from a 4 star and they were fairly clean and new by China standards. The staff and concierge were polite and very helpful. The breakfast buffet was plentiful with western and chinese options. Beijing is very spread out and there is really no central location to stay. This property is slightly out of the way. You can walk to the Forbidden City from here, but it's a long half hour walk. There is a lovely Hutong area across the street for strolling and dining (there is a great dumpling house) and a few department stores down the street. But be prepared to take taxis nearly everywhere in Beijing no matter where you stay."
67,36,"Jan 27 2006	Very Satisfied	I stayed here 3 nights in early November and was very satisfied. Make sure your room isn't on the side where there's construction going on. The room was nice and large, the breakfast buffet was good. You're not walking distance to anything but the taxis are so cheap it's not an issue. Anyway the sights around Beijing are so spread out there really isn't one central location. But if you're back at the hotel by evening time there's no where else really to eat out the door. The staff was great and we arranged tours in the lobby tour desk. The best were the Forbidden City, Great Wall, Summer Palace, and Bike Tour through the hutongs. We booked the Marco Polo because the price was right so if you're looking for something modern and comfortable but want to save a bit of money I'd recommend this hotel."
68,36,"Nov 25 2005	really so so hotel	We stayed there for three nights in Oct. compairing the one (Westin in Shanghai), langhamm palce at Hongkong, this hotel is just not even close. Staffs are reading newspaper at work (in the lobby), there is no one to get a cab for you. The hotel just looks like 70s hotel. Carpets are dirty. I read the other review a bit, frankly, I don't agree with them at all. Probably I have a bit high expectation. Yes, the location is not bad. But the service and hotel itself really need a lot of improvement. Overall, the best service is at Hongkong, and Shanghai. Beijing is just about 5 to 10 years behind. We won't stay there again."
69,36,"Oct 24 2005	Great hotel	I stayed at the Marco Polo in late September 2005 and loved it. The staff all speak English and are very helpful; the breakfast was great; the fitness centre, though small, had all I needed; and it was well located, being only about 50 metres from the Xi Dan underground station, which is a 2 yuan ride to Tien An Men Square and the Forbidden City. Being upgraded to a junior suite was a real bonus! I will stay here again if I go back to Beijing and recommend it unreservedly to everyone."
70,36,"Oct 13 2005	Marco Soso	I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights just last week. Yes, it is a good location, and yes, it was clean. That's about it. The breakfast was not very good, runny eggs, undercooked bacon, unattentive wait staff and a chef that didn't want to cook.The rooms are very plain and out dated. Toilet paper is more like sand paper. Thin towels and they didn't want to give us anymore unless we turned in the ones we had. The carpet seems clean, but looks very used, in the rooms and in the hallways.The lobby staff was nice, but none of the doormen we encountered spoke english, and were unable to help with making sure our taxi driver knew where to take us. Thankfully, we had a business card that had the major sites written in Chinese that we could show to our driver.We also stayed four nights at the Marriott Beijing West, what a difference! See review on Marriott for more info."
71,36,"Oct 13 2005	Rate it 7 out of 10	The good: 1) Spacious rooms, nice linen, and the concierge will be quite keen to upgrade you if you are not happy with your room. All you need to do is politely complain, and they will come to your aid. We got a room facing an enormous construction site, and since they work 24/7 in Beijing, we decided to complain. We got a fancy suite facing the main street, which was quiet; the bathrooms are quite large with both a shower and a bath-tub (bath tub not reccomended though - black spots spitting out of the faucet and yellow water put us off a bit)2) People are bangig on about location in some of the reviews. I seriously don't understand the complaint. Mind you, Beijing is an enormous city, and ridicolously crowded, which in itself makes it a hard place for pedestrians; furthermore, taxi's are affluent and so cheap that it is hard to believe. We never paid more than about 2 USD almost anywhere we went, so in my world, it doesn't really matter where you are in this city, as long as you are somewhere inside the city, and not out by the airport or near a cest pit somewhere. Taxi is your key, and the easiest way to get around. Bring a map to show to cab drivers with names in Chinese - it will make everything a lot easier. 3) Staff was helpful, albeit language is an issue - but that was expected, so it didn't really matter.The bad:1) I mentioned all the construction in Bejing - which again leads to a lot of dust and dirt. Beijing isn't the cleanest city in the world, and this fact goes badly with carpets. Even though this hotel is fairly new, it looked old mainly due to the filthy carpeting throughout the hotel. The Chinese are also famous for their &quot;spitting in the streets&quot; habbit; I know a lot of guests wear their shoes inside; all this add to the icky feeling you get when you take your shoes off after a long day and stick your bare feet on a rather filthy rug. I have never really used hotel slippers that much before, but in this location they came in handy.2) The staff at the breakfast buff needs to change their attitude and do a better job. They tend to be a bit snippy and the are not attentive at all when food items run out, when you want more tea or honney and the like; 3 out of 5 days they were out of scrambled eggs and other things; all three times I had to ask them to sort some more out. No biggie, but three times over you start getting a bit annoyed, especially when the buff is expensive, and not that great.3) They brag about their indoor pool; it is OK but nothing fancy. What is worse, they force you to buy a swimming cap for 60 Juan before you are allowed to enter. A bit cheeky I thought, and it made everyone look ridiculous. One size does NOT fit all Europeans. But the pool was clean, which is good (it really should be in a 4 star so...).All in all: a good deal, and it is a great starting point for tours and trips to various sites outside and inside the city. If they got rid of their rugs and got wooden floors or similar instead, then it would be 5 star, and a much better, and more hygenic experience, for all guests. This will not bother brits - and Americans for that matter - since they seem to have the same nasty habbits with rugs as the Chinese - and many other countries for that matter, but for all Scandinavians who are accustomed to materials which makes it easy to dodge dirt and not collect it over time, the rugs at this hotel can be slightly off-putting. 1 point off for the breakfast staff, and two points off for filty, scrubby rugs: I give it 7 out of 10."
72,36,"Oct 12 2005	Marco Polo? Marco Polo!	Just like Beijing's Panjiayuan Antique Market, this place delivers the &quot;goods,&quot; at a deep discount relative to what you would pay in the U.S. or Europe. At $110 (U.S.) or 891 Chinese Yuan Renminbi per night (all charges and breakfast included) this hotel is a great deal. The rooms are modern with comfortable beds to ease your jet lag. The pool, fitness center, sauna, and steam room are blissful (see photos).Internet access is available from your room, there is a business center in the lobby, and most staff speak English. But it's the complimentary breakfast buffet, with all the Western and Chinese standards and a few extras (such as my favorite Swiss cereal) that really seals the deal. Located in Beijing's booming Xi Dan area, it's a short walk to the Xi Dan metro and its surrounding complex of high-end retail shops and restaurants. There's a 5-story underground mall connected to the metro, with a 3-D movie theatre and swimming pool/skating rink. The new Capital Times Square retail complex features luxury brand stores (with prices like in the U.S.) but also has an excellent food court (with prices much lower than in the U.S.). For example, a Dairy Queen Blizzard costs 90 cents. From the hotel, it's a short cab ride to many of the major sites, including The Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, the Temple of Heaven, or the ritzy Wangfujing Street/Oriental Plaza/Grand Hyatt shopping area (all under $5 rides). If you take the subway, it's less than a dollar. The hotel concierge can arrange tours to The Great Wall or anywhere else. You can change money at the airport (keep receipt and you can convert it back upon departure) or at the hotel desk. A few tips: Although 100 Yuan is only about $12, you will be able to buy meals for much less than this, and even brand-name (e.g., Adidas, Diesel, and Lacoste) &quot;knock-offs&quot; or fakes for less than this at popular tourist markets like Ya Show and Hong Qiao Shichang. So, make sure you have some small Yuan bills because, on rare occasions, if you hand out 100 Yuan for a 20 Yuan cab ride, Buddha statue, etc., you might get some counterfeit bills in your change. While shopping, remember to start of by offering a third or even a quarter of the asking price. Haggling is generally expected (and encouraged) here! In fact, even in hotels, high-end stores, and airport shops, you'll see that you can often easily lower the price by asking for their &quot;best price&quot; or if you don't seem interested, they'll offer you the &quot;discount price.&quot;"
73,36,"Oct 10 2005	New hotel in Beijing	My wife &amp; I had a four nights stay in the new hoel in Beijing a few blocks west of Teinanmin Square.Very good location for touring all attractions in Beijing.Our corner room was large, quite, clean and comfortableWill stay there again next time."
74,36,"Oct 6 2005	Lovely Boutique Hotel in the Middle of Smog City	We stayed at the Marco Polo for 8 nights and found it to be very good value due to an American Express special 3 nights for the price of 2 (each night was around US$105+15%). The hotel has an excellent location, situated between two subway stations on two different lines- this alone is almost worth the price of the room.We were upgraded to a room on the Executive Floor (rm1046) with a view of the construction site next door. The bathroom was beautiful- separate glass-enclosed shower, bathtub, marble detailing, great towels. The bed is very comfortable and furnished with feather quilt and pillows. TV has HBO, 3 news stations, ESPN and various Chinese channels.Staff are generally helpful and speak basic English (for excellent service and English, check for a chap called &quot;Winter&quot; at the Front Desk).A western breakfast buffet is served on the Executive Floor and drinks and cocktails are served at certain times throughout the day. Ok, now for the brickbats.-Although we LOVED the luxurious feel of the feather bedding, we had some problems with allergies and requested non-feather bedding. Our request was met with some limp pillows and ratty blankets.-The special rate of our room entitled us to breakfast for 1 person for the 8 nights we were staying. We negotiated with Winter at the Front Desk to divide the breakfasts between us (so, instead of 8 breakfasts for 1 person over 8 days, we would have 4 breakfasts for 2 people over 4 days)- we were very pleased with the arrangement however the next day after having breakfast, we were presented with a bill from the 'butler' on the 10th floor for one breakfast. She was very obstinate, had no idea about good customer service and told us (get this) that if we didn't pay, she would get Winter (the front desk clerk) to pay(!) so we had to get the manager in who cleared things up. This conflict played out throughout our stay, which made it a bit stressful during breakfast! By the way, breakfast really wasn't worth all the hassle- the usual hotel buffet spread, no Chinese options and TEA-BAGS! Can you believe it?!-We can't say for sure what happened, but my partner 'lost' US$20 from some money he had (unsuccessfully) hidden and I 'misplaced' some dried persimmons I'd brought from Singapore. OK, we should have used the safe for the money, but you'd think that some dried fruit would be safe from pilfering fingers?!-ROOM SERVICE FOOD IS AWFUL! One night, after doing 10KM hike on the Great Wall, we came back too late to dine at our favourite restaurant and ordered some Chinese items from the room service menu- quite possibly the most awful room service meal we've ever had the misfortune to digest. If you MUST eat in your room, try to get some dim sum from the third floor restaurant delivered to your room.-Concierge is a joke- direct all inquiries to Winter. -Access to quality newspapers is terrible- they have only one copy of the International Herald Tribune and The South China Post on the 10th Floor and they guard it jealously- no taking it back to the room to enjoy at your leisure!"
75,36,"Sep 22 2005	great except for location	Spacious room, drinkable tap water, helpful staff who spoke pretty good English. Dining room &quot;okay,&quot; not great. Oddly, breakfast buffet cost more than either lunch or dinner buffet. Only big drawback was location. Not in walking distance of anything interesting. Only 2 restaurants nearby. One was very expensive and the other (across the street) double charged us for dinner."
76,36,"Sep 9 2005	Fantastic Find	Stayed at the Marco Polo for 3 nights. Great rooms, lovely bathrooms and very attentive staff. Great location for T-square and Forbidden City. Can't say anything bad about it!"
77,36,"Sep 7 2005	A Marvelous Hotel at a Great Price	I just got back from four nights at the Marco Polo, as a result of the reviews on tripadvisor and the information in Frommers. I stayed on the Continental Floor for $110 a night for a double room including breakfast buffet (which was delicious).The Marco Polo is a beautiful hotel, with wonderful access to Beijing's subway system. The lobby will seduce you. The large room and marble bath were wonderful. The linens were of the highest quality. Amenities include slippers, bathrobes, umbrellas, late check out (until 4pm) along with the ordinary. The room was quiet and comfortable. They also have a large pool and very well equipped health club.The staff was great. They assisted me any number of times. It seems that the best price can be had on the hotels webpage.The only negative I could find is that the tours at the tour desk were overpriced. But isn't that always the case? You can arrange your own tours by using the advice in Frommers or almost any quidebook for half the price. Most of the comparable hotels were over $175 a night. The Marco Polo is a spectacular hotel and it's a steal."
78,36,"Aug 16 2005	Great for business or please	Stayed at the Marco Polo for a week in May at the very end of a longer stay in China. Needed to get some work done while there, they had a great business center. They have a luxury business center on the top floor of the hotel. Rooms and bathrooms and very large and very luxurious. Look on line for a deal on the &quot;continental club&quot;. Top floor rooms include use their the private library, large screen tv lounge, a great breakfeast buffet, and private discrete check-in. It was very VIP and comfortable. The location of the hotel was pretty good, on a nice day I walked to Tienammen and the Forbidden City. It was about a 20 minute walk. Also, while I was there they were finishing an opera house right across the street, should be ready soon. The conceirge was great, decent prices on tours (of course you can do better on the street) but by the end of my trip I was looking to fit in alot of things without any risk. Did their Great Wall tour, the Ming Tombs tour and the Peking Opera night. They negatiated cabs for us and recommended great places for all our needs. The resturant was pretty good, overpriced, but worth it for the convenience, same for the bar in the lobby.Highly Recommended"
79,36,"Aug 5 2005	Lovely oasis in the Big City	I stayed for five nights in the Marco Polo Beijing and really enjoyed coming back to my large, clean, comfy room after a day in Beijing's July heat. The staff was helpful and friendly, the room service food is quite good when you're just too tuckered to go back out, and the location is convenient: 15-20 minute walk to Tianenmen Square and very close to two metro stations.I'd recommend this for its quiet serenity and clean comfort."
80,36,"Jul 28 2005	Excellent hotel	I stayed in the MP in July 2005 and found it to be an excellent hotel. The room was spacious, clean, and well-appointed. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste, but it wasn't uncomfortable. The location was good, a short walk to the Xidan subway station and shopping area. It's about a mile west of Tiananmen Square. Since a subway ticket is about 30 cents and taxis are quite cheap and efficient, location may or may not be a major factor, however. Service was very attentive and courteous. The facilities (pool, gym, jacuzzi, locker room, Cafe Marco) were very nice. I would stay in this hotel again."

1,40,Nov 26 2009 	Good locationclean	Stayed five nights as from 19th of October. Had a quite room on high floor . Enjoyed the good location (nearly walking distance to Tianmen square and Temple of Heaven) and good transportation point near Railway and subway! Enjoyed our stay. Recomended !
2,40,"Nov 13 2009 	A bit dated but ok	Just across the road from the main railway station, I was able to check in at 8am following an overnight journey on the train from Shanghai. The Harmony is a little dated, however the room was a good size and very clean. There is kettle with tea, safe for valuables, mini bar and hte usual toileteries. However on the down side there was no bath (only shower), just one curious state run English TV channel, the air con didn't work and the bed was very hard. The foyer bar never seemed to be open and the one breakfast I had was poor, nothing left with an hour still to go - so get there early! Reception staff speak only a little English but enough to get by, they helped me hail a cab and explain to the driver where I needed to go. There's not much in the way of shops and restaurants in the immediate area, however the Oriental Plaza, the biggest shopping mall in Asia, is just a 10-15 minute walk away. And as you can imagine, you can find everything there!"
