1,367,This hotel deserves praise	I was unaware that my watch was on 4:00 pm EST and checked-in prematurely. It was therefore only 1:00 p.m. I think it was the manager who was behind the front desk who took me in without complaint or a whimper. There is nothing fancy about this B&amp;B but it is clean and comfortable. I did not have much interaction with the staff but I did not find any rudeness in them. The unlimited free breakfast was excellent. Much better when I last stayed at a La Quinta in L.A. I will definitely come back if I get a nice deal again.
2,367,"Nov 13 2009 	Nice hotel not too close to the Strip	Room was clean and very quiet, even know it was close to a Main road. Upper rooms would get a nice view of the neon lights of the Vegas casinos. Two big queen beds, very soft and comfortable. When we couldn't get the tv going, maintence man came promptly and was very pleasant. Breakfast had a big variety of hot and cold items  eggs, sausage patties, biscuits &amp; sausage gravy, toast, bagels, cereal, muffins &amp; pastries, coffee/juice. Staff were polite and seemed helpful. We were very.happy with our stay there, especially after a long sleepless flight, it was lovely to relax in such a comfortable room. My only little complaint was there was no complimentary bottle of shampoo/conditioner, only body wash &amp; body lotion. No restaurants within walking distance."
3,367,"Oct 27 2009 	Pretty Decent	This hotel has a surprisingly good view of the strip if you are on the right side of the hall! The room was pretty clean, the staff was pretty nice, and the hotel seemed to always be packed with cars at night, which I find comforting knowing that I'm not the only one there. However, the security probably needs to be improved a little. About 2-4 times a day, there would be a pizza flier slid under my door (probably from some kid the pizza business hired to improve sales).. And on the door, going in the side of the hotel, it clearly states &quot;no soliciting&quot; ... So either the hotel doesn't care that these people are just coming in and soliciting, or they are really oblivious to who are their guests and who are not... (I would never buy pizza from a company that does this by the way)They have a shuttle that goes to Mandalay Bay and MGM which is good. I did not use that service, since it only goes till 12AM... Which is odd, since most people in Vegas stay out till way past then, I'd assume..The bad part of the hotel is that there was NO fridge....... I hate that. I mean, you're in a desert and they have no fridge... like wtf? I paid like $80 plus $10 or $12 or so for taxes each night... I think that's probably just about the right price, although it'd be better if it was lower : )It's a good place to stay at if you're in Vegas for more than a few days, because it gives you a chance to get away from the rustle and bustle and hustle of the casinos."
4,367,"Sep 5 2009 	clean and new	Found the hotel to be worth the 160 for 3 nights. Decent free breakfast, shuttle service to the strip was excellent too. Rooms were clean and the facilties were fine. The pool area was also well maintained apart from the plunge pool being out of order. If your on a short trip to LV and looking for a clean affordable hotel then i would go for this place. No complaints what so ever. P.s try the bar at the top of &quot;the hotel&quot; for a great view of the strip. The shuttle drops you off there. Fab!"
5,367,"Sep 3 2009 	Fantastic Service	Having driven from the Grand Canyon where we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, we were delighted with the service at this one which was so different from the nights before. No criticisms at all. Really good time and a fantastic selection of in room dining too which was great with small children."
6,367,"Aug 31 2009 	Just Average	We were in Las Vegas for only one night before flying home after a two week vacation in Utah, and chose this hotel over one of the large hotels so we could be close to our vehicle in the parking lot for &quot;repacking purposes&quot; because we had a lot of luggage. Their complimentary shuttle goes to Mandalay Bay (south on the strip) and the MGM Grand (middle of the strip), so when we found ourselves at the Bellagio (north on the strip) at the end of the evening, we opted to take a taxi back to the hotel. It cost about $11 but was worth it after all the walking we'd done. Our bathroom could have been cleaner, and I forgot to ask for a room on the top floor so we had to listen to people stomp around above us. The breakfast buffet was typical Holiday Inn Express but the young woman tending to it was awesome. It was ten minutes until it ended and she was still bringing out fresh hot food, restocking everything, and cleaning the tables. She made my day."
7,367,"May 28 2009	Clean quiet and affordable	Loved the free shuttle to the Strip. Nice, big breakfast every day. Quiet pool. Little bit of problem with reservation number we were given but this was solved the next day and no more problems. Rooms were big and clean. Would have liked to have an airport shuttle from the airport and extended hours for the airport shuttle to the airport as we ended up needing to get taxis both ways. Overall a good experience."
8,367,"May 12 2009 	Fabulous!	A very clean hotel, with friendly staff. Free internet access was brilliant, and we were grateful of the shuttle. Breakfast typical, but plenty of choice and ample to eat! Swimming pool was brilliant, we were often the only ones in it! Room excellent, we had a room overlooking the airport, no notable noise from this, in fact we enjoyed sitting on the end of the bed watching the planes take off!I'm glad we didn't stay on the strip, it was nice to get away from the hussle and bustle. Would definitely stay here again, oh and the price was extremely reasonable."
9,367,"May 6 2009 	Top Notch	The hotel, service, and most of all everybody is smiling.Just gets you feel welcome and comfortable."
10,367,"Feb 25 2009 	Great Location Clean Reasonable Price	An absolute pleasure. I'm so glad I didn't stay on the strip (I've heard and read horror stories). The staff was friendly and helpful (check-in was quick). The room and bathroom was clean and appropriately sized for the price. I was on the 3rd floor facing the strip, so the view was amazing.I appreciated the free parking, free internet, and free breakfast. The place was easy to find and there was plenty of parking available right in front of the hotel. Not only did I have free internet in my room, but they had a free printer in the lobby. I've had minor issues with HIE in other cities, but this one was great and I have zero complaints."
11,367,"Jan 26 2009 	Excellent for the money	I was very pleased with my stay at the Holiday Inn Express. The staff was pleasant and helpful, the rooms were relatively spotless and the continental breakfast was above average. The location off the strip was great, especially since it was only a 10 minute shuttle ride away. It was also convenient that they had an airport shuttle. I would positively recommend this hotel for your next Las Vegas visit."
12,367,"Jan 24 2009 	Want to go Off Strip? This is the place to stay.	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for 5 nights including Christmas Day. The location, whilst off the strip was merely a 10 minute free shuttle journey to the Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand Hotel on the strip. It is very conveniently located for the airport and Eagle Riders, if you are into hiring motorcycles. The staff was very helpful and friendly, the room was clean and reasonably spacious. The bathroom was well equipped with a decent hairdryer, the only minor thing was that the bath was very shallow not good for wallowing in!Breakfast was a rolling program hot/cold buffet, perfectly adequate without being excessive, carry out bags were available for early starts or mid-morning snacks.We were very impressed with the level of customer service, we were waiting for the shuttle one very cold evening at the MGM Grand when it became apparent that it was never going to appear. One quick phone call to the Hotel Receptionist and we were in a taxi that they paid for (including the tip)."
13,367,"Sep 2 2008	Clean Comfortable and A//C too!	After a bad experience at a striip hotel ( no A/C ), we checked out of that hotel, and into the Holiday Inn, (we visited out friends the next day at the Westin, and they still had no A/C in the lobby, the restaurants, casino and lounge. We never noticed any airplane noise, but we always carry several pair of earplugs, anyway. We rested so well after the HOT room at the Westin. (the Westin employees said that it had been hot for about three days prior to our arrival, also) We had a lovely stay at the Holiday Inn and would now consider staying there next time."
14,367,"Aug 28 2008	Another good example of this chain	We chose this hotel for its close location to the airport and car rental depot. We were going to start touring the next day and just wanted a convenient hotel where we could park easily outside. At the time of booking, we could have got a Strip hotel for fewer $, but who wants to park half a mile away from your room for just a one night stay?The king size bed was divinely comfortable and very clean. We made full use of the free internet access, as, having flown from the UK with an 8 hour time difference, we were up a few hours before breakfast was served at 6 am!The breakfast itself was good with all the usual fare of bagels, cereals, muffins etc plus some hot items.If you are travelling from the UK a word of caution if you are taking SatNav with you and hiring a car. It took a long time for our new TomTom to kick in (next day in fact) and so I was glad I had printed out instructions of how to get to the hotel.The next week when we returned to Las Vegas we were confronted by the traffic horrors afforded by the Strip area, but thankfully, this hotel saved us from that on our first night. We got exactly what we wanted."
15,367,"Aug 24 2008 	Spot On	Found this hotel to be just what we had hoped for. Speedy check in, pleasant staff, nice room, clean hotel, good pool and hot tub (virtually had it to ourselves). Breakfast was good, Freshly baked cookies at 16:00 hrs. Shuttle service was always on time, every 30 mins to Mandalay Bay and every hour to MGM. The only problem with this service is at night when the shuttle may have to make more than one journey due to numbers so expect to have to wait sometimes. If you don't have a car as we didn't then you have to go to the strip to eat as there is nothing close. There is a gas station near which sells drinks and snacks though. There was some plane noise but it never bothered us. Would recommend this hotel if you want to be away from the strip."
16,367,"Aug 6 2008 	Rude Employees Horrible Customer Service!	On the day of my arrival I called to request an early check in for my 2 rooms, I was told I could check in @ 10:30 am! I was really happy and didn't expect such an early check in, I was thinking I would be able to check in around 1pm. We arrived at 11:30 am, and got all of our luggage out of the car. The woman at the desk just stared at us, didn't even greet us or wlecomed us. We told her we were checking in, she immediately responded by saying &quot;Oh no, we don't have any rooms available right now!&quot; I told her that I had called earlier that moring and was given an early check in, she did not believe me and asked who I spoke to. I told her I spoke to a man around 8:30am, she looked to her sides and said, &quot;NO, I have no rooms available right now, give me 20 minutes and I'll check you in!&quot; We sat in the lobby for 30 minutes. After waiting, we got all of our luggage out of the car and walked towards the front desk again. The man who promised me an early check was there, and we asked why did he guaranteed an early check in? His response was, &quot;Maybe, I said you would get an early check in.&quot; I asked again what time we could I check into my rooms. The man in the front desk replied, &quot;45 mintues to an hour!&quot; So then, I walked around for about 2 1/2 hours in the scorching sun, after a 5 hour drive, which wore out my 5 year old son. We went back to the hotel again and they told us the same thing, &quot;may be in an hour!&quot; At this point my entire family decided to change our reservations to another hotel which was much more friendlier and proffesional. The sad part out of all of this is that it wasn't just us that they were rude to. We witnessed how a couple tried to check out but the man at the desk would not give them a receipt because they had checked in earlier that morning. The front desk clerk kept telling the guest that he didn't have to check out until the next morning, that there was no way he could get a receipt. But as soon as the guest that wanted to check out said I'm paying cash, the clerk said Ohh, OK let me check you out!!! What was that about? CASH ONLY?! Management needs to have a talk to the employees about their customer service skills. I mean this man was talking on his cell phone in a loud voice at the front desk! I AM NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT PLACE, NEITHER ARE MY CUSTOMERS, FAMILY AND FRIENDS!"
17,367,"Jul 25 2008 	I would stay here again!	We (i.e. 2 adults and 2 teenagers from UK) wanted to stay somewhere that wasn't totally focussed on gambling and we achieved it with this HI Express. Stayed here 4 nights, and really pleased we didn't stay on the Strip. It was really convenient though because a complimentary shuttle bus runs every 30mins to the nearby Mandalay Bay, and hourly to the MGM Grand Hotel, delivering you to the heart of the action. But the noise of the Casinos can drain your energy if you're not into gambling or if you're with kids, so it is really great to stay off the Strip as I said. We had a 2 Queen bed-suite with sofa bed, and the sofa bed was all rusted and the springs were broken. Room 324. We told reception and they sent up a roll-away bed, but this was all broken too and actually held together by a polythene bag. Anyway, the next day the staff moved us to a room with a safe and functioning sofa bed (room 218 for info), and from then on we had no problems at all. The breakfast was standard HI Express fare, and coffee was available most of the day in the lobby. Laundry facilities (powder was provided for us), ice, vending for cokes, etc no problem.Reception staff were fairly friendly, but everything and everyone in Vegas is larger than life, somewhat brash and loud to the point of enjoyable. Hotel pool smallish, but adequate, and a welcome cool-off in the heat. It was always quiet round the pool. Overall, excellent value (and as other reviewers say, the money you save by booking here lets you spend on Cirque de Soleil, Grand Canyon etc). By the way, saw &quot;O&quot; and it was fantastic, saw Blue Man and it was good. If I visited Vegas again, (which I won't) I would stay here."
18,367,"Jul 22 2008 	Good Budget Option	Lets face it, there's so much to do in Las Vegas day and night that you need plenty of cash. This hotel was considerably cheaper than those on the strip, especially at the weekends, so saved us some cash to spend on going to see fabulous Cirque du Soleil. I've stayed on the strip before and hated having to wander through casinos in those enormous hotels just to get back to your room. The Holiday Inn Express was a good place to sleep and shower at a reasonable price, nothing fancy but clean and comfortable. We had a car so the location a few blocks behind the strip was great for getting about but far enough away to be a bit quieter. I have to agree that the soundproofing could be better as we had a rather noisy neighbour who had the TV on full blast all the time. To their credit the front desk did have a word with him but I think it fell on deaf ears. Overall it's a good option for those who want to save their cash for Las Vegas' many distractions."
19,367,"Jul 9 2008 	Excellent Stay at HI Express	What a wonderful gem in las vegas! Peaceful, easy to find, and a great staff! The hotel is situated right off of the end of the strip, about a 3 minute drive from Mandalay Bay. It is great because you are so close to the strip, but you dont have to walk for miles through a casino to find your room. The rooms were nice, standard holiday inn express rooms but always very clean and comfortable. The pool and hot tub were very nice, and the times I used the pool there were hardly any other people ever there. They had outdoor showers and private bathrooms right by the pool which was very convenient. The hotel sits near many main roadways, but I never heard a single noise from the roads. If you get a room facing the front of the hotel, you will also get a wonderful view of the strip! Quite a view at night time.The hotel does offer complimentary shuttles to Mandalay bay but they only happen every hour and stop around 11PM. There also is a free shuttle to the airport that departs every hour which was very convenient. Breakfast was standard HI express fare, and they always had delicious cookies out for guests during the day and evening. The staff was extremely helpful as well with directions and advice. The one girl even remembered my name and always said hello to us. Overall, a clean, comfortable stay without all the craziness of being on the strip. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone!"
20,367,"May 23 2008 	Yet another positive Holiday Inn stay	As always I am very pleased with the Holiday Inn Express chain.. Met my expectations. Free breakfast, close to the strip, easy check in, nice/clean bathroom and short walk to room... The staff was also very friendly.. The only problem I had was with the hide a bed.. the linens that they gave us were WET !!! When I called in to get more linens they brought back more WET linens. So i sent those back.. On the 3rd try I finally got some sheets that were dry to put on the sofa bed.. The room was very comfy and quiet when we went to bed.. I did not notice the walls being thin at all.. (we also had the air on most of the time).. The holiday inn breakfast was great as always (altho the new omeletes kind of suck)... I love their cinnamon rolls.. The pool and hot tub were very nice as well and each time I went to them I was the only person.. (which I love!!).. The gym however was lacking. They had a treadmill, eliptical and a stepper. And a SMALL dumbell tree with dumbells only up to 10lbs.. (the holiday inns usually have a universal weight machine, but this one doesnt)... This place is a must if you rent a car as you can escape all the craziness of the strip when its time for bed.."
21,367,"Apr 26 2008 	Great for families	Our family of five stayed here for three nights, this was the only hotel that I could find that was able to accomodate us all in the one room in Las Vegas. All the other hotels on the strip wanted us to book two rooms, which would have made our trip twice as expensive.The room we had was at the front of the hotel and offered a great view of the strip, it was lovely to look out at the lights at night, when we returned to the hotel. The room was very big, it had two double beds and a double bed settee. It was clean and comfortable. The kids loved the heated pool and were in it late at night and early in the morning. The breakfast was just alright.The actual strip was surprisingly close by and we did not feel that disapointed on the hotels location (to far to walk though). The hotel offered a shuttle service every half hour to the Mandalay Bar/MGM. We did not have to use our hire car and made full use of this service while we there, which was great..Only negative was on checking in, we had been on the road was seven hours and arrived quite tired in the evening. When I spoke to the receptionist to give the family name, he just replied 'I need to see your id'. I told him that my actual passport was in my suitcase and I needed to unpack it to give it to him, his abrupt reply was 'well you are not checking in until I see it'! His unwelcoming attitude and abruptness nearly made me walk away, so I had no choice but to uppack my case in the reception in front of other guests walking by . I must add that all the other receptionists were great and extremely helpful."
22,367,"Apr 21 2008 	Great Alternative to the Strip	We usually go to Las Vegas each year for a business convention and have discovered the great deals of a few years ago no longer exist so we decided not to stay on the strip and opted for the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas. It was a good choice, just far enough away from the frenzy that is Vegas, but close enough to get to shows/restaurants etc. The hotel proivdes a shuttle service to the Mandalay Bay Hotel (where the convention was being held) every 30 minutes, and to the MGM Grand on the hour, so both my husband and I made good use of both these services. The MGM Grand was a better destination for me as it put me closer to the monorail or the bus service, whereas, getting off at the Manadalbay still meant a good 15 minute walk to the strip or to the monorail to the Excalibar Hotel.The hotel itself is standared Holiday Inn, rooms are functional but somewhat impersonal, but the beds are FANTASTIC, most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept in and the pillows are great too. They offer an express breakfast which is ok, cereal, yoghurt, toast etc, all on throwaway plates but it is included in the room rate. I would definitely stay here again, just for the simple fact there is no casino to have to walk through to get anywhere in the hotel is a bonus for me!"
23,367,"Apr 13 2008 	Not bad overall but some problems	I think this is the third time I've stayed here in three years and it has been relatively consistent, though I think it is a bit overpriced for what you get these days.The Good: hotel property and the rooms well maintained and clean. Friendly, helpful staff.The Bad: Thin walls - you can clearly hear conversations and the TV from the next door rooms. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't touch the hot food since it looked very unappetizing and I didn't want to risk getting sick on the plane home. The cold food was all on the cheap end of the scale. Not the worst 'free' hotel breakfast I've had, but nothing better than middle of the road - I expected more for the room price. Though the surrounding area seems relatively safe, it is mostly light-industry and, if you are not spending time on the strip, it is a bit of a drive to find a decent restaurant. The wireless internet connection was decently fast, but was out in the morning which prevented me from printing my boarding pass and completing some last minute flight preparations.Overall: I give it an average rating. More care given toward breakfast would put this hotel into the above average category."
24,367,Apr 4 2008 	Great budget option	We split our stay in Vegas moving off strip for the expensive holiday weekend. We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would definitely recommend it as a budget option. The staff were really friendly and helpful. We had the hotel pool and hot tub to ourselves most days and it was lovely and peaceful after the chaos of the strip. The hotel was clean and the other services - free internet and buffet breakfast were great. The hotel also ran a shuttle to the MGM once an hour and Mandalay Bay every half hour which was really handy.
25,367,"Mar 28 2008 	Great location but near the strip and no noise!	Excellent location, off the strip but very close to Mandalay Bay. Hotel offers a shuttle that runs to Mandalay Bay and MGM every 1/2 hour. Breakfast buffet ok but reasonable as it was free. Nowhere close to buy convenience items except the gas station next to the hotel. Swimming pool clean and fairly uncrowded. Housekeeping was good.Would stay again."
26,367,"Mar 25 2008 	comfy beds great service thin walls	We stayed here 3 nights in March. We were originally booked for just one night to be close to the airport (we had been hiking in Utah), but our flight was cancelled due to weather. The staff immediately rebooked us for the next 2 nights, at a rate cheaper than we had paid for our first night. I was very relieved. Overall, the service was great. Friendly front desk people and the breakfast bar was kept well stocked for the huge crowd that was staying here over the holiday weekend. The beds are very comfortable. My only complaint, and I see that others have noted this, is that you can hear your neighbors through the walls. This is my hotel pet peeve, so I am not sure if we would stay here again. Also, the return shuttle from Mandalay Bay is not reliable. You need to call the front desk to confirm that a shuttle will come by. We waited for an hour, and finally walked home (short walk, so not a big deal). Otherwise, this a good place to stay if you want to be near the airport, off the strip, and have a comfortable bed to sleep in."
27,367,"Mar 24 2008 	Best stay on our trip	March 20-22, 2008After traveling around for 10 days, we arrived at the HI Express. We were pleasantly surprised at how easily we found the hotel and were even more pleased with our room. We were greeted quickly and checked in right away. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and after driving from the Grand Canyon, they were very welcome. We were far enough off the road to have a quiet room but close enough that if you wanted to, walk to the Strip. (several blocks away), but why, when there is a convenient shuttle to take you to the MGM or the Mandalay Bay Hotels.Breakfast was a bit above average and filling. It was busy, so we kept having to ask when the muffins or juice were going to be refilled. There was a bit of a wait, since they had only 1 person staffing the breakfast. It was good and filling, a lot of variety.My only complaint is that there was trouble with the internet, which did get corrected and the front desk offered to print out our boarding passes if we needed.The AC in the room was a bit loud, but was efficient, if my son didn't keep messing with it."
28,367,"Mar 16 2008 	Great place for Race fans	My sister and i were in town for the Nascar (really) and chose the Holiday Inn for our 3 night stay largely due to the reasonable price. Having spent the first part of our stay at the MGM we were not bothered about being off-strip as most of our time would be spent at the racetrack.We checked in mid afternoon and although we did not have to wait in line, the phones rang non-stop so it did take a while to get checked in. To complicate matters our stay was split over two bookings, however the check in agent did a great job to keep us in the same room for the duration of our stay. This was much appreciated and only required us to get our key cards reactivated next morning.Our room was on a non smoking floor and was a good size with plenty of counter space and featured a TV and coffee maker. The beds were very comfortable and came with a selection of firm and soft pillows. The bathroom was also a good size with a hairdryer and had plenty of space for two girls worth of toiletries! The Holiday Inn's free breakfast did not disappoint and contained a varied selection of cereals, bagels, muffins, cinnamon rolls, yoghurts, eggs, bacon as well as juices and tea and coffee. It did seem to take a while for items to be replenished though when they ran out. There were staff around so i'm not sure what the cause of the delay was.As i mentioned this hotel is not located on the strip and is a good 10-15 minute walk to the Mandalay Bay Convention Centre on the strip. This is when the free shuttle comes in to its own. Running twice an hour to the Convention centre at the southern end of the strip and hourly to the MGM Grand this gives easy strip access for all. We found the shuttle drivers to be friendly and accommodating of everyones needs (especially the guy who dropped us right at the bus stop on the strip at 7am on Sunday morning to catch the bus to the track!). The complimentary return shuttle ride to the airport leaves one less thing to worry about.The Holiday Inn also has an outdoor pool, guest laundry and the free internet access in the lobby enabled us to get checked in for our flight home on our last day.Overall we enjoyed our stay and the Holiday Inn and the hotel more than served its purpose. I would primarily recommend this hotel for those on a budget and/or those with their own transport. The shuttle is good, dont get me wrong, but for first timers nothing quite beats direct access from hotel to strip."
29,367,"Mar 14 2008	Great Hotel says 4 Aussies!	My husband and I and another couple stayed here for 4 nights in a shared room with 2 queen size beds. The 4 of us were all of the same opinion-great hotel, friendly staff, location was great away from the strip, no problem with catching shuttle. Shared a taxi back in the wee hours so cheap between 4 of us. I had some queries before booking this hotel and emailed them direct. They were very prompt at replying and information regarding buses, weather, restaurants etc. also helpful when we hadn't visited Vegas before. Staff very friendly and helpful during stay. Returning to Vegas in September 2008 with my husband + 80 year old mother + sister and will certainly stay here again."
30,367,"Feb 25 2008 	Wished We Had Stayed Elsewhere	Overall, dissatisfied. Although we had read other users' comments about the paper-thin walls, we found this aspect particularly annoying. Never stayed in a hotel where the sound from adjoining rooms were so loud.There wasn't a comfortable chair in the room to sit in.Told by front desk (who were very friendly) to go to a neighboring hotel to use their computer because the printer at this hotel was broke.The breakfast sausage patties were smothered in grease; the eggs were cold.Only 1 of 2 elevators was working.Shame on Holiday Inn!"
31,367,"Feb 16 2008 	Aussie girls say ..excellent	Although this hotel is off the strip it is excellent value. We stayed 4 days in Jan 08....the money we saved we used for a 1st class helicopter flight into the Grand Canyon. Staff were very helpful, rooms were great, beds very comfy, linen &amp; towels were 1st class. Breakfast was included (continental) and plenty for us. Shuttle bus to the strip every half hour. Getting back not as reliable by shuttle but it's cheap &amp; easy to catch a cab back. We were very impressed &amp; would stay there again without hesitation."
32,367,"Jan 15 2008 	Good hotel	Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our vacation.We stayed at the Bellagio for the first 3 nights,but preferred our stay here.A good breakfast without having to queue or pay extra for! No lengthy walk through a smoky casino! Comfy beds and pillows, helpful friendly staff.Although we had a car we used the excellent shuttle services to Mandalay Bay and found the restaurants there very good-cheaper than the Bellagio and no queues even at Thanksgiving!"
33,367,"Jan 4 2008 	Love this hotel	We stayed in this hotel from 23rd Dec to 27 Dec 2007. It is a friendly, clean, cosy hotel for a family of three (2 adults and a 9-year old boy). The bed and blanket are very comfortable and clean. The room is spacious. The carpark is convenient. Their breakfast contains a varity of choice and most important yummy and free. The self laundry service is cheap and convenient. It is located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. Staff there are friendly and helpful. Though it is off from the Strip, the service of their shuttle buses are frequent. We did not find any problem to find easy and free parking in the Strip area, therefore did not worry about the transportation from Strip. Actually, we enjoyed the quiet and residential feeling of the neighbourhood than Strip area. The gasoline station is near and it is convenient for us to go any scenic and shopping areas, like the Red Rock Canyon, Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, Blouder City (There is a cafe/pub called Pizza ?? in Blouder City where the pizza and pasta are very delicious and yummy) , Premium Outlet, etc etc. The only complaint is that the wall of the rooms are a bit thin and the sewage of the bathtub did not work very well in our room, however acceptable. I will definitely go back to this hotel if I go to Las Vegas next time."
34,367,"Dec 18 2007 	Loved It!!!	My Husband and I, stayed at this location for 1 week the first week of December. We absoutley loved it here! It was our 5th trip to Vegas in 3 years and we have stayed at the Excalibur and MGM Grand previously. However we were very happy with this hotel. It is locoated about half a mile from the strip. They do offer free shuttle at the top and bottom of every hour to and from Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand. They also offer a free shuttle to the airport for departure only. The hotel room was large and very clean. Two large queen beds, which were very very nice. The was a large dresser and a desk and sofa area. The room also had a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge. The washroom was very clean and pretty big as well. We were on the third floor and asked for a &quot;strip&quot; view at check in and were upgraded for free to a room which faced the strip. It was pretty nice!The hotel does offer free breakfast every day which included, waffles, cereal, oatmeal, toast, yogurt, etc. There is no restaurant in this hotel, but there is a gas station next door where you can purchase snacks, etc. and the prices are pretty cheap. overall we loved this hotel. It was very quiet, non gaming hotel. The staff was very friendly and always smiled and said hello. We would diffently stay here again."
35,367,"Nov 10 2007 	More than meets expectations	If you just want a nice, quiet, non-casino place to stay in Vegas, then this place IS IT. We have stayed on other occasions at on strip, off strip and non gaming hotels and this one comes up tops (previous stays at the Golden Nugget, MGM Grand, Aladin, Courtyard, Candlewood Suites). Parking area was brightly lit The front desk staff was friendly and professional. Check-in/out was a breeze. The hotel lobby area was brightly lit. The room was large and functional. Both the room and bathroom were EXTREMELY clean. The bed and bedspreads were great. Very good mattress which was of medium hardness/softness depending on how you look at it. A big plus is the HIE touch to offer 2 of each kind of pillow (both firm and soft). The front desk mentioned that they are planning to upgrade their 27&quot; TVs to flat panels soon so do feel free to check with them if that is something important to you (wasn't a big deal to me since the TV worked very well). A reviewer earlier mentioned aircraft noise at this hotel. We didn't experience this at all. I really doubt that we would have missed the aircraft noise if they were &quot;booming&quot; overhead (try Hilton LAX for that one!). The free wireless is always great !"
36,367,"Nov 2 2007 	Good place to stay off the strip	We were catching a flight out of Las Vegas, so we stayed here one night. We're not gamblers, we went to the National Parks in Utah. It was a nice enough place to stay in Las Vegas. The bed was very comfortable, and we turned the fan on in the heating/ac unit so any noise didn't bother us at all. Clean, comfortable, good accommodation, good breakfast."
37,367,"Oct 28 2007 	good hotel rude guests	We stopped here for one night on our way out of Vegas. We had come from the MGM Signature so expected the HIE to be a low quality. Surprisingly, the hotel was very pleasant, with a large, clean and comfortable room, and typical HIE facilities. The guy at the front desk was polite and helpful. Unfortunately, the hotel was hosting a group of K-9 Police officiers who were on a training exercise. We got to see rather more of them than we would have liked as they were spending the afternoon next to the pool just like we were. They dominated the entire pool/hot tub area and were thoroughly obnoxious - swearing, drinking whisky from brown paper bags, shouting, fighting, and spilling alcohol in the pool. It's amazing that police officers could behave so appallingly. Although not a direct reflection on the quality of the hotel, it's a shame the staff didn't tone down their behaviour. However, what would they have done - call the police?!We'd stay here again - but would check they weren't hosting any cops first!"
38,367,Sep 1 2007 	Nice hotel	Good quality hotel. Superior beds and good breakfast. Excellent choice for those wanting a casino free hotel. One small improvement would be the inclusion of an airport shuttle pick up given the pricing position of the rooms.
39,367,"Aug 30 2007 	plane spotters dream	We found this hotel to be far noisier than staying on the strip! we stayed one night prior to flight back home and so wanted a quiet night. Planes were taking off almost overhead every 30 seconds or so till late at night and from early in the morning. Apart from the plane noise the air conditioning unit was very noisy and the walls are very thin.good points-rooms clean and tidy,pool ok and free breakfast buffet.There is a useful shuttle bus every half hour to and from the Mandalay Bay Hotel but too far from the strip if you want the &quot;vegas experience&quot;The hotel is in the middle of a developing business park close to the I15 on the other side of the strip. as for value for money can't complain at $70 per night but if wanting to get the best out of your stay pay more and stay on the strip"
40,367,"Aug 29 2007 	So near yet so Far...	Just returned from a fly drive to USA with my husband and 9 year old daughter- stayed in the Holiday Inn Express South Las Vegas for 3 nights. In my opinion it was absolutely perfect for our requirements. We had an executive twin Queen room which was much larger than average complete with microwave and full size fridge. The beds were so comfortable, although the air con unit was noisey. Location wise, it was just a five minute drive to the strip, where free parking is available at every hotel and also only ten minutes drive from the airport. It was great to be so near to the strip, but I was glad that we chose not to stay at the hotels there as they were loud, noisey and brash, just as you would imagen for a town called 'Sin City'. Breakfast was great with a good choice of cereals, yoghurt, friut, muffins, dainish pastries etc. Also it had a computer &amp; printer in reception area to enable you to look up stuff on-line or check your email. Pool was great with towels available, usually had it to ourselves. All in all I would definately stay in this hotel again, especially it you are travelling with kids."
41,367,"Aug 23 2007 	Just right!	This was the perfect Vegas hotel for us. With 2 children, aged 10 and 13 we did not want the full on, non-stop casino invasion of the main hotels on the Strip. The Holiday Inn Express was easily accessible, but yet away from the hustle and bustle. When we went into the pool we had it to ourselves! Not a slot machine in sight. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious, plenty of room for the 4 of us. We got the free shuttle to the Strip a couple of times but soon realised it was just as easy to drive to one of the hotel car parks on the Strip. The complimentary buffet style breakfast was great each morning with plenty of choice. We would definitely visit this hotel again."
42,367,"Aug 22 2007 	Great Place off of the Strip	We recently stayed at this Hotel two separate times in a 10 day span. We were taking a motorcycle trip to California and the Grand Canyon and stayed here at the beginning of the trip and for two nights when our trip was competed. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of this Hotel. It had a great pool that was opened to midnight which was great as we returned from our bike ride later in the evening and this was a great way to cool off. Our room was very nice, we had a King sized bed, a table with a chair and another chair in the corner. Bathroom was a nice size as well. Would be nice if all rooms had fridges but you could obtain one on a first come first served basis for $10 per day. We didn't bother as we put ice in the sink to cool our drinks. Breakfast was very good, had lots to choose from and had a very nice area to sit in. The fireplace in the middle of the room was a great touch. We left our suitcases with management while away and they stored them for us, away from where others could get into them. This was very nice of them. The shuttle was nice to have and goes to the Mandalay Bay every half hour. We felt this could be made better if you were allowed to call for a shuttle when done on the strip as sometimes we had to wait more than a half hour for our return shuttle. We would defenitely stay here again and I think that once they expand the strip that way, which they look like they are doing right now, this will be a prime place to stay."
43,367,"Aug 15 2007 	Well managed	A very warm welcome after a long trip from the UK. We were greeted with a smile and a choice of rooms. Everything was done to make us comfortable. The Air Conditioning was a little noisy but it had to work hard whilst we were there. Breakfasts were the usual motel style and of good quality. A maid was always on hand to replenish and tidy up. It was significant that the manager was frequently visible. This was unusual at other motels on this trip but she kept an eye on things and chased her front line staff when appropriate. This motel might not be on the strip but there is a free shuttle provided twice an hour and, there is also a free shuttle to the airport and/or the car hire centre, to meet travellers' demands.We would not hesitate to use this hotel again."
44,367,"Aug 11 2007 	Great location	Our family stayed at this Hotel not having been to Las Vegas previously. The Hotel is 4 minutes from Mandalay Bay and is reached via the free shuttle running every 30 minutes until midnight. A taxi fare is approximately 8 USD.The staff at the Hotel were amongst the best I have ever experienced in both attitude and service. Particulary Brian and Brett on the front desk and the two regular drivers another Brian and Pierre.The free breakfast was basic but sufficent and free tea and coffee all day. There are additional vending machines for drinks and snacks. Note there is no restaurant at the Hotel but you can easily order food in. The pool is not special but very nice and is often empty and feels like your own pool, plenty of clean towels provided.On the strip if you need transport take the Deuce bus but if you are in a hurry you better just walk as it was so slow. Recommend you visit the half price ticket booths for shows saving a fortune. Sky diving was fantastic with Sin city and worth the money as is the Dolphin habitat at the Mirage.Would definately recommend the Hotel and is close to the strip for the action but also far enough away for a rest. When we go back we will stay at this Hotel which is child friendly."
45,367,"Aug 10 2007 	Excellent!!	This hotel proved to be the perfect stop over hotel for us in Vegas before we started our tour of Utah and Arizona. The rooms were spotlessly clean and extremely spacious. The beds and pillows, in particular, were very comfortable after our long haul flight from the UK. The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals, bagels, pastries, etc. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We did not use the pool so I cannot comment. We would definately stay here again and I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good value hotel which is near too, but not located directly on the Strip."
46,367,Aug 4 2007 	Great Hotel/Great Value	The location is excellent. Internet is free. Don't expect to walk to anything as it isn't on the strip. But they do have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay. The rooms were clean. The maids very nice. This hotel is a good value at any price around 100 Dollars. Negotiate! The pool was/is nice and uncrowded - The breakfast is good. I will use this property again.
47,367,"Aug 1 2007 	Nice Clean Hotel	We arrived on July 29 for 3 nights. We found the hotel to be just what a hotel should be. Clean and comfortable. The staff were fantastic especially Brian, who supplied us with bottled water when the vending machine was empty and even baked cookies and supplied a cold glass of milk for our daughter one night! I have to say, that was above and beyond what we expected.The rooms are spotless, as said in other reviews and I am really fussy. The walls are really thin though. I heard in detail (through the wall) from some guys in the next room, all about their &quot;show&quot; experience. I am glad that they didn't wake my daughter up! However, someone must have complained about the noise, as the staff were up quite promptly to sort out the problem.The pool is quite and clean and there is a safe relaxed atmosphere there.I see this as being a hotel for families with younger kids staying in Vegas and people on business. Our family would definitely stay again, but if my husband and I were in Vegas without our daughter, we would stay on the strip. The shuttle bus they put on there is great, but if we were there to gamble, I enjoy being able to easily walk back up to our room without the hassle of buses and taxies. We all definitely give this place a big thumbs up!"
48,367,"Jul 24 2007 	liked this hotel	enjoyed our stay here although we had some difficulty finding it as there are 2 roads called polaris avenue and we cruised up and down the wrong one. once we found it we were very happy with it. Nice room, good size, clean. We had a car so were happy with the location. Nice breakfast, not too busy, good price for Las Vegas, would stay again"
49,367,"Jul 20 2007	Very overrated taxi rides will cost you a fortune!	Stayed at the Mandalay Bay mdiweek until it got to expensive and booked this on Hotwire at $92.00, after seeing it had the 7th best customer satisfaction rating. First off, the person checking us in insisted on putting my 18 year old daughter and I in a king size bed with me because &quot;that was what Hotwire had us down for. She did not seem to understand that there was something quite wrong with that. After going over her head and having the great vibe of our vacation taken away, we managed to get two double beds. This hotel is fine for someone resting their weary head on a business trip, however it is not suitable for a vacation style hotel. The pool lacks any charm and the area is &quot;devegetated&quot;. For a few more bucks I would strongly suggest booking a better hotel. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere and any savings on the room will be eaten alive by taxi rides. I have been to Vegas over 100 times and this place is truly near the bottom. They do have free wireless which is nice and a small size workout room."
50,367,Jun 19 2007	Just one negative	I have to agree with most of the reviews. A nice property and the staff was just great. Especially keeping in mind that this is Las Vegas. I enjoyed not being in a casino hotel for this trip. The only negative for us was that the walls are thin. Noticable sound from the next room. Guest there seemed to think that you have to yell into a cell phone. Sound problems from other rooms is not typical for HIX
51,367,"Jun 13 2007 	VERY Clean Hotel	Not within walking distance to the Strip, but free shuttle. We had a rental car and parked for free at the hotels. Very easy in/out parking at hotels. Did notice that the buses on the Strip were always crowded, even on Mon./Tue. This is a VERY clean and newer hotel. I am very particular about a hotel being clean. I even look at caulking lines around toilet to make sure they are clean. Coffee maker and tea bags in room, along with blow dryer and ironing board. Bedding was great. You have a choice of firm or soft pillows. No frig or microwave(would have been nice). No ice machine on 2nd floor(which we were on). Did not hear any outside noise(not even the planes), but the floors are very thin. People above us came in around 3:45 AM and sounded like they opening and closing their dresser drawers over and over again and just walking around for about an hour. Even the A/C couldn't hum that out. Would get top floor next time. Lobby area was very clean, front office staff very friendly(Brian) and helpful. Good variety for breakfast. Entrance of hotel had a great variety of coupons and magazines with coupons. Someone earlier mentioned the neighborhood was shady around hotel. I did not find that to be the case at all. Not much to really do withing walking distance from hotel. But who needs that when you have the Strip. This hotel is closest to the bottom 1/2 of the Strip. Spent 2 days here and only completed 1/2 hotels on the Strip. Hotels are farther apart than they seem on the maps. Was there on a Monday and Tuesday and did not notice the lines to be long at all. Was still pretty busy during the night even though it was during the week. Was worred about all I've heard about people standing on the side of the street handing out mini flyers of 1/2 dressed women(they did that but were not pushy at all), but not one tried to hand them to us since we had small kids with us. Had the buffet at Terrible's and it lived up to it's name. Yuck!"
52,367,"Jun 3 2007 	Fantastic hotel	Stayed at this property for two nights during our month long road trip of California and Nevada and we were not disappointed. Charming friendly and very helpful front desk staff (all of them). Fabulous room, large, extremely clean and with lovely new fresh white bedding (you can buy this online after you leave). Perfectly adequate free breakfast.We asked for a room overlooking the strip on a high floor (about 1 mile away) as suggested by a previous reviewer. These are to the front of the hotel and we were surprised as to how close the strip seemed (great pictures taken at night) but without the incessant noise and hustle and bustle. Be warned however, there is a building plot directly in front of the hotel and once built on will obliterate this view completely. Building works next door but no noise heard at all. All in all a wonderful experience and we would not hesitate to highly recommend this property and it's location."
53,367,"May 18 2007 	Stay Here! Excellent Hotel	Yes, I felt silly saying I was going to Vegas and staying at the Holiday Inn Express. But that faded away when we checked in. The staff was friendly and the service was impeccable. The room was clean, no hints of smoke ANYWHERE in the hotel. The pool was excellent, never crowded (we usually had it to ourselves). The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the hotel was quiet so we got lots of sleep (check other hotel reviews, you won't find that elsewhere). There was construction next door, but we never heard it while inside. Breakfast (FREE) was excellent, fresh warm cinnamon rolls, variety of juices, cereals, bagels, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt. The bathroom and the shower - excellent. We used the shuttle to the Mandalay Bay often, and again, were very impressed.I wanted to rest and relax at my hotel during my stay, and the Holiday Inn Express was PERFECT for that. I didn't want a &quot;party pool&quot; or a smoke filled hotel room just to say I stayed at one of the famous hotels. When I return to Vegas, I'll stay here again."
54,367,"May 15 2007 	Good value off-strip haven!	Stayed here at the end of April after flying in to Vegas from the UK. I wanted somewhere off strip so that the noise and madness was optional, and that's exactly what we got! I'd echo all the positive comments below about comfort, cleanliness, value etc and there's not much more i can add on that front. we stayed here two nights, then did a driving tour of California, then back to Vegas for two nights on the Strip, so can compare both options. In summary, i'd suggest this place is perfect for independent minded people who want to experience Vegas without the inconveniences of the big Strip hotels - lines for everything, hit and miss service, etc. Oh, and who don't mind at least one person not drinking at dinner so they can drive back, tho a cab is only $10 or so from the near end of the strip, and the HI do provide a shuttle bus option too.I heard no airplane noise either. Really don't know what's going on with that, unless the flight path changes based on wind direction or something.A few particular positives about this hotel, and i guess being off strip in general:- no long traffic queue to get to the hotel, no long walk from the car park, and no lines to check in. We could have been in our rooms within 10 minutes of picking up the rental car.- it's quiet - no drunken groups in the hallways at night, or shrieking cleaners in the hallways in the morning!- breakfast included - and by UK standards, a large and thorough breakfast! yes you might want to go pig out at a buffet afterwards, but it's nice to have the option of at least a quick coffee / snack first if you want a slower start to the day.- POOL &amp; hot tub were a big plus because there was never anyone in them! You'll never get any part of the pool to yourself in one of the big hotels. And, it was open until midnight if you fancied a dip before bed, which i love. Strip hotels tend to close their pools quite early, i guess to stop drunk people falling in them or something, i don't know!Only negative we found - aircon was pretty much on or off, and a bit noisy."
55,367,May 1 2007 	welcoming and helpfull staff	what a great hotel just a shame it is off strip! apart from that i couldnt fault it. it was clean the staff were very informative and the free breakfast was a good start to the day.we stayed for 3 nights and then were booked into the luxor for the rest of our stay if we had have known before booking how nice it was we would have probably not bothered with the luxor!!!(this is another reveiw i have to write but not good!!) the room was i good nice size clean smelling and the beds comfortable. we were on our 5th travel expedition to america and always like to wonder about and do our own thing without being bothered and the hotel was very helpful when we needed to get to somewhere but didnt bother us if we didnt need anything. the shuttle bus was helpfull if you wanted to get to the strip without driving.well done to all the staff for our pleasant stay we would certainly return and have told lots of friends about you.
56,367,"Apr 21 2007	A great hotel for the money!	I searched long and hard for an affordable but clean hotel for our three-night Vegas stay. Trip Advisor reviews were very helpful.  Our room at the Holiday Inn Express was squeaky clean. All amenities were as described. The beds were quite comfy despite my bad back! Staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the varied continental breakfast each AM and what a timesaver...no long lines at a casino breakfast buffet. Some reviews spoke of airport noise but the a/c fan drowned out any plane noise, which was sparse to begin with. We had the spa and pool to ourselves each evening. Parking was close and convenient and no lines at the front desk for check in. Sure, it's not on the strip, but only a short drive takes you there. We did not use the free shuttle to the Mandalay.  Quiet, clean, and just $109.00 per night (AARP price)...who could ask for anything more? A good birthday trip."
57,367,"Apr 20 2007 	Great place!	We are currently guests at the Holiday Inn Express On Polaris in Las Vegas. After having thoroughly read all the reviews for this hotel, I decided it sounded like a good deal to me. We were able to book this room with 25000 Priority Club points per night. We found the hotel very easy to get to from the car rental station at the airport. The whole hotel smells clean and fresh, and the beds here among the finest I have ever had at any hotel. Although the hotel is very airport handy, and others have written here complaining of airplane noise hindering their sleep, I can say that I never heard a plane fly over the entire 3 days we have been here. The Air conditioning units have a fan setting that allows you keep the fan running constantly ( heat or air) and that must act as white noise to cover the noise from the airport very well. The AC is a window type unit, but it is controlled by a thermostat on the wall. Always a plus staying at any HI Express is free continental breakfast and free in room wireless hi speed internet. Breakfast is identical of course to any HI Express. I am in room 324, and the view from my room includes several hotels on the strip ( from the backside) including the Bellagio. (My view also includes the interstate, so don't think I am saying it's just like staying on the strip!)We are in an &quot;executive&quot; room, which does have a small refrigerator and microwave and coffee maker, along with a sofa sleeper and coffee table. This the last night of my 3 night stay here, and I have slept like a baby the last two nights. The front desk staff has been very helpful in offering information about the hotel and the area, the shuttle to Mandalay Bay, and back routes to strip hotels during rush hour.It's just been a great place to stay, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean place to stay in Vegas, i you don't mind being a little bit away from the strip."
58,367,"Apr 18 2007 	Great Place to stay off the Strip	We stayed there following the good reviews on Trip Advisor, the location is very good if you dont want or need to stay on the Strip and much much cheaper! The front desk was efficient and helpful, the room spacious and clean(great fluffy towels) -super, comfortable beds. The complimentary breakfast was more than enough and of good quality and the cinnamon rolls....... well they are as good as they claim to be! A regular free shuttle to Mandalay Bay was a bonus - check it out"
59,367,Apr 9 2007 	Honey moon stay	This was not a bad place to stay the employees were very friendly and the rooms were clean. The rooms are a basic hotel room nothing fancy. They Have a free bus to Mandalay Bay and a free brakfast which will save you some money. We did have afew problems however. First off the employees were very nice but didnt know much about getting around or about Vegas second the pool was closed for some reason for about 3 days out of our stay so we had to go to another hotel and use there pool which wasent heated. They were also recharging there back up battery so the lights in our hall was out the one day. I havent made up my mind on satying off the strip yet. It is less busy and there are store where you don't have to pay a arm and a leg to get a drink or snack but the extra little trip to the strip seams like a pain some time and you don't quite get the magic feeling when your not on the strip. All and all I would stay here again but think it is a better place if youve been to Vegas afew times.
60,367,"Apr 8 2007 	Great - If you want to live at the end of a runway !	We booked this hotel because of all the great reviews on here about it ! What a mistake ! The hotel is nice, furnishings, clean etc...however WE COULD NOT SLEEP. The airport is about 5 blocks from the end of the Mccarran Airfield and there are planes taking off literally every minute all day and all night (less frequet at night but we counted 17 between midnight and 1am).Because it is so close to the airport there is so much noise from airplane engines. The pool is not a relaxing space because of the noise from planes constantly droning. If you want a relaxing hotel and the use of a pool avoid this hotel at all costs, true, it is great inside but the noise from plans ruins the whole place."
61,367,"Mar 18 2007	So airport handyI couldn't sleep	Very clean room, but no mini fridge or microwave. Pool well located for tanning all day. Pool and hot tub temperatures were very good. The bfst was excellent in variety with cinnamon buns, muffins, bagels, oj and excellent coffee etc.  There was no noise from other rooms, The window air conditioning was 1 high speed but it didn't drown out the airplane noise which was continuous all nite. The schuttle to the Mandalay was handy but the food there was very expensive--$60 for a boil in a bag dinner for 2.It was 90 degrees outside but they still didn't allow shorts in the lounge. snobs?"
62,367,"Mar 6 2007 	Good  but..	Having stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Detroit and Solvang, California, I knew that the one in Las Vegas would be a pretty safe bet. But I must say I'm a bit surprised that Tripadvisor members rate this as the 3. best hotel/value in Vegas. The rooms are perfectly fine, and the staff is friendly and efficent. I agree with most of the positive comments about the hotel, but here's why I can't give this hotel more than three points:1. Some advisors say that the noise from the airport isn't that loud. All I can say is that that depends on in whitch direction the planes are taking off. If they take off over the hotel the noise is quite bothersome.2. The AC - at least in my room - was very loud.3. In a time when many budget hotels in Vegas offer 42&quot; flat screen TVs, HIE still has old school TV's. And the reseption on mine was pretty bad on several channels. 4. The location. I desided to stay at this hotel because I wanted to stay off the Strip. But the area is dull, you can't walk to the strip, so you do need a car. Unless you want to spend money on taxis, or wait around for the shutle that runs to Mandaly Bay every half hour until midnight that is. 5. The price is good, but not great, compared to other great off strip deals like The Orleans or South Point. However there is one thing the others can't beat HIE on - the beds. I'm a regular visitor to Las Vegas and have stayed at more than 10 different hotels. Only at Paris have I been as comfortable in bed as I was here. And a room at Paris cost twice as much.The Holiday Inn Express is a safe bet for an off strip hotel. But be aware that everything is not as perfect as some advisors seems to think. Have a nice trip to Vegas - and good luck."
63,367,"Feb 28 2007 	A great value	What a surprise! This is a well run, nicely equipped with upscale furnishings establishment. Honestly expected this to be quite basic -but excellent service combined with no casino and lovely interiors will bring me back next time I'm in Las Vegas."
64,367,Feb 20 2007 	Excellent hotel	Stayed at this hotel 13-17 Feb 2007. Was very clean and in very good condition (newer hotel). Staff at front desk very helpful. The breakfast was very good. Easy to get to the strip as the free shuttle left every half hour to the Mandalay Bay. You can also catch the shuttle back to the hotel from the Mandalay Bay but make sure you wait for it on the lower valet level where the shuttle sign is. Safe area to do your morning run if you are a runner as it is located in a nice commercial area. Booked this hotel by reading all the previous reviews and was not disappointed. The reviews are right on. Pool is very good and hot tub very nice. See pics in this review. Very good value for the money.
65,367,"Feb 15 2007 	Fantastic place to stay - don't miss this bargain in Las Vegas	As with other reviewers I have to say that this hotel was one of the best places we have stayed in a long while. Last time we were in Vegas in Oct 2005 we stayed at the Luxor which we enjoyed but for value for money the Holiday Inn Express wins hands down. The beds were so comfortable, I wanted to take ours home with us!! The cleanliness of our room and the rest of the hotel was brilliant and we had a great stay here (3 nights in February 2007). We only had one slight glitch with our room keys but it was nothing major at all. We made use of the free shuttle to Mandalay Bay quite a lot and then got the tram up to Excalibur. If you time things well, it doesn't take much out of your day and in any case, you can spend a lot of time walking through casinos to get out of the bigger hotels.If we go back to Vegas we would stay here again."
66,367,"Feb 10 2007 	Good value close to the strip	I was attending a conference in Las Vegas. I could not get the group rate for the Mandalay Bay and their best public rate was more than double the rate for the Holiday Inn. The Mandalay does not include HIE free breakfast or the free internet access (there is wireless in the rooms and a PC and free printer in the lobby). I have stayed at several Holiday Inn Express hotels and the formula is pretty similar, but this one was by far the nicest. The beds and pillows (choice of hard or soft) had been upgraded and were a dream to sleep on. The rooms look almost new and bathroom, shower etc were in great condition. The holiday inn continent breakfast is typically a bit limited, but here they had a better choice with Yogurt and fresh fruit. There was a free shuttle every 30 mins to the Mandalay bay (which is just the other side of the freeway - 5 mins) and it you have plenty of time you can take the free shuttle train from Mandalay to Excalaber then walk from Excalaber to the MGM and then catch the monorail into town ($5 single, $15 all day). The location is really the only downside of this hotel if you want to be able to walk out of your hotel onto the strip then this isn't the place for you. If you have car or take the shuttle described above then just look at how much you will save. None of my friends were impressed with their rooms (mostly at the Mandalay bay) - at the price they paid they all complained about taking 15 mins to walk through the casino to get from their room to the car park and rooms which were tired and even dirty. The other great feature of the holiday inn is the pool/spa. Even in Feb it was warm enough for swimming the in outdoor heated pool and the spa was great."
67,367,"Jan 22 2007 	Secret off the Strip!	I stayed 2 nights at Luxor then 3 nights here. A free stay as I transferred Amex points to Holidays Inn's Priority Club Rewards Points. (I would have paid the going rate here) This hotel is less than 5 minutes from the strip. NO Valet as parking is right outside the doors. NO long walks to rooms. I was in room 322 directly across from the elevators and heard nothing. I had an executive suite with a mini fridge, coffee pot and microwave. Bathroom was nice........extended shower curtain and and a &quot;rain drop&quot; showerhead. Beds were like sleeping on clouds. Very, very comfortable. Duvets with 4 pillows. Bedding was top notch. You can request soft or firm pillows. FREE internet access in lobby. Free continental breakfast and a newspaper. 5 minutes after we checked in our room, the front desk called to see if we needed anything and if the room was up to our liking. (Nice classy touch....Thank you management.) Having done the strip hotels numerous times.........we will definetly be back. They also have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay twice an hour.........And on the 2nd floor is a laundry room. Nice touch considering I hate the smell of smoke and it was nice to wash everything before packing to go home. It was a nice switch from walking through chimney smelling casinos. Front desk always smiling and ask if you need anything.................Can't say enough about my stay here..........except it was great!!!!!"
68,367,"Jan 2 2007 	A good stay	This is a newish hotel, and the dcor is clean and bright. The staff are all very courteous and helpful. We had never been to Las Vegas and didn't really want to stay on the strip. This hotel is a good alternative - it's just on the other side of the interstate, but there is a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay resort which runs on the half hour and works well; from Mandalay Bay you can catch the free tram to the Excalibur, walk across the road to MGM Grand and the monorail and head up the strip. You can walk to most spots from the monorail stations. The noise from adjoining rooms was noticeable, but not bad. When the iron in our room didnt work, a new one was provided within minutes. It's probably time that hotels like HIE stopped using disposal plates and cutlery for their breakfast though; it's wasteful and probably irresponsible in this era of environmental awareness."
69,367,"Dec 30 2006 	This place is awesome!	I can't believe I would say that about a Holiday Inn, but this is the first time I've stayed in a HI Express, and I was very impressed. I've travelled quite a lot in the past year, and this was the newest, cleanest and most comfortable room that I've had, no questions. This hotel is still new, only about 3 years old, and is in very good condition. My husband and I stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday, and even at such a busy time the pool was empty and the breakfast room always had seats available. This seems like a small thing to be grateful for, but majority of the times I stay at a hotel with free breakfast the room is so crowded that there is no place to eat, and I often skip it altogether. My extended family stayed at the Flamingo, and for the same nightly rate I got free internet and free breakfast without having to walk through a smoky casino, so I think I got the better deal."
70,367,"Dec 20 2006 	An oasis just off the strip	My recent experiences at this place match those of many of the others who have commented about this place. It is a nice, quiet hotel off of the hustle and bustle that is the Strip. My stay was from Dec 16 - Dec 19.The good:- Decent location. Off of the strip, so it's actually quiet and a welcome retreat off the Strip. Easy to get to from the airport, and easy to catch I-15/215 to access the other parts of the city-Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay. Ran roughly :10 and :40 past the hour most of the time I was there. Operated from 7am to 11pm, so late night excursions are limited. Taxi's are a better option for late night, but for morning and afternoon excursions, the shuttle works well.-Helpful, curtious staff. They went out of their way to make sure I was being served well. No real complaints hereThe not so great:-Did wish the breakfast bar was a little more robust. It's an okay way to start out the day and probably will tide most people over til they can hit the buffets at the casinos, but I'm a little picky. -One pc in the lobby. Did wish they had another, since it was busy most of the time I tried to use it. If you have a notebook PC with a wireless card (or even if you don't have a wireless card) they encourage you to use that option by giving you access infomation @ checkin. Will be considering that option next time I stay there.I would stay there again, when I do make it back to Vegas. It's definitely a great place to stay."
71,367,"Nov 19 2006 	After a lot of searching we made the right choice !	Demographic: Middle aged, middle class husband and wife, looking for a good *value* for our accommodation dollars.I have a lengthy review below because I like to read indepth reviews. For those of you who are here to skim, heres the money shot - Book a room there, now!So, we were going to Vegas for the first time. We are simple Midwestern folk who live a normal, middle class life. Live in a modest home, couple of kids, dog and cat. We wanted to stay in a clean, nice place where we would feel safe.I searched, literally, for over 40 hours before settling on this property. The reason I didnt find it sooner was because for some unknown, unfair reason it was rated as a 2 star property (users rated it 4-5 stars). In reality it is at least a 4 star in my opinion. Details follow below.Firstly, we booked through the hotels web site about a month and a half in advance. We paid $96 a night for a Mon-Friday stay.After finding out the hard way that Polaris Street is not continuous and we were on the wrong side of the break, a call to the hotel yielded the needed directions to rescue us.Upon arrival we were greeted with a nice, clean, orderly looking outside of the hotel. So far so good. Going inside we were welcomed by a very nice gal who was courteous and helpful. I requested a strip view room, but she already had us in one facing the strip. Things were going well.Up to the second floor and opening the door revealed a nice clean smelling room. (All rooms are NON smoking!! They have a $250 charge for anyone who defiles the room with smoke. Good for them, I apologize if you smoke, but we who dont are sickened by stale cigarette smoke smell, ugh)The bathroom was spotless and the rest of the room didnt show any appreciable wear and tear beyond a cracked wall socket plate. Holiday Inn Express (HIE) makes a big deal about the bedding setup. We chose a King bed and it was comfortable, has 3 pillows (2 soft and 2 firm) and some fancy sheets and stuff (Who knows, Im a guy so not real important to me)The towels were kick a**. Very nice and fluffy.One of the primary reasons I chose this property was the FREE in-room high-speed Internet Access. I am a computer geek, but frankly, my dad could have set it up, it was that easy. The access speed was adequate at 750Kbs. There is also a complimentary computer and laser printer in the lobby if one does not carry a laptop.A FREE breakfast bar is available from 6:30 - 9:30 (If I remember correctly). Cinnamon rolls were very good. They also had a ton of other eats and drinks: Cereal, bagels, toast, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, OJ, milk, coffee, etc.We interacted with the staff a few times and each time was outstanding. One word of warning, the wake up call service they use was running 7 minutes or so behind and the first morning did not call at all. There is an alarm clock in the rooms so it is not that big of deal, but since I have been gushing I thought I would mention the one little flaw I found.The location of the hotel is off strip somewhat. You *could* walk it, but it would be a jaunt for sure. We rented a car from Alamo (very good experience there also) and just drove over since there are 100 locations to park for free once you get there.The first night we took the hotel sponsored shuttle. It is free, but be advised it only runs until 11:00, so for most people that will be way too early. The other issue is it only drops off at the Mandalay Bay which is severe south strip. It is a *long, long* way to the other end. The first night we walked until we were about to fall over. The next day we found we had made it just about 1/3 of the way up the strip. I forget to mention they also provide a free USA Today for those who want it.So, to close, we were extremely happy with this hotel and would absolutely stay here again. It may be rated by Expedia as 2 stars, but it is much nicer than that. Since it is a small property, the service the staff provides is more like the Midwest service we are used to back home.One last thought, if you go to Vegas you *have* to eat at the Rios seafood buffet. OMG, all you can eat lobster. I was such a pig, but my God it was great! (Hint: Get a fun book from Harrahs. It has a $10 per person coupon for the buffet (Which is $35 a head normally) and they will shuttle you from the Harrah to the Rio for free.Also, if you find this review helpful or just want to ask me a question, feel free to contact me at: tomrakers@programmer.netCheers!"
72,367,"Nov 3 2006 	Clean Convenient and Very Nice!	We only spent one night in Vegas before we headed to the Grand Canyon and northern Arizona. It was a great hotel at a fantastic price. We got a huge discount by paying in advance through their website. There was a wonderful free breakfast: hard boiled eggs, cereal, bagels, waffles, yogurt, juice, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. The rooms were very modern and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. It reminded me of the &quot;Heavenly Beds&quot; that are advertised at Westins. The shower was wonderful. The view was a nice panorama of the strip. It was convenient to the strip without all of the hassles of the strip. Overall, the best hotel I've stayed in for a few years."
73,367,"Oct 24 2006	Recommended	Well placed about 1/3 mile off the Strip, so convenient but more quiet. There was a Police Dog Convention while we were there, so we felt it was very secure! Beds confortable. Room/bathroom very clean. There is a shuttle bus to the strip if you should wish. Would be 5/5 but the breakfast was not as good as some of the places we stayed. That said, we would recommend this Hotel. Took a flight to the Grand Canyon which was fab. One tip - go for a tour which gives you extended time at the Canyon as most only give you an hour or two to soak in the enormity of the place - not nearly enough."
74,367,"Oct 19 2006 	Perfect spot	This was the first hotel that we stayed in on our 4 week driving trip around the west coast. The room was clean and was big enough for the 6 of us. The location was great, we drove to the strip self parked for free without any problems and explored. We left the strip of an evening and went shopping and had dinner off the strip. We left the hotel for one night to go to the Grand Canyon and left our things in the room without any problems. The breakfast was self service and was a great light healthy start to the day. I am so glad that we didn't stay on the strip but stayed here. The children got to see Vegas but were away from the strip at night."
75,367,"Sep 9 2006 	We'll be back!	I took a gamble on this location, and it was the best bet I made in Vegas! My husband had a 3-day seminar at the Mandalay Bay in early September, and after seeing all the good reviews on this site, I decided to take a chance and stay here, saving $50 per night off the &quot;special seminar rate&quot; at the Mandalay. WHAT A GREAT CHOICE. The rooms are spotless and comfortable, relatively quiet (especially being this close to the airport), and the bathrooms are hospital-clean. Free continental breakfast, free wireless internet (huge for us), super-helpful front desk staff, and a free shuttle every 30 minutes to the Mandalay. Great pool and hot tub--and unlike some of the trendier places on the strip, no fighting for chairs! A huge bonus for us is that you don't have to wander around in a smoke-filled casino for 20 minutes to get out of the building, or down to the pool. It is away from the action, yet close enough to be in the middle of it within 15 minutes. If you aren't in Vegas for the gambling (or want to get away from it when you are finished), you won't regret the Holiday Inn Express!"
76,367,"Sep 5 2006 	Great one night stay	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express for one night the first part of September. Check-in was very smooth and the desk staff was very professional. When we got back to our room following some time at a local casino, they'd left a message making sure that everything was meeting our needs.The room was wonderful! Very comfortable beds and pillows. I couldn't decide which I liked more -- the bed or the shower, which was also great. The breakfast bar met our expectations. Several different kinds of muffins/bagels/frozen waffles/pastries, along with fruit, coffee, juices and cereal. We would definitely stay here again, and will also be looking for other Holiday Inn Express hotels for our future travel plans."
77,367,"Aug 31 2006	Nice Hotel - Would stay again	Spent a three day weekend at the Holiday Inn Express. Very clean rooms and pleasent staff. Very quiet and the bed/pillows rocked. A/C was perfect. Holiday Inn Express is becoming my favorite place to stay everywhere. The shuttle to the Mandalay Bay saved a $8 cab fare. From the Bay, you can take tram to the Excalibur and then take the Monorail from the MGM all the way to the Stratosphere. Very easy and you save some dough for cab fares. Ask the shuttle driver the day you have to go to the airport to see if they can take you. Most likely they will and its free! Only bad thing was that a vending machine at the hotel took my money. Certainly not a big deal in Vegas compared to what the slots took."
78,367,"Aug 23 2006 	Clean 'Near Strip' Alternative	Holiday Inn Express, Russell Road at Polaris Avenue, Las Vegas. Relatively new, clean, non-casino property. Rooms were very comfortable- with the &quot;new&quot; HI Express bedding and linens. Breakfast was more than adequate- juices, eggs, muffins,cereal,biscuits &amp; gravy, fruit, yogurt, etc. A hotel shuttle will transport you to/from Mandalay Bay. You're within eyeshot of many of the south strip casinos. Convenient to McCarren Airport via freeway- take &quot;airport tunnel&quot; to I-15North, then exit left at Russell Road. There are two all night convenience stores / gas stations a few steps away, as well as a Colonial Bank ATM. We discovered the studio/warehouse for Magician David Coppefield across the street-you'll see the many touring trailers parked. Not much else in walking distance of this hotel complex, except a &quot;Gentlemen's Club.&quot; The pool and jacuzzi were sparkling clean, with nice nighttime views of the Strip lights. Oh, if you really wanted to walk to Mandalay Bay- you could probably make it in appx 25-30 minutes on a pedestrian sidewalk, but you'll have to cross a freeway entrance and exit. Complimentary computer kiosk/printer just off lobby."
79,367,"Aug 16 2006	Perfect	After spending 2 nights on the Strip, we needed a cheaper hotel to spend our last night before our flight home. Having read the reviews on Trip Advisor I went ahead and booked a room for my family - 2 adults &amp; 2 teenagers. Very spacious, modern, clean and well equiped room. Complimentary continental breakfast, internet access and shuttle to the strip. The staff were very friendly and helpful, offering local info - even though we were only there for one night. The kids loved the pool and hot tub - again this area was spotlessly clean and tidy - nice shower area and toilet facilities. The only drawback was construction in the area - much like the rest of Vegas at the moment!! - but this didn't cause us any problems. I would highly recommend this hotel - if you aren't bothered about staying on the Strip (having done so for the first 2 nights - it's not all it is cracked up to be) - this hotel is perfect - the complementary shuttle service gets you to the strip - about 5 mins drive away. You can then hop on the deuce bus at $5 for the day - you can just hop on and off where and when ever you chose - This hotel was also 10 mins from the airport - but plane noise was not a problem."
80,367,"Aug 15 2006 	Good location good front desk butpoor housekeeping.	Let's start saying that this hotel, even if not directly on the strip, has an optimal location. If you can move with your own (or rented) car, the strip is 5 minutes far.The swimming pool is good and not very busy.The breakfast is almost the same you can find in any other holiday express hotel. Talking about bad things, we've been very unlucky with housekeeping service: during our four days stay we found our room undone after 2.00pm for three consecutive days. The last day, our room was still undone at 3.40pm!Said that, we found our rooms always very clean.Overall, the front desk service is good, but housekeeping organization needs strong improvements."
81,367,"Aug 14 2006	Good alternative to strip	Stayed here for one night in August. Nice, clean room with new bed linens and showerhead. This is a good alternative to staying on the strip. Less expensive and easy to drive to any casino on strip. All the casinos have free self parking so you can leave your car and walk up and down the strip then drive back to hotel when done. Free wireless internet and continental breakfast are plusses. Only negative was loud group in hallway in middle of night, but it is Las Vegas so I guess you have to expect that. 5 minute drive to airport. They have a shuttle to Mandalay Bay but we had car so did not use that. No restaurants within walking distance(at least none that I could see)."
82,367,"Jul 18 2006	G8t Hotel good value	I stayed here with my wife and 2 kids 17 &amp; 11 - we had a 2 bed room and it was fantastic - very clean - large and very comfortable. Swimming pool was also very handy and clean, also not very busy. We got the free bus from hotel to the Mandalay which ran every 30 min. we stayed all day - night at the strip with loads to do and got a taxi back which costs about $10. We then sat at the hot tum to bathe our feet. Go stay there it really was very good! Oh! breakfast was also super! continetal style"
83,367,"Jul 16 2006	Hotel great-Unfortunately service poor	First off, our reservation information was not readily retrieved from the front desk person. When things were finally sorted out (we thought) we checked into our room, which turned out to be a smoking room (we wanted NON) that totally stunk....as did the entire floor! Because we had a show to get to quickly, we couldn't do much other than call the front desk and ask what happened to the non-smoking room we reserved. Basically the question was met with a disinterested comment about the room not being available, and would we like the room to be &quot;sprayed again&quot;. On a positive note, the beds and bedding in the rooms are very nice, and the breakfast bar and staff running it were top knotch. Back to the bad stuff.....the following day I complained to a new front desk person about how bad the room smelled and interestingly she was able to move us. It was a bit of an inconvienience, but the new room was much fresher. We had a big bag of dirty laundry to do that day, so I figured I would put a load in and then watch the kids at the pool.....after bringing the bag to the laundry room, I noticed that there wasnt supplies available...so went to the front desk. They apparently ran out of guest laundry supplies....I was told there was a store nearby to get what I needed if I wanted. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. The next day, I called the front desk to see if they had obtained any laundry supplies yet....I was told &quot;yes&quot; and that someone would run it up to our room. Well, after a half hour of waiting, I called the front desk and got a different guy who said there were NO supplies after all! The other downside of this hotel was the location, and the limited shuttle service to the strip (only drop off and pick up is at Mandalay Bay). I guess if you don't want to spend much time on the strip, then location isn't much of a factor.The bottom line for us is the poor service we received....primarily from the front desk staff. For that reason alone, we likely would not return to this hotel."
84,367,"Jul 15 2006	Great family holiday	We stayed here for four nights on a trip to the USA, we are used to staying in five star accommodation and only stayed here after such great reccommendations on Trip Finder and we were not disappointed! The hotel is clean, quiet and comfortable and our family room comfortably accomidated our family of six! The staff were friendly and helpful and staying off strip was a great decision. We had a ball in Las Vegas and will stay here again in a heartbeat!"
85,367,"Jul 6 2006	Always Very Nice	We love this hotel. It is always extremely clean and fairly quiet, if you can deal with the sound of airplanes nearby (which is blocked pretty well when the air conditioner runs). The bathroom is large, with a massive granite counter inside and a hot shower with excellent pressure. The breakfast selection is great and convenient, as in the computer in the lobby with internet access. The shuttle is hit or miss and they're working on that problem by having it now only drop off and pick up at the Mandalay Bay. They also have brand new linens with a top sheet-covered down comforter and a choice of either soft or firm pillows on every bed. We'll stay again!"
86,367,"Jul 4 2006	Great Hotel for the entire family!	This may be considered a &quot;budget&quot; hotel but we were treated like royalty.Their beds were AMAZING!! Apparently it's their new line of beds, linens, soaps, shampoos...whatever it was it was GREAT! We came from a dump of a hotel the night previous and this was such a refreshing change.I'm not kidding, we have a nice bed at home but I would trade mine at home for the bed in this hotel. I could have spent the entire vacation there.The hotel was super clean, breakfast was great. They even gave us hot out of the oven cookies that evening.The pool was nice and definitely needed in the Nevada heat!AND...they have a free shuttle to Mandalay Bay to the tram until 11:00pm each night.I would stay there again and again!!"
87,367,"Jun 7 2006	Top Value; don't bother staying on the strip!	Just back from two weeks in California, driving from San Fran to Las Vegas and back. Most nights we stayed in Holiday Inns or Express because we had reward points. It was interesting to see how they varied when on the face of it they are the same. This one was best of the bunch; the fresh clean smell in the corridors made a good impression before we even saw the room. Warm cinnamon rolls for breakfast was a nice touch not found elsewhere.The pool was the best of all the places we stayed and the rooms were quiet. The only minor problem was aircraft noise; it's right under the glide path. We were surprised that the windows were not double glazed; the London Heathrow equivalent felt like they were landng on the roof but there was no sound of them inside. The airport seems to close around midnight and open at 7.00ish so it didn't disrupt our sleep.Beware of the free shuttle to the strip! We thought we'd take a break from the driving but jt arrived 10 minutes late and already full. The driver claimed there would be another along in 15 minutes so we sat down outside, only to find a few minutes later a queue outside of at least a shuttle full. It still hadn't arrived to pick them up when we left in the car 25 minutes later.Parking is free in all the big hotels, so once you've worked out how to get outside onto the strip you've got it made. It's about 10 minutes drive to the Paris which was the easiest to park and exit."
88,367,"Jun 6 2006	Nice place	Should you listen to me? I'm someone who usually stays in a modest hotel - Hampton, Fairfield, Holiday Inn. Will do a Ramada or Hilton on occasion. A Lodge or resort/spa is a treat for me. Mostly I want a CLEAN ROOM and I prefer a new hotel or a recently renovated one.I didn't get to use this hotel like most might. Checked in at 6pm and was gone by 4am. Room was immaculant. Very clean, nicely decorated. Bed was a bit soft but they had option of pillows (firm and soft) and the bedding was first rate.The staff was friendly and very capable. The provided great directions to eat dinner - something simple - Chillii's. The drive to the airport was very simple, about 3 turns and there you are.The only negative thing I can say about it was that it doesn't have an airport shuttle. I wanted that and mistakenly thought they did - but that is my fault. Otherwise, very clean, nice lobby, quick elevators, helpful staff, no problems.I'd stay again."
89,367,"Jun 4 2006	Very clean	My husband and I were on our way from Florida to the Grand Canyon via Las Vegas. We really just needed a room for the night before starting our drive to the Grand Canyon. I chose the Holiday Inn Express on Polaris because I had never been to Las Vegas before and I wasn't sure about staying right on the strip. Las Vegas honestly isn't really my idea of a vacation destination. Holiday Inn Express was very clean. Our room was nice and comfortable. Breakfast the next morning had all the basic necessities and was great. They kept the area well stocked and clean. The hotel is very close to the strip, which, yes we did go to for a few hours. It is a very easy drive, I think we only made two quick, easy turns to get there. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
90,367,"May 10 2006	Pleased again..	My second stay at HI Express was virtually the same:PROS: 1. Terrific Value- $120 on weekends2. Great Shower- rainfall showerhead, curved curtain for more space, great water pressure.3. Good FREE Breakfast. Coffee complimentary anytime. Free internet in Lobby and WIFI in room.4. 30 Secs Max from Entrance to RoomCON:1. Shuttle continues to be overcrowded (weekends). Plan on a backup taxi ride of about $7 to South side of strip. Don' t count on shuttle to make dinner or show reservations- plan ahead and reserve a limo or call a taxi!"
91,367,"Apr 11 2006	Very nice hotel	We were very pleased with our one night stay at this hotel. It's off the strip, just west of I-15, but within 2 minutes drive of the MGM, Mandalay Bay, etc. Price was much cheaper than the strip hotels and it included an excellent breakfast with everything you need to start the day off on the right foot. It was really nice not having to walk a mile to get to your room like you do with most of the big strip hotels.The hotel offered shuttles to the strip, though we didn't use this service so I can't comment.The only negative experience we had at this hotel was the construction going on next door on the freeway side of the hotel. They even worked on weekends which surprised us. But it wasn't that loud, just the occasional back up sounds from the tractors and cranes. A room on the western side of the hotel might alleviate this concern if absolute peace and quiet is required. Otherwise, it really wasn't that big a deal for us."
92,367,"Mar 13 2006	Great off-strip hotel	I agree with just about everything the last couple of reviewers have written. This is a great choice for your budget, especially on a weekend. The room was very clean and comfortable, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Wireless internet connection in the room worked perfectly, and there is a computer in the lobby with a printer. I arrived at 11am on a Saturday and was able to check in early with no trouble. The breakfast bar is great and they have lots of seating, including a sofa in front of a fireplace.The one small complaint is about the free shuttle that goes to the Bellagio and Mandalay Bay. It's very popular and has to deal with traffic, so it's rarely on time and is sometimes full when it does come. Still no seating outdoors for waiting outside, but you can wait in the lobby and the driver will come in and announce that the shuttle is there. If you're not in a hurry, the shuttle is a nice convenience.If you don't want to wait, the front desk is great about calling a cab for you, and we paid $8 to get to the strip. The cab to the airport was $12. Plan on the expense of a cab to and from the airport if you aren't driving, because none of the airport shuttles come to this hotel.The value, quality and service this hotel provides more than make up for the transportation issues. I'd definitely stay here again."
93,367,"Feb 12 2006	just the place at half the cost	my husband and I stayed here in january 2006 we had a great stay here, the hotel was very clean and the staff could not have been more helpful, however the only blot on the copy book was that the courtesy shuttle was'nt very good at arriving on time anything from 30-45 mins late.also they could have done with a seat/seating outside for guests that were waiting. but despite this it was well worth its money and we would happily stay there again next time."
94,367,"Jan 4 2006	Great Find	Was sceptial about booking this after being on Strip for 4 nights but needed a bed for the night.This hotel was fantastic, we got upgraded to a suite, Make sure you ask for suite 422 if paying as this is the only suite with a view of the strip.Room spacious and lovely, swimming pool open even though it was December and also laundry facilities on the 2nd floor. There was also tea/coffee maker in the room.Service was very efficient and polite, nothing was too much trouble.There was a curtesy bus that dropped off/picked up at the Bellagio every 1/2 hour from 7am to 11pm which we used as was better than staying on the strip as it was dead central.Would stay here again, without doubt."
95,367,"Jan 1 2006	Loved it!!	My husband, my two sons and myself stayed here for two nights in December 2005 and was very pleased. We didn't go to Las Vegas to gamble, we just wanted to see the Hoover Dam. The staff was wonderful, the rooms were so nice and clean. We got a good nights sleep because the beds were sooo comfortable, and the rooms were quiet. The continental breakfast was very good. They have a computer in the lobby you can use to check emails also, and have free USA Today newspapers. If we ever go to Las Vegas again, we would definitely stay here."
96,367,"Nov 28 2005	Great Value! Super clean rooms and tasty breakfast	I picked this hotel after I read the raving reviews and wasn't exactly sure why a Holiday Inn Express was much to rave about except for the price. With exception to the distance to the block (which you would either drive or take a shuttle), this hotel is one of the best value in Las Vegas. The rooms look clean and new, and the breakfast offered large selection and was included in the hotel room price. This is a great hotel at a budget price, much better than some of the hotels on the strip. The parking is free, so this hotel is more enjoyable if you had a car to drive to the strip."
97,367,"Oct 4 2005	An Excellent launch pad to the Strip!	We stayed here Sept. of 2005 and thought the hotel was great for the price. The hotel was clean and the room was excellent. We were unfortunately put next to room services storage room, but never noticed any noise. IMPORTANT NOTES: they have a free shuttle every 30 minutes to the Strip, but get there early. The shuttle is a joint operation between 3 hotels and at peak times, seating can be limited. BREAKFAST: it was ok, but I really went Vegas to eat at nice restaurants, but it was nice to get a cup of coffee and a bagel before we left each morning. The also have free internet at the hotel, which was very nice. I would recommend this hotel over the Strip Casinos any day."
98,367,"Sep 10 2005	Great Breakfast...Very Clean.....	Wonderful to wake up to an early Breakfast with EVERYTHING you can think of....including Cranberry Juice (mixes well with Vodka, says my husband)...WOW!!As a smoker though...Would have been nice to have chairs in the front, while we waited for our shuttle (arrives every 20 min.)I love the bedding (foam matteress) had a sound sleep.They even had hydraulic doors to every room, so that no door slams down the hallways. Let's not forget Holiday Inn's showers that are wide spread and the pressure was great.Laundry room was availiable to us as well, felt like home...HA!&quot;What was brought to Vegas.....Stayed in Vegas&quot;...$$$$$---0,000.00Bob and Mari Ann-Cartersville, Georgia.

109,367,Aug 28 2007 	tolle Adresse sich nach einem erlebnisreichen Tag auszuruhen
1,369,May 27 2007 	i was 4 days ago .. .... its fine ...	no its not the four star luxury of the major hotel casinos in vegas .. but i didnt pay three hundred dollars for a room i barely used anyways like i did the night before . i saw not a single bug .. and had the back window open all night and no garbage truck pulled up . this was on a monday night .. its an older motel but the room was clean .. the property kept up . the only thing i could see is in the hot summer the a /c unit may not be good enough .
2,369,"Mar 26 2006	No Sleep Here!!!!!	I picked this place after 30 hrs of driving time to Vegas. I was exhausted and you'd think I'd sleep like a log. NOT!!!! During the night 5 different dumpster trucks backed up to the dumpsters located behind the hotel. If you don't mind the &quot; beep, beep, beep&quot; of trucks backing up or the noise their hydraulics make lifting the bin ( the diesel engine also revs during this part ) or the noise they make when they bang the dumpster 5 times to make sure its empty then this may not bother you....however it drove me insane. Just as I would start to drift off ..yet another truck came by to empty the next bin.The guy at the front desk did not seem surprised regards my complaint and was short about the fact that he had no control of the situation.AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!!"
3,369,"Sep 11 2005	You get what you pay for . . .	This hotel was cheap, and on the Strip (northern Strip, right across from the Stratosphere) . . . but boy, was it seedy. It had a 24-hour pool, but you couldn't have paid me to go in! I killed two roaches during a two-day stay. If you're looking for a place that's on the strip and CHEAP, this place is it -- and it does have free parking -- but it's a pit, no two ways about it. My boyfriend wasn't as offended by the roaches and general seedy atmosphere, so perhaps if you're a group of guys going to Vegas and you're looking for nothing more than a cheap bed and shower so you can blow money at the tables, this might be your place. I do NOT recommend it for a romantic vacation. I felt a bit like a &quot;working girl&quot; after a couple nights in this place!"
4,369,Sep 23 2008 	Das Motel etwas lter jedoch sehr sauber und gnstig.
1,370,"Sep 30 2009 	Will never stay there again	Required to make copy of Drivers License and credit card when I made reservation.Few weeks later discovered that some was trying to use my i.d. with the copies made at the hotel. Fortunately the person was arrested before any charges were made on my card. When I contacted the management and told them what happened, there was no apology. Did not even offer to look into the matter."
2,370,"Aug 7 2009	Great place to stay in Las Vegas	We stayed at Homestead Suites in early June. I picked this property based on the reviews that I read on TripAdvisor. This hotel is great. First, the staff was very gracious. I had a few simple requests. We were traveling with a small dog and we also needed a roll-away bed. The front desk handled my requests perfectly. Our room was on the first floor, near the door. It was easy to take the dog out and we were close to our car. It was great to have a fully stocked kitchen. We were able to eat leftovers and have cold drinks in the fridge. The hotel was very well maintained, inside and out. It is a few blocks from the strip, close to stores, stations, etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveiing to Las Vegas. We'll definitely be back!!!"
3,370,"Jul 25 2009 	it's worth the value.	The only thing is the room, especially the rug, wasn't clean enough for us who has a crawling baby. The room was cozy and fairly close to the Strip. Actually, it's very close by private car, but two bus shift is necessary by public transportation."
4,370,"Jul 12 2009 	Great place to stay if looking for low price cleanliness and friendly staff	i stayed at Homestead for second time in two months (due to relative in hospital, then in therapy facility). it was much more reasonable than Strip hotels, had complete kitchen so that I did not have to eat out every meal. It is quiet and clean and i have always been made to feel welcome. The maids do not come every single day, as it IS an exended stay hotel, but how many times do you change your sheets in a week? IF one would want to hit the casinos or see shows, they are mere minutes away. There is a Denny's next door and that is very handy, as well.I am going back in two weeks and will stay there again, as it is perfect for someone one in Vegas for business or personal reasons."
5,370,Feb 2 2009	Dishonest Stressful	Had a nephew in a coma at Sunrise hospital. Needed a place for family to sleep in shifts. Everytime we talked to them the prices changed to a higher price. Finally agreed on a price and later found out they charged us $40 more than agreed upon. He agreed that he quoted us that price but couldn't do anything about it. He adjusted a litlle but not what we were promised. As we walked each room it took us 4 rooms to find one that could even be okay to stay in. The first one he showed us had poop in the toliet. The others were stinky and bedding not washed. It got to the point that it was ridiculous and moved to a different hotel. They were very dishonest and we felt like they were taking advantage of our situation needing to be close to the hospital. Very stressful
6,370,Nov 13 2008	Fantastic stay	The whole staff went out of their way to make my stay next to perfect!
7,370,Jun 26 2007 	They were Great !!!	I had to stay at this hotel for a surrogacy we transferred next door with Sher Inst. this hotel was awesome and the people there were so sweet. I highly recommend this hotel. I will be there again and praying for same luck as we had before. When the couple I am working with asked about a Hotel I told them about this one and how great they were. They booked rooms with NO issue what so ever.
8,370,"Nov 25 2006 	In Vegas! This is good for the money!	With weekend prices on the strip of $250 per night or more, the Homestead Studios Suites hotel is a blessing. I stayed here last weekend for a price of only $89 plus tax. It is my second stay at this hotel. It's location is about five blocks from the strip in an area where there is a hospital across the street and the UNLV two blocks away. Mainly business around with a smaller of amount of residences. It is an extended stay hotel for business travelers, contractors, agents, etc. Therefore there is no luxury, fancy suites, puffy drapes or concierge downstairs to wait on your every wish. It is a simple, clean, studio hotel with a kitchen and a bathroom. A rental car or taxi is required to get to the strip. The travel area between the hotel and the strip is not something I'd want to walk through at night, but perfectly cool in a car. On convention weekends this hotel can jump up pretty high (around $150 per day), but for regular weekends it is bargain. I do higly recommend it and will stay there again on my next visitThank you!GT"
9,370,Aug 21 2006 	Very Poor Guest Service	Hotel does not seem to know exactly what guest service means. The hotel manager Nur A is very arrogant and front desk clerk Rosa is not only rude but does not know what she is doing. It took us more than 20 minutes to check in and another 30 minutes to check out. Having a front desk who has been there for 6 weeks is not an excuse for a very poor guest service. Our complaints fell only into her deaf ears. When we checked in the manager was present at the front desk and seems to impress that he is busy doing something but actually he is not doing anything and was just looking at the poor front desk clerk do her job and not giving her any assistance even though other guests were waiting to check in.
10,370,"May 30 2005 	Excellent Experience!	I had originally checked on the reviews and thought &quot;Oh No!&quot; However, I had made my reservations and needed a place to stay for my two week training. What I experienced was a very polite, helpful staff, a very clean and efficient room, and lots of peace and quiet. Everything about my stay was excellent. The staff was always more than accomadating and I found the area to be very safe. I have stayed in Vegas &quot;Off Strip&quot; before and found it to be scary but this was great. I had great comfort in knowing that my vehicle was safe. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend!"
11,370,"May 1 2005	Avoid the Homestead	Please avoid this hotel, it was a disaster. Our business group was here for a convention and the room was booked for us on the Las Vegas end. We couldn't believe how disgusting the rooms were, and everything else in town was booked. There was no internet service, there was no maid service for an entire week, on a business trip! We had to buy towles at the mall it was THAT bad. The rooms were dirty, they smelled, and the air conditioning was broken for six days in Las Vegas!Everyone complained, the hotel was so subpar we couldn't even laugh about it. Our company terminated business with the travel agent who booked us there."
12,370,"May 1 2005 	Hated the Homestead	The absolute worst hotel I have ever been asked to stay in. I was here for business not pleasure and asked the business I was meeting with what was a quiet hotel nearby. This place was a waste of money, and a depressing place to return at the end of the day."
13,370,Sep 21 2003	Homestead	I stay in this hotel frequently for business and the management always is friendly. The location is convenient as it is near a mall and many restaurants.
1,371,Good choice off the strip	Stayed in a two bedroom suit with four adults total. Each room had its own bathroom. There were nice 32 flat screen TVS in each bedroom and one in the living room. Room were clean and looked nice and modern. Hotel staff was helpful and friendly. The free continental breakfast was good. Hotels location was good if you have a car. It is only about a Mile to the strip and there are a lot of choices for dinning and shopping within a mile of the hotel. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.
2,371,"Nov 20 2009 	Near the airport but not near the strip	If you want to be near the airport, this hotel works great. If you want to be near the strip and don't have a car, you'll be disappointed. For me, being near the airport was important, though as mentioned by someone else, Hidden Well Road is hidden well. Thank goodness for GPS. Once you know where it is, it's easy to get to and from. As with all Homewood Suites, the breakfast is good."
3,371,"Oct 18 2009 	This is the spot	October in Las Vegas was great  although the sun was still a bit strong, the temperature was perfect. We participated in an outdoor sporting event but we didnt combust in to ashes like we almost did in August (dont ask what we were thinking). When we checked in, there were two people working at the lobby hence processing two sets of guests at a time. I wasnt worried too much about the security issue since I was with two Chippendale types (ok, not exactly) but the staff who processed us (Brady, I think and I believe he is the manager) was alert/cautious/discreet enough not to read out and announce our room number when he gave us the room key there  I was very happy with the hotel from the get go because of that. It turned out Brady is a hardworking (and/or overworking) guy - he was there when we checked in, during our stay, and when we checked out. I hope he is getting paid well. He was doing a great job. We booked a non-smoking, 2 bedrooms/2 baths suite for 3 adults and 3 children. In our room, 245, 2 bedrooms were joined by a small kitchen/dining/living room. There is a full size refrigerator in the kitchen that we packed it with snacks and drinks. The room was also equipped with a coffee maker, a microwave oven and even a toaster, stove and dishwasher. This hotel is not a smoke free hotel but we werent bothered by any smoke smell at all. The room windows were at the freeway side and the traffic noise was a bit loud for me; but it was no issue for the rest of the group. The airport noise didnt bother us at all. The complimentary breakfast was great; it accommodated light to heavy eaters like fruit to burritos. The kitchen staff was efficient and they kept the food well stocked and countertops and tables clean. The swimming pool was heated and the children were very happy dipping in the early nippy morning. This hotel suited and satisfied our trip needs; price, amenity and location. If your Las Vegas stay is mainly non-gaming, this is the spot."
4,371,"Oct 8 2009 	Luxury at an affordable price	The property was spotless and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel was at the airport on Hidden Well Road. We got a laugh out of that because we had a time finding it at first, but it was near Walmart and other stores where basic necessities could be purchased. This hotel is the next best thing to home."
5,371,"Oct 7 2009 	Great Value!	This is a great airport hotel. It offer great value along with a super efficient free shuttle bus service to and from the airport along with Mandalay Bay. Our room was spacious and clean. The free breakfast in the morning was a pleasant suprise. There were eggs, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, &amp; toast (not your usual continental breakfast affair).The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airport hotel to anyone."
6,371,"Sep 29 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	Brand new hotel, off the strip but not so far, a plus that they have a shuttle that takes and picks you up from THE MANDALAY BAY. The room decor was really trendy and clean, and the bed was to die for. The kitchen was impressive for a room and had all that one needs.Quiet and spacious room. A yummy breakfast in the morning with good variety (However u have to wake up sorta early to get the best of the layout) Regular pool but very clean, and even though it is 5 min from the airport I slept like a babe and could not hear anything. Will be booking again whenever I go to Vegas again hands down!!!"
7,371,"Sep 1 2009 	Very close to the airport.	This hotel from what I understand is roughly one year old, the hotel seems very new. The hotel and the area are fairly quiet for the exception of the airport noise. Its located at the exit of the terminal of the aiport so a I imagine wouldnt cost much to get there. I'd like to stress that this hotel is NOT walking distance to anything other than the rental car center which would be about a 5 to 10 minute walk. They do have shuttle service, however it only takes you to mandalay bay and picks up there. Overall Id come back if I wanted value but not convience (not there fault)"
8,371,"Aug 31 2009 	Poor service bad iron burned blouse and empty promises	During a four-night stay at Homewood Suites Las Vegas, my room was not cleaned -- despite me asking on the third morning to have a thorough cleaning. There were crumbs on the floor, crumbs in the carpet, the toilet seat had the same spot on it for three days, the trash was not emptied, the shower had the same marks on them. I can understand not changing the sheets every day -- but not cleaning the bathroom, when clearly in need, is ridiculous! Especially, when I went to the front desk on the third morning, asking why the room wasn't clean. I was told they only do a thorough cleaning on check out or if requested. I requested it -- still not done. Then, the iron had something burned on it, and it burned a hole in my blouse that went to my favorite suit! The manager assured me herself that I would be reimbursed for the blouse, provided I send a receipt. I sent the receipt -- six weeks later, still not reimsbursement for my blouse. For a $56 blouse, they officially lost a customer. Exactly what is the value that is placed on keeping clients? I guess it's less than $56 -- my worth is offically $55 or less in their eyes. I used to be their biggest fan, staying at Homewood Suites wherever I could....Marriott here I come! If you weren't going to reimburse me for my blouse, don't lie about it! Several calls and conversations later with Jennifer, the manager, with excuses of the check's in the mail, the check must've gotten lost, and I have to stop payment on the first check -- is all lies!"
9,371,"Aug 23 2009 	I""ve Been Spoiled!!	OK...I loved this place!!!..Here is my review...Short and Sweet...I was traveling alone...leary of many things....I looked and looked and found this hotel online and after reading the reviews I thought I'd sleep on it and decide in the morning.....Well....I'm glad I did! This place had the most spotlessly clean and fresh smelling new rooms you could imagine...The bathroom was just like home...it was designed beautifully. The shower had a shower massage head that felt like a dream!... FULL FORCED WATER!....no little drips that you had to run under to catch and get aggravated with and when all was said and done it felt like you needed a shower!!!...It was a pleasure to fall sleep on a new beautiful clean king size bed!...just like home!...No smoke smell anywhere...Not a drop of noise in the place...any where...Full kitchen...Coffee (or tea) in the morning without having to get dressed and go out!...OMG! Fantastic...Secure building with a very friendly and helpfull staff!... Just one phone call to the front desk and you have the shuttle to take you to the strip!...there's so much more!... I would recomend this hotel to ANYONE who appreciates a home away from home..."
10,371,"Jul 18 2009 	Great Value	If you are traveling by car to Las Vegas, this hotel can not be beat. It is just south of the Airport (no noise though) and near to a Whole Food Market. The main problem with the Strip hotels is that there is always traffic jams, no matter the time of day and hotel parking is a fair distance from your room, usually meaning a trip via the casino to get to the guest elevators. At Homewood Suites, no traffic jams and parking is simple, right outside the door. The one bedroom suite has a kitchenette and living area. The breakfast is the usual fair, during the week they do provide evening meals, but we did not sample them. All in all, if you have transport, this hotel provides all that you need at a very reasonable cost."
11,371,"Jun 14 2009 	Nice Place but unhappy with service	Our family of 6 stayed for one night at the end of a trip outside the US. The property is very nice but we were not happy with the service. Half-way through the designated breakfast time, much of the food ran out....excuse was that they didn't expect to be so busy. That excuse is not acceptable. Next issue is that before going to breakfast we took our bags to the car, leaving only a couple of items in the room, including some medication that is taken after eating. The maid was not on the floor when we left the room. While we were out the room was cleaned...even though we had not checked out. The maid put the few items that we left on the bathroom vanity into a bag and had it on her cart, however the medication was gone. It had been thrown away. This action was also not acceptable. This is a nice place but does not appear to have good management. For that reason we do not recommend this property"
12,371,"Apr 23 2009 	Fabulous comfort and value.	We stayed one night here in the middle of our trip and were pleasantly surprised. The suites were large, the furnishings excellent and the beds the most comfortable of our entire trip. OK, you don't get the service of the top hotels but for the price it's hard to beat. The complimentary breakfast was great, and they offer a shuttle service to the strip, which makes up for the location. Highly recommended."
13,371,"Mar 20 2009 	Nice inside but too far from the conventions and taxi costs too much!	We had the two room suite #210, small kitchenette, fair living area, rooms are nice with standard tub with shower, good ac/heat, rooms with ceiling fans (helps), four of us.Beds are very soft and pillows not for me...bring your own....others in my group had no problem.Their continental breakfast...hummmm...well lets say stick to the coffee unless you have a strong stomach. Not much in the way of a store at the front desk.Taxi rides to Sands convention center averaged $25.00 (with tip) each way, car rental for four days cost us $285.00, well worth it (Hertz). The hotel is not well known so make sure you have the address when you leave to give to the next taxi driver to get back."
14,371,"Mar 6 2009 	Wonderful new hotel	This is a new hotel near the airport. The noise from the planes is almost non-existant and never did keep us awake or wake us up in the morning. The beds are super comfy. The shower is very nice. The bathroom amenities are 1st rate...Didn't use the kitchen at all but every thing was there if needed. Big LCD flat screen TV. Ok sofa and chair..Free breakfast was this side of yucky and the coffee provided in the room wasn't much better. I saw many families with small kids eating like it was their final meal, so be forwarned. The breakfast room is very small and you have to walk through it to get out of the hotel if you're in the back building. If you're going there to 'chow down' you'll be disappointed but if you want a good nights sleep you'll be in the right place. Close to the airport with a free shuttle. Great location if you need to catch an early flight or arrive very late at night. We arrived at 1am and had no trouble checking in. Front desk is very helpful and friendly."
15,371,Dec 27 2008 	fantastic	It is a great place for business trip and family. The internet is free. The complimentary breakfast is the best I had. The also provide free shuttle bus to the airport. This hotel is brand new. The bed is a real king size one. The prize is very reasonable. We all like it!
16,371,"Dec 26 2008 	Home Home on the plain	Homewood Suites by Hilton, Las Vegas, Hidden Wells Rd - To do Vegas right on a budget [ what? you don't have $2000 to drop on slots? me neither ] I always get a car and do the casino crawl during the day, retreat to a quiet suite here for a swim, food and rest, then back out at night. In three days you will be broke and exhausted. Mission Accomplished. Homewood Suites near the airport is an excellent choice for smart travelers who want to avoid the noisy drunks at the casino resorts. I got a studio suite 12/21/08 with full kitchen for $86 by calling direct. You can avoid the crowds, avoid the smoke, cigar smells, avoid the hideous cologne soaked hillbillies and avoid the late night hallway shenanigans that keep you awake in casino rooms. This place has free shuttle from airport - but you get your rent-a-car right across the street in the new Mega Car Rental Universe. Free shuttle to Mandalay Bay. The buffett B'fast is OK. The full kitchen will do just fine after a stop at Safeway and you can get local restaurant delivery. Fitness room to burn off the pizza-tostados. Get a room away from noisy elevator. Two bedroom suites are great for families, or just for that 'executive' lifestyle at a great price. Click on 'hotel by name' in a package deal search."
17,371,"Nov 14 2008 	Great for Large Families	This hotel was a great bargain. Our family of six adults and three children stayed comfortably in the two bedroom suite for only $151.00 a night. There were two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room with pull-out sofa, a kitchenette and three T.V.s! You can see the Strip but are away from the noise. The hotel offers an hourly shuttle to Mandalay Bay. There is a Whole Foods and an open-air mall nearby. They offer a hearty free breakfast and have a small convenience store near reception. An extensive selection of take-out food can be delivered to your room. I am glad to have found this place. It seems all other &quot;suites&quot; hotels are really one bedroom and a living room. This was actually two bedrooms and a living room. Everything still smelled new. I hope their prices stay reasonable."
18,371,"Oct 28 2008 	Comfortable and Quiet -- Yet Close to the Action	This hotel is a wonderful place to stay if you want to get a good night's sleep in Vegas - but still be close to all the hubbub during the day! Rooms are reasonably priced, new -- clean and spacious.The staff is very helpful and friendly. We were thrilled to find out that they have a shuttle that takes you to the airport or to the Mandalay Bay Hotel. You can get everywhere from there by walking, taking the tram or Monorail system. Taxis are available, but you have to wait forever and they are not cheap.We loved the free breakfast -- lots of variety.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
19,371,"Oct 21 2008 	Loved This Hotel!!!!!	We loved the Homewood Suites - we checked out of the Tropicana - after staying for 1 hour because we were so disgusted and booked at the Homewood. The rooms were so clean and nice and with the two bedroom suite - we had everything we needed. We parked close to our room and had a full kitchen and everything else we would need. The breakfast was great, waffles, fruit, bacon, eggs, cereal, etc. We would definitely stay here again. It was very close to the rental car return so it was easy to get there in the morning when we were leaving Las Vegas. This hotel is one that we will definitely look at next time we travel."
20,371,"Sep 15 2008	Brand New 	We stayed at this beautiful and new (opened 4 months ago) hotel in Sept. on a return trip from Utah. We booked a 2 bdrm/2 bath suite. It was gorgeous! One bedroom had a king size bed and the other bedroom had 2 double beds. There were sleeping pillows galore on the bed from which to choose from. The bathrooms had tub/shower combinations and a toilet with a door separating it from the vanity area. Neutrogena soap and lotion products were provided along with hair dryers (the hair dryers also had nightlights under them so you could have a bit of light at night). There were tv's in both bedrooms.The kitchen/living area separated the 2 bedrooms. The kitchen had a 2 burner stove, full size refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster, dishwasher, dishes and microwave. They provided 2 pods of regular &amp; decaf coffee for the coffee maker (most hotels only give you 1). The kitchen also had a beautiful granite countertop. There was a small sofa, ottoman and tv in the living area.The breakfast in the morning consisted of eggs, bacon, potatoes, cereal, waffles, fresh fruit, yogurt, toast &amp; bagels, along with several types of teas and coffees. Real plates, cups and silverware were provided (no plastic). The breakfast area was large and not overly crowded when we were there (and this was a Saturday). They provide shuttle service to the airport, but do not pick up from there. They also provide shuttle service at the bottom of the hour to Mandalay Bay hotel. I think you have to call them when you want to be picked up if you are the only ones going. The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. We would love to stay there again."
21,371,"Aug 7 2008 	Brand New Homewood	Our second stay in a Homewood didn't compare to our first stay, but it still was nice. The &quot;dinner&quot; here was anemic and disappointing, mini burritos and chips with salsa, really more of an afternoon snack, certainly not like the other Homewood I stayed at which had a real dinner. Breakfast was ok, certainly not up to the standard at the other Homewood either - tasteless scrambled eggs, dry sausage and cold amenities/pastries.This place was brand new. So new I wondered if anyone had stayed in our suite at all. Some lamps weren't plugged in and our hot water didn't work at first, the maintenance guy had to come and &quot;fix it&quot; somehow. We stayed in a 2 bedroom/2 bath suite (with sofabed and 3 TVs!) for only $150 which was awesome - full kitchen too. Certainly bigger than anything else you could ever have in Vegas for that price. The location itself is hard to find and away from everything else, really quite isolated - although it is obviously in a flight path of the airport. Still, I found it very quiet, just what we needed on the last night of our trip. My main complaint is that they need to work on their food and presentation. I'd rather have less choices which were high quality, than more stuff that was subpar. Certainly not the quality I've come to expect from Hilton hotels."
22,371,"Jul 24 2008 	great new hotel but one problem...	Greetings,Stayed at this hotel right next to las vegas airport on July 22nd.Very nice hotel, this is obviously some brand new construction. the rooms are super clean, and all have full kitchen equipment and a small living room area with sofa and tv. It is really well located for people that need to catch an early flight from las vegas mccarran airport and this hotel provides a shuttle service to the airport for free.So everything positive, except for one major problem. The noise. We had a room facing the hidden well street. The street itself is not noisy, the issue is that right next to hidden well street is a major highway (15 or 515) underpass and basically it was impossible for me to sleep during the whole night with this constant strong noise. The other members of the family apparently managed to sleep somehow decently, but if you are a traveller like myself that is sensitive to outside noise, than you may be in trouble.So bring ear plugs and/or make sure you get a room not facing the hidden well road and perhaps you will be ok./family from montreal, canada"
23,371,"Jun 13 2008	Great non-gaming extended stay	While I had reservations about staying someplace that just opened its doors, this place was ready for business. Located just south of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and east of Las Vegas Blvd, just a couple of blocks fromt the airport car rental center, this place great. The rooms were top notch, the breakfast and evening fare were great and the staff very helpful. A non-gaming property with no casino nearby, this is a great place to stay if you are not a gambler or prefer not to stay in a gaming hotel. All rooms have a small kitchen. Although I didn't use the pool, it looked inviting, but it didin't appear that you could do much tanning during the day, except at high noon, as the pool is located in an area surrounded by the hotel building. As I said before, this place is new, very little noise from the traffic or airplaines. This place is very similar to the same property located in Henderson, NV."
1,372,"Hidden Secret	This was my 3rd visit to Hooters.The staff is freindly and helpful, beds and pillows are comfortable. They have cable television and complimentary bottles of water in the rooms. Dan Marinos has the 9.95 prime rib 24 hrs and the Hooters hot wings are great. The price is right ."
2,372,Cheap weekend getaway	Got a great deal from the slot club for Sat and Sun. Made for a nice quick and cheap getaway with wife.
3,372,"Great views and Excellent Housekeeping	My wife really liked the prime rib special. I enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the fresh fruit and with biscuits.The housekeeping service was very good and thoughtful, she brought my daughter extra sheets w/o asking for them on the second night.Hooters restaurant waitress were friendly and helpful. Although menu was different: prices and sauce choices were minimum. Food was very good and beer too.Dixie bar did not have the great looking ladies that were pictured, only couple of bartender guys. Maybe seasonal?Casino girls were nice and nice looking. Machines need updating like the MGM across the street.The room AC was VERY old and HARD to maintain a consistant temperature makeing sleeping difficult at times. It is VERY LOUD and either Very HOT or COLD no in between.Although, we did not win the $$$, we will likely return if price is good."
4,372,"Good Value with a good location	The room itself could use some attention in that there was peeling paint and a slightly damaged drain in the bathroom. The hallways were rather dingy and did not feel very welcoming. The casino itself was good. Sure, not as upscale as many of the other casinos but the service was excellent and the staff were very helpful and welcoming. The gem of the hotel/casino was the gym, though I couldn't figure out how to turn on all the lights."
5,372,"You get what you pay for	I was suckered in by the Internet special. The casino itself is small but relatively clean, the rooms however were dirty and dated. I do not reccomend."
6,372,"Great place to stay for the price .... I have not one complaint!	My family and I always stay at hooters ! They are always accomodating our every need ! In this day n age , with the economics the way they are u just can't beat the prices of the rooms at hooters!!"
7,372,"Stay anywhere but here.	The young man at check in wasn't at all helpful, never mentioned a kids area which is listed on the survey card. The hallway on the10th floor had an offensive odor, the rooms and carpet are tired but adequate - certainly nothing to write home about. Elevators (garage &amp; room) were frightful - they did not always work. The slot machines were dirty. Security, housekeeping, and maintenance were helpful and pleasant. They do have a heated pool. The bed was comfortable."
8,372,"Not too bad for the price	We were expecting a total dump based on the price we paid, but were pleasantly surpirsed. It is a small casino with a lot of penny and nickle slots. There was a restraunt, club, and show on site. The food was pretty good, so were the drinks (just don't buy a drink, they are very expensive considering you can sit at a machine and get them for free. The gym had pretty good equipment for such a small hotel. The pool area was cozy with fire pits and different seating areas for visiting. The rooms were typical of a Howard Johnson or equivalent. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. However, there were food trays sitting outside someones door by the eleveator for 2 days which was anoying. We were in walking distance to many of the bigger hotels which was nice. All in all I would stay here again if I didn't want to spend the money at a bigger hotel."
9,372,"Perfect	Very good location to stay at south strip. One of Vegas smaller hotels, which I prefer.It doesnt take long time to get access to your room."
10,372,"Great Hotel with Mates	Stayed here for five nights on a trip with mates from the UK. Overall this is a smaller and more friendly hotel which means it doesn't take 30 minutes to get back to your room if you forget your camera.Yes it is not as plush as other hotels, yes the fascilities are not as up to date but if you need a hotel as a place to crash with mates then this is the place.The staff were all really friendly and helpful, there was a party going on all day, the pool and bars were excellent, and last but the not least the hooters bar is top class.Other reviews say this is off strip, it is but only 100 yards off strip! It is located next to the MGM and in a real good spot for getting about Vegas.Would I go back, hell yeah, would I go with my Wife, Hell NO, butu saying that her and her friends are staying there next year."
11,372,Nov 26 2009 	Quick easy and the stay was clean	I enjoy staying at the hotelThe service and food was pleasant
12,372,Nov 24 2009 	great hotel for the price	good value for being right off the strip good service perfect size not too big and over the top.Like the other hotel's on the strip perfect walking distance to the mgm and others.
13,372,"Nov 24 2009 	Seemed like best price but.......	I searched the web for a good price on a single night stay in Las Vegas. Hooters was offering a low price and what seemed to be a good location. So I booked the room. When we got there I learned that there was an extra &quot;cleaning&quot; charge of $12 per night. This increased the cost of the room by nearly 20%. The drinks were very expensive, $7 for a cocktail, $14 for a double shot of name-brand rum. Internet service is $13 a day.The hotel is located across the street from the MGM but you have to walk down the street a 1/4 mile to cross over on a pedestrian bridge. Then you have to walk the entire length of the MGM to get to the Monorail. The funny thing is I could see the monorail station straight across from Hooters! Finally, the rooms were functional but seemed to be converted from another hotel chain. There were no bedside lamps, only floor lamps in the corners. Wood &quot;patches&quot; were applied where the bed lamps used to be attached to the wall. But the room was clean.So beware of the price and be aware that the location is not as good as it seems!"
14,372,"Nov 24 2009 	I enjoyed my stay	Well after reading most of the reviews, I was very hesitant to go. But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. Check in did not take that long. The room was clean, beds were good. Staff were nice to deal with. I paid less than 40 bucks a day(fri-tues). Location was awesome. A few cigarette burns here and there, but room was better than I expected. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to save a few bucks."
15,372,"Nov 24 2009 	WOULDN'T STAY HERE AGAIN	My husband and I decided to go to vegas and on our drive up we booked the room here at Hooters. We thought it was a good price. However we will never stay here again. To start off the elevators are falling apart. There were cracks in the corners from the top to the bottom, if you push the wall a little you can see through---SCARY!!!! The hall ways to the rooms are so dirty and it smelled. There was no ice in the ice machine the whole time we were there and had to go up 2 floors to get ice. Our shower didn't work right. Half the water came out of the shower head and the other half came from the tub spout. The handle to turn on the water in the shower needed major maintence. Our air/heater was sooo loud that we had to turn it off to sleep. The capet was so dirty and the room smelled funny. However one nite we got in really late,(or you can say early, about 4am) and were hungry, so we ordered room service and I would say our food came fairly quick and it was hot and tasted good. We had decided to extend our stay but did not stay here. We booked another room at another hotel and stayed 2 more days there. This would be a decent hotel if they would keep up with the maintence and do a little more cleaning."
16,372,"Nov 23 2009 	Nice room good facility adequate staff.	We checked in and were given keys to an occupied room at the opposite end of the facility. Had to return to the lobby with baggage and baby for another room. We were never offered help with luggage which would have been polite after making us walk so far. Wanted big bed but got 2 standard, it was a pleasant surprise that we could get an infant bed. We liked the room, it was very clean and tasteful, not fancy but good. Beds were adequate.Big letdown was the staff. Most were polite but nowhere near the standard I find at the restaurants which we frequent. when we returned to the desk after being given the wrong room we were helped politely but never felt like we were important. The 2 desk people chatted with a 3rd employee from retail, the desk guy was trying to get a free shirt. The girl in the poolside cofffee shop in the morning was just plain rude."
17,372,"Nov 19 2009 	If this is a 3-star hotel I don't even want to know what a 2-star would be...	If you're traveling on a budget, pick something else. I'm pretty sure you'll be better off at Tropicana, Excalibur, Circus Circus, Riviera, etc... This place was awful. Their staff is not really friendly. The front desk guy was short and harsh when we were checking in. When we got to the room, the decoration was cheap and tacky, one of the lamps was damaged, the beds had a dip in the middle (like very used mattresses), the sink was clogged, and there were shampoo bottles from previous guests in the bathtub. My brother's room had a wet, used towel. Basically, the hotel has &quot;Please, remodel me&quot; written all over it.The hostess at the Dan Marino restaurant was not friendly at all. It looked like she was doing us a favor - and she wasn't very happy about it. Plus, they wanted us to wait 45 minutes to get a table at 3 in the morning even though we were only going to get food to go. The good things about the hotel were the wings and the location. And that's about it."
18,372,"Nov 17 2009 	Not bad for a B hotel off the main drag	Liked the hotel on the whole. Not as fancy as the MGM across the street, but close enough to the strip to get to things, accessible to the monorail and the prices were good."
19,372,"Nov 6 2009 	excellent holiday	this hotel was excellent , ideal location to walk anywere , rooms clean and had everything you needed casino was ideal size not too big but again had evertything you needed pool was gorgeous weather was lovely for november sat by the pool most days everyone in our group enjoyed it and they varied from age 21 to 60 men and women .room had 2 double beds in tv and computer games ."
20,372,"Oct 29 2009 	Won't go again!	I booked this hotel through Priceline.com. Unfortunately I wasn't expecting to see Hooters as a result. The front desk though it was quick to check in, the service was bad. Also, the hotel charges an additional $5.65 as a reserve fee that is also added onto the price which I wasn't expecting. Therefore, it ended up costing more then what priceline promised. The housekeeping staff charged me for water that I did not drink. I will definitely think twice before booking Hooters. You mind as well pay a few more dollars for a descent hotel."
21,372,"Oct 29 2009 	Excellent value for money just round the corner from The Strip	Check in and out were slow and the standard of service at the desk neither as efifcient nor as friendly as we experienced in other hotels and motels while in the US, however this hotel was excellent value for money (less than 35 for two nights!). We were supposed to have a Bungalow room but were given an Ocean View one instead - this turned out to be a blessing as it was several floors up away from traffic noise and music piped around the pool area from early morning. The room was large and well-appointed. The only gripe was that the bath took ages to drain of water when having a shower. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was good/varied and fruit plate I had was huge. Prices on a par with the other places we breakfasted during our holiday. The room was quiet, however we think that occupancy levels were pretty low. The other guests of the hotel were predominantly a younger crowd than us - we're in our late 30s."
22,372,"Oct 27 2009 	Great for the price	We are frequent travelers to Las Vegas. The Golden Nugget is our favorite place to stay, however, we have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip in our 50+ times to Vegas. Hooters was decent for the price. We paid $20 for sunday night which included a buy one get one free breakfast buffet at dan marinos, 2 complimentary tickets to Todd Paul and $100 in promo slot play. The casino is small, however, Tropicana, MGM, Monte Carlo, New York New York casinos are close by. The rooms are clean, however, the entire hotel - elevators, carpet, rooms, bathrooms are in desperate need of updating. The pool and hot tubs are nice. If you are on a budget this is a great option in vegas."
23,372,"Oct 23 2009 	Never again	I will never stay here again, The worse service ever. I would rather stay at Motel 6 where I have recieved better service. I was given a smoking room even though I told them due to me being asmatic I needed a non smoking room. They didn't even make an effort to accomodate me. The view I saw was trash. When the maid came in to make the bed it looked like she just threw the bedspread and pillows. The Dan Marino restaurant had extremely slow service even though it wasn't crowded. I was completely dissapointed. I have written a letter to the hotel manager but have yet to recieve a response."
24,372,Oct 20 2009 	Better than I expected from the reviews I read	Some friends of mine were going to Vegas so I headed out as well at the last possible moment. Was looking for a room on the cheap decided to give Hooters a try glad I did. The rooms are pretty much like a motel 6 room with Hooters trim. My room was fine and very clean house keeping did a great job. The room service was great as well both the restaurants were excellent and thrift priced compared to a block away at the strip. I am a person that likes a luxury room as much as the next guy my wife and I stayed at Bellagio in Sep in a suite for $450 a nite and it was luxury this room averaged $22 and was well worth the price. The $9.95 prime rib was great as well as the steak and eggs For $11.95
25,372,"Oct 15 2009 	Hooters better than I thought it would be!	After reading some of the negative reviews on this hotel/casino I was a little unsure, but...the price was right &amp; it was so near the &quot;strip&quot;.First, the room was clean, fair sized &amp; comfy! I also had a great view of the strip from my window!The pool was awesome because it is open 24/7! After a big day/night of LV, it was nice to swim or hot tub at any hour! It is nothing fancy at all. Just a nice &amp; clean pool (2 of them) &amp; 2 hot tubs.On site restaurants were fine (nothing special).The casino was nice because it was small &amp; clean.It is right across from MGM so you can just walk across the street to be in a huge casino, night life, studio 54 (fun night club!!) &amp; the tram! the tram will take you up the &quot;strip&quot;Tropicana is right next door &amp; Excalibur across from that. So it is near many fun things to do if you don't have a car. I stayed when the prices were dirt cheap. It was only $35 a night! but I see their prices have gone WAY up! too bad! it is not fancy! Not all that sexy either.The people who work there are real nice &amp; professional as well. the security guards were NOT awesome. They mostly talked to each other &amp; never really seemed to care what was happening around them. I had to ask them a question &amp; they both seemed annoyed I interrupted them! Oh well..."
26,372,"Oct 14 2009 	Would stay again	Not luxury but comfortable economy. Hotel is older and well worn but clean. Don't expect excellent room service. Our hair dryer broke and it took 1+ hrs to get a new one delivered (we left after an hour so I'm not sure how long it took). Hotel atmosphere is fun and laid back. Nice music playing. Room was clean and bed surprisingly comfortable. Walking distance to several other hotels. If you have the time I recommend visiting the VooDoo Lounge (on top of The Rio) in the evening. You get a beautiful view of the city and great music. If you get there early, you might even get free entrance passes."
27,372,"Oct 14 2009 	BED BUGS!!!	I stayed in the Hooters hotel in LV, NV from oct,9,2009, to oct 12,2009. I started getting itchy bumps, and i didn't know what they were until i found one of the bedbugs. It was disgusting! when we checked out i told the manager at the front desk about it, and she offered me 20$ off. The bites got worse, like i had an allergic reaction. Also, i am very scared i might have brought them back.The work experience of my life! I have already called the hotel and left a message with the main manager, and am hoping to be re compensated for my stay!"
28,372,"Oct 13 2009 	Great Hotel for the price and location not to great if you have minors.	We stayed at hooters las vegas from Oct 10 thru the 12th. We went to Vegas for a wedding and decided on this hotel as it was fairly cheaper and close to the strip. its a pretty small hotel not as big as i thought it would be the staff was very nice to you IF you where gambling if you where just walking through the casino they seemed to be very rude and very rude to my son. I have a 13 year old, we where walking to the garage and we where waiting for the rest of our party to catch up, so we stood right in front of the elevators to wait for them, this very rude person comes up (who works for hooters) and rudley asks him ARE YOU OVER 21??? i looked at her and said no he is not and your point! she tells me well this is a gaming area so he is not allowed here, i said ok well we are staying here and going to our car we are by the elevators (which mind you there are no games by) and she was like well he needs to wait in the garage! i looked at her and was like umm yeah i dont think so but thanks for your suggestion LOL! at that point the rest of our party arrived and we left. The gift shop sucks it only has a few items, most of the areas are empty or just have 1 or 2 shirts. OMG and the restaurant ewwww!! i had never eaten at hooters before so we decided to have dinner there our first night to try out the wings. Once again because we had a minor we had to wait longer as they only have one area for you to sit with minors. (all this really means is that the girls dont bend down and have there hooters all over the place LOL!) Once the wait was over we where seated, right by the kitchen area where all the traffic is because everyone is going back and forth to get the food. The girls...i was a little surprised i thought they would all be very pretty with nice bodies and that was not the case. I was sooo dissapointed with the wings they where just oozzing grease and had no flavor whatsoever and these where suppose to be the hot wings. All in all i would never go back to that restaurant.."
29,372,"Oct 8 2009 	Cheap price friendly staff but would prefer to stay elsewhere for a few bucks more	scored the room for $25 which included a breakfast. all staff we came across was friendly. room was a decent size but really needs to be updated. i would typically say it was amazing bang for my buck but in Vegas perspectives, i cant say such a thing. for about the same price or maybe $10, i couldve stayed at many other options including Excalibur, which i have stayed at before and was much nicer and with a great location. also Sams Town was cheap and better but I avoided due to nonconvenient location for my plans on my trip. overall, not terrible, but i personally would try something else on my next round."
30,372,"Oct 8 2009 	Not as nice as I thought- but definitely worth $24!	Hotel was okay. I expected it to be a little nicer since it said that it opened in 2006, but I think they just redid an older hotel. Dealers were really nice and taught me how to play craps. Had a lot of fun at that table. The dealers were not the standard &quot;Hooters&quot; type workers though- so that was different than I expected. I only paid $24 per night so it was a great deal in that regard and I would stay there again because it was so inexpensive. If you don't mind staying a tiny bit off the strip it'll work!!!"
31,372,Oct 8 2009 	budget hotel	Good hotel for the money. However if I had to do it over again I would spend a little more and get a lot more. the people were really nice. The food in Dan Marino's was horrible. The prime rib had more fat on it then meat.hooters food was normal but of course you paid more for that.No coffee maker in the room and no coffee in the hotel. The room was average but severely lacking in outlets. The rooms were called beach side so I thought I was going to see at least a view of the pool...nope a view of the parking lot.The pool was very nice and the staff including security by the pool were awesome!the hotel very quiet in the room areas so that was really nicesign up for the free chips just to get the coupon to see the comedian for 7.95. I laughed from the beginning to the end!! hilarious
32,372,Oct 5 2009 	great time	had a great time. check in was very good staff was great very informative. room was cozy for the price(best deal) went to see tod paul very good. casino was small but nice. pool was nice but very cold. Stayed there twice and loved it will stay there again. Food was great at marino (the steak with garlic sauce was excellent) Plus hooters food was great to. Check out was very easy. Needed a later check out and got it with no problem(thanks)
33,372,"Oct 1 2009 	Perfect for what we needed	We stayed here for 2 nights on a quick cheap trip in Aug 2008. We got a dirt cheap bungalo room and it suited our needs just fine. The pool area was a nice place to relax at night, the staff was friendly and more importantly it was like $30/night. If you want something that just works well for quick trips or if you're not planing on spending much time in the room this hotel was perfect. We're staying one day here again in December for nastalgia before moving on to the Bellagio for the remaining 4 nights. Cant wait."
34,372,"Sep 28 2009 	Hooters is just for Wings!!	LOOOVE hooters wings but not their hotel...waaat kind of place is this anyways?! we weren't in the room more than to change and sleep but wow was it run down. Moldy showers, Dirty Carpet, DUMB front desk staff, and to top it off as we were packing to leave I discovered ANTS on the bed that had found their way to my suitcase. One reason would be because Room Service didn't clean up food from the hallway ....just GROSS!"
35,372,"Sep 26 2009 	A HOOTING TOOTING HOTEL	we stayed at the hotel in 9/9/09 the hotel was nice. the down side was that the towels they provdided around the pool were very small to say the least (best take your own) the room was ok but it would be a lot better with fresh painted walls and a new carpet, the wardbrobe doors didnt work either. the breakfast buffee was ok but we found another hotel that was a lot better ( the next one up) the location was ideal it didnt take you too long to be on the strip about a 5minute walk. all in all the budget hotel gets my vote for the next trip."
36,372,"Sep 21 2009 	Great location it was a hoot!	Although off strip this hotel is in a great location. Check in was fast and easy, our room was standard but clean. Our window looked out on Tropicana and the strip, great views of NYNY and MGM at night. Our safe was faulty, i think the prveious guests left if locked but we called security and they were up in minutes to fix it. Weather was quite cool (even for us Scots) so we didn't spend much time by the pool. We did spend a wee while at the jacuizi next to the pool however. The pool area was clean and towels were available. The casino itself was very small compared to the others and got quite busy on the weekends when it filled up with guys. We ate a few times in Dan marinos which did a good breakfast. The beds were comfy and hotel noise was pretty minimal. Hooters is in walking distance of a lot of the major hotel/casinos so taxi and bus journeys were kept to a minimum. If I return any time soon and hooters is still stnading i will definately consider it."
37,372,"Sep 21 2009 	Great value for money	After reading some negative reviews on this hotel before arriving i thought it only fair to say how i found this hotel.Great location, clean rooms and exactly what i wanted for what was paid for the stay.Next year am thinking of going for 4 weeks to hooters.very satisfied."
38,372,"Sep 17 2009 	great stay	Was shocked to read other bad reviews for Hooter Las Vegas. We had a great stay and enjoyed our three nights here. We did have to queue for check in and it was through the Pokie Machines in the casino but it was resonably quick and nothing like the queues in the other hotel we had looked in.Great room and decor, very clean and tidy. Very close to The Strip and gas station, convenience store and Coco's Resturant. Also used both Hooters Resturants and brought souvenirs from Hooters shops. Our room over looked the pool, which we didn't use but plenty of people were and we did have drinks by it, very nice.We used the casino and enjoyed the free first drink when using a machine (not serious gamblers - had to say we had 'Been there done that' in Vegas!).I would say this hotel is more suitable for young people in party mode, although saying that we are in our 40's and still enjoyed ourselves."
39,372,"Sep 16 2009 	Great for the young crowd!!	We stayed one night here and loved the amosphere. it is not the highest paying casino on the strip but great to kick back and relax in. great for people in their 20s and 30s. Pool was cool, several seperated pools and hot tubs, one with a waterfall. didnt go in the hot tub, didnt look as clean as the pool. stayed in thr bungalow rooms off the pool, nice view, basic no frills room, bed was comfy, room was clean, a little outdated, but for our purposes it was great for $40 a night!!"
40,372,"Sep 11 2009 	HOOTERIFIC!	Came out with some friends for a softball tournament, had a blast at the pool party and the specials around the casino! Thanks for a great time!"
41,372,"Sep 8 2009 	Wouldn't stay again	It was the worse nite of our stay in Vegas, The carpet was filthy the valet was terible he suggested i was on something. LOL the front desk was so slow my grandma is faster then they are. the key cards didn't work my wife had to wait a 1/2 an hour for me to get back to here. The only thing i like there was the waitres in the Marino room and the wings. Thanks for a bad evening Hooters Jim"
42,372,"Sep 6 2009 	Stay Away from this Hotel	Worst Experience We have Ever had in Vegas. We visited second time Vegas and stayed in Hooters for 3 nights. We were so upset by everything with this hotel.1. We booked this hotel through hotel.com. When we checked in they gave us different room then we have selected and we have paid for in advance. There was only 1 person at the front desk and long queue.We waited for almost an hour. 2. There was only 2 persons at Valet parking and long queue of cars too. 3. Next morning we faced a terrible problem of water blockage in bath tub. We called 5-6 times to front desk, Maintenance, Operator etc. Staff was rude and not helping. Waited for 1.5 hr for engineer. We missed our show. 4. The same day we came back at the end of the day and found our keys are not working. We were on 16th floor and did back and forth to front desk 3-4 times to get keys fixed. Nobody cared.wasted 1 hour again in hall. 5. again there was a problem in toilet. Water was running on and couldn't use it for long time. Same as previous day with maintenance service.6. We expected some kind of apology/compensation at the time of check out for all the troubles we have faced but completely ignored.Stay away from this place. you would find better place on the strip or close to."
43,372,"Sep 5 2009 	Never stay there again!!!!!	Room had major issues. The bath tub didnt drain so the water back up to our ankles and the bathroon sink had plumbing problems. I told the front desk about the room as soon as it started that night. The next morning, the remodeling started next door.. When I asked to change rooms, the supervisor (she) told me it would be a hour before we could change. After a hour went by, I asked the front desk,they kept saying not sure when a room would be available, The one had a hole punched in it. After several hours went by, I asked the front desk again,he said still not ready yet., I told him that the supervisor said it would only be an hour, yea right! He went back and spoke to the same supervisor WOW he came up with a room, finally after waiting all day. I know we get what we pay for, But OMG this was very bad. So was your public relations. Your website is very false leading. At least one thing room service was friendly."
44,372,"Sep 2 2009 	Hooters!.......it was ok	-As far as the rooms go, the rooms are actually quite nice. The beds are comfy, there is a nice atmosphere in the rooms as well. -The casino is average and isn't nearly as big and glamorous as others on the strip but works well if you just want to play a couple of video machines and they have a few reasonably priced table games. -The pool is just fair, if your looking for a nice pool there are a lot of other places to go for a great value ie. (The Tropicana right next door has a fabulous pool for the money) location-it is a little off the strip. so if you are looking for a lot of time on the strip it would be wise to get a hotel right on the strip. ( the flamingo, harrah's all for around the same price. Restaurants- Hooters restaurant is good of course. Dan Marino's is just fair. -Overall it is just a run of the mill hotel in vegas. Its not the best but isn't the worst especially for the price on/near the strip."
45,372,"Sep 1 2009 	Did I really pay for this??	Just returned from a long weekend in Vegas and have to share with you. This place is a dump. From the snotty front desk, to the bad food, filthy dirty carpet in the halls, nasty windows. For the $30 price tag was expecting dated maybe but not just nasty gross.We went to the Dan Marino for Sunday brunch - OMG! Seat yourself fine..all tables dirty, busser took our drink order after 10 minutes, another 10 then someone else brought them. We got our silverware from another table, along with condiments, waitress was polite but a horrible waitress. After the entire 1 hour, I asked to pay for one buffet as i took one plate and left most of it. They did comp the meal but I would never go back again.Room was ok size but nasty carpet, filthy windows, and a/c unit that ran all of the time, and not quietly. Outside was 107 so turning it off was not an option. It was basically a spring break, sleep, puke and party situation. One passed out in the hall by the phones while I was walking to the restroom, another left a bucket of vomit by the soda/ice machine on our floor..it stayed all night and into the next morning..Save yourself and pay another 20 bucks and stay somewhere else. The only positive was the polite security guard that showed us to our room and came back again to open the doors when the keys did not work."
46,372,"Sep 1 2009 	Not Bad--	Check in was good. Hotel ,pool and casino is small.Did not win at the casino,did see someone win 1000.00 on the free 100.00 games.Was upgraded to the tower rooms,no charge.The rooms were ok--mostly just slept there.The cleaning service was good-The air condition worked good in the room.Stayed 4 nights--190.00--not bad--You have to walk to the MGM to get to the strip--or else a long walk up the street--only a 12.00 taxi fare from the airport-Overall you have to get a good deal to stay here--It is like a hotel,good to slept- shower and go do your thing.Did not eat there not sure how the places are.Not a bad place--they do try---"
47,372,"Aug 30 2009 	Disgrace to the LAS VEGAS scene	This hotel is not fit to be in or anywhere near the strip let alone in front of the MGM.This hotel was of low quality, very old, dirty, grotty and the rooms/corridors are rubbish. This hotel is no comparison to the neighbouring 'Real Casinos'.The pictures on their website are very misleading.Save yourself the disappointment, paythe extra and go to a decent casino/hotel like MGM, Bellagio, Wynn, etc. You can probably even get a room in Luxor for the price of Hooters. Luxor is not as booming as the main casinos, but atleast its decent, fairly new, neat and looks wicked on the outside - like a pyramid.They even charged us a resort fee after we had left, on our credit card. When we emailed them, they said its in the small print onthe booking agreement. I have checked the booking agreement and it says nothing aout such nonsense.Also, on check out, they told us no more charges, yet they di the dirty on our credit card!"
48,372,"Aug 29 2009 	Dingy rooms but okay overall	I probably wouldn't have stayed here, but I got a great deal on a room, so I gave it a shot.Pros:Small casino - easy to get to/from your room. Didn't do much gambling, but made out pretty good on what I did, and the cocktail waitresses were quick to bring comped drinks, even when I was just playing penny slots.Very friendly staff - upgraded my room for free, bartenders were cool and made good drinks. Nice eye candy from most of the Hooters girls.Decent location - technically off the strip, but you can be on Las Vegas Blvd. within minutes. If you cross Tropicana to the MGM's back entrance, it is a quick walk to get to the monorail. If you're planning to go downtown, you can head a block south and get the route 109, which is cheaper, less crowded, and much faster than the Deuce. Room service food was good overall - got to my room in about 15 minutes and the quality of the food actually wasn't that bad.Good deals on food if you're not too picky - the Dan Marino's tries to be classy but basically it's a glorified Hooters. The 25 cent wings after midnight did hit the spot after a long day of drinking though.Beds were clean and comfortable. It was actually pretty quiet in the hallways and I didn't hear any noise from my neighbors - overall I got some good sleep in the room.Cons:Elevators look and sound like they're about to collapse. They're almost as bad as the notorious ones at the Imperial Palace.Hallways and rooms are in serious need of rehab. New paint job and carpets are in order - lots of stains, cigarette burns, etc. A room service tray I placed outside of my room to be picked up was left there for over 24 hours.Ice and soda machines on the floor did not work.A/C unit was extremely loud.TV seemed like it was about to go on the fritz - sound kept going in and out. Ordered a movie one night and it kept going back to the PPV menu.Overall, if you're a guy looking for a cheap room to basically sleep and shower in, and aren't picky about your accomodations, this might fit the bill. Overall, if you're looking for cheap digs, I would prefer getting something closer to midstrip like Imperial Palace or Bill's, but if you get a good deal, Hooters may be worth your while.FYI - do not take a shuttle from the airport to get here. I figured that since Hooters was so close to the airport, it would be a quick trip - no such luck. Took well over a hour, and the shuttle I arranged to pick me up was over a half hour late before I decided to just grab a taxi. The extra $5-10 you'd spend on a taxi versus a shuttle is well worth it."
49,372,"Aug 28 2009 	Not that bad	My fiance decided at the last minute to leave to vegas a day early so we booked Hooters for $20 and were on our way trecking the desert in the night. We arrived at 1am and quickly checked in. We were upgraded from a bungalow room to a tower room on the 8th floor of the bay view tower for free. we also got 2 free breakfast buffets at Dan Marinos but i suggest you skip that unless you are low on money and want a free meal. Not much selection and the food was bland but hey its free. The elevator from the parking garage into the casino is pretty old and dingy. Yes the casino is small but there is not much that Hooters could have done with it. San Remo was a tiny casino and Hooters looks like they have done the best they could have in making it over. We played craps after dropping our bags off in our room and the craps dealers were extremely nice and helpful. Easily the nicest dealers i have been around in vegas. Thanks for everything Vee and Andrew! You have to remember that Hooters doesnt make itself out to be amoungst the belagios and venetians of vegas. They are a mid level hotel were you can relax and have fun. if you are a picky person who finds flaws in many things then you should definitely not stay here. if you like to kick back and have fun, i would recommend staying at hooters"
50,372,"Aug 26 2009 	Love the place - Highly reccomended	I highly reccomend this hotel, clean and lively and cheap. This was my 3rd time here and would not stay anywhere else."
51,372,"Aug 21 2009 	DO NOT Stay At Hooters Hotel 	First off let me start by saying, I am absolutely not a picky person...as long as I am in a clean environment, I'm good. I wanted to stay at a cheap Hotel in Vegas because I wanted to spend my money elsewhere (gambling, dining, shopping etc), well not only was Hooters cheap it was extremely dirty and gross. The location was not that bad (unless you want to be in the middle of the strip). The check-in/check-out people were extremely rude, they were not helpful with our questions and gave us total attitude. The casino was amazingly small and was kind of a joke. While walking down the hall to get to our room we noticed lovely stains all over the floor, which were gross. When we got into the hotel room we noticed stains everywhere. The A/C was incredibly loud and it sounded like there were small animals in the unit trying to escape. The bathroom was horrible...There was one towel &amp; one wash cloth. The bed had no sheet on it and we had to call room service up to see if they could put a sheet on our bed, which took 2 hours. Our room keys constantly would not work and we would have to make frequent trips back to the front desk to get out keys renewed. At the end of it we noticed almost $300 added to our hotel bill, they had &quot;accidently&quot; messed up our bill and put random charges onto it, which we had to fight them on taking the charges off. Seriously, if I could do my Vegas trip over again I would spend a little more money and stay at a nicer &amp; cleaner hotel. Hope this helps!"
52,372,"Aug 20 2009 	Grotty But liveable	We staid in this hotel in march 2008,We wished we had stayed in circus circus, the place was full of frat style men, trying to relive there youth, giving unwelcomed attention to any female that walked past, We were asked for a massive security deposit at check in, we had no credit or bank cards with us , so had to pay cash, the reception desk was unsympathetic and just stared at us whilst chewing gum, never have I paid deposits and I have stayed in Hiltons etc,belive me this is no hilton,We stayed out in the back house through the small grotty casino and through the pool area, The room was clean , and we had a TV and a small balcony, the best bit was we had rear parking and rear access to our room so not having to troll through the casino front again, its in a great location and you can walk the strip etc no problem, I am glad I stayed there for the experience but will never go there again"
53,372,Aug 18 2009 	Stay anywhere else	This place is going downhill. The rooms are small with double beds. The casino is small. Hooters restaurant is not even open 24 hours! Dan Marino restaurant has the worst food. The staff is very friendly and the location is fine. I just wouldn't stay here again.
54,372,"Aug 12 2009 	Not a deal just dirty	I looked at the reviews and I decided to give Hooters a chance, since I was looking for a &quot;deal&quot; and I knew I wouldn't be spending too much time in the room anyways. My girlfriends took me to Vegas for my bachelorette party and I didn't want them to have to spend too much money on a hotel room. Well, I kind of wish we spent a little bit more. First off, I thought the crowd in the casino would be young and fun group of twenty and thirty somethings. Insteasd, It was a bunch of old and trashy people who looked like they had been up for 48 hours straight. I guess it wouldn't matter if you just need a clean place to stay and you don't plan on gambling or using the pool facilities. Unfortunatly, the room was just as bad. Honestly, I am not a picky person. If the place is basically clean, I can deal with it. Well, the room just had a nasty feel. The bed sheets had stains on them (I didn't even try to firgure out what it was), half of the carpet was wet and we all had to wear shoes in fear of athletes foot. The beds were tiny and the bathroom was not cleaned very well. Oh, and the a/c was so loud it kept me up at night. Again, I am not picky, and I really think this hotel is nasty. In fact, we were tempted to go find another hotel!! I am all for saving a buck, but please spend a little bit more and avoid this dirty place! Trust me!!"
55,372,"Aug 8 2009 	Great deal 	I booked 3 nights at Hooters during the winter for a really great deal (less than $50 for 3 nights). Originally, we booked for a bungalow, but the staff was kind enough to upgrade us to a room inside the hotel (the bungalow is separate from the hotel). I was easy and convenient to get from the elevator to the room and very comfortable as well. The room was very beachy themed and the bed was well cushioned. It was a quick walk to MGM and the people there are accommodating."
56,372,"Aug 4 2009 	Good value	We stayed 3 nights in July - we had stayed at this hotel before, in 2007 and went back because of the relaxed atmosphere and cheap room prices. This time around it seemed the Hooters girls weren't quite as happy and chirpy however. Room was a good size, clean and comfortable. Staff at the reception desk gave us the bare minimum in terms of welcome and pleasantries. This is a smaller casino which we liked, as it doesn't take long to get from your hotel room to the Strip. The pool area had security guards which was good as there were a few that had had a bit too much to drink - they took care of any unsavoury characters quickly and discreetly. The only complaint I have about the pool is that there were no pool attendants to clear away used towels, empty drink containers, debris etc. Great value and a fun place to stay. If you don't want your boyfriend/husband looking at girls in skimpy shorts and tight singlets, this is not for you. Great for a boys/girls trip away and couples if your wife/girlfirend is not the jealous/psycho type."
57,372,"Jul 26 2009 	WARNING! False Advertising!	We booked the &quot;Standard w/$400 of Extras&quot; and recieved only one of the offers included in the list of &quot;extras&quot; which was the $100 of promotional slot play for each of us. The free buffet, rib special, complimentary drinks at Pete &amp; Shorty's and Dixie's, the complimentary tickets to The Mentalist, the $10 in match play, and the $10 in free play all were not fulfilled. When we brought this to the attention of the management there they just spouted off that they &quot;reserve the right to change the promotions and other offers at any time.&quot; Well the thing is we wouldn't have stayed there without the $400 of extras we thought we were getting and paid more for the same room because of those extras that were supposed to be included with the room. Then there was the room issues, first they didn't have the 2 double bed standard room we reserved but instead put us in thier cheapest &quot;bungalow&quot; room with one bed. First one had ants all over the place, Second one the sink and shower didn't drain and had ants but fewer than the first room. The third room they moved us to was a little better since the beds were actually made but even after turning the shower head on the water continued to come out of the spout so you ended up in over 1 foot of water by the end of your shower! They finally put us in the correct room the next day but we paid more than we should have for that first night and moving your luggage four times in 12 hours isn't the best way to start what you want to be a relaxing vacation. Don't stay here whatever you do you can stay at New York New York or Excalibur or Luxor for just a little more and not have to deal with endless problems."
58,372,"Jul 18 2009 	Great times	The room was great, the service too. All in all I had a great time - Loved to eat my breakfast by the pool :)"
59,372,"Jul 17 2009 	Grea Place to Stay If you're not looking for a resort	I have stayed at this hotel with my girlfriend many times. We are able to get many comps to shows and museums because of my girlfriends connections, so we don't like spending money on a hotel because we frequent the city so much. The rooms are nice and clean and keep with the same hooters style as the restaurants. The rooms and the casino aren't too fancy, but it's hooters (it's not suppose to be fancy). I would not stay here if I was planning a big trip, but for the Vegas regular or spur of the moment Vegas trip, this hotel should do nicely. My girlfriend likes the place, but I'm sure its a much bigger hit with the guys than the ladies (Nothing can beat their 25 cent midnight chicken wing special also tip the drink girls in casino and the drinks come non stop). You can also get ridiculously good rates on this hotel if you look and even cheaper if you frequent the hotel. We stayed for three nights, which included new years eve and new years for less than $200. I booked a four night stay this summer for a total of $60 (I have only stayed in the tower rooms, be careful about the bungalow rooms they are detached from the casino and seem a bit seedy). I missed the earlier special this year which was half the price. You also receive a coupon book if you sign up for their players card (many buy one get one free). They give you free show tickets with the purchase of one drink, just look for the special. Just remember don't expect an over the top Vegas hotel room here, this is not a mega resort. It's literally around the corner from strip, what more could you want!"
60,372,"Jul 16 2009 	average hotel good location	We stayed here 4 days in May 08. - Hotel is average+- Location is good behind MGM but in the point that nobody pops in accidentally. Probably that is why it wasnt that lively, there were only few people in the evenings. - The pool area is nice- Also the small gym is somehow adequate for little working out- Food wasnt that special, normal junk- That time there was nothing special going on in the evenings- Rooms were okIt was pretty much what we've expected for that price. Less lively though."
61,372,"Jul 11 2009 	excellent dollar valueS	Stayed June 28 to July2 everything was perfect. A 500 ft. walk to the strip, a clean air contioned room, agreat atmosphere especially at the pool with excellent bartenders and lots of meals under $10.00 plus the usual wing promotions. Dave J Ottawa Canada"
62,372,"Jul 11 2009 	the friendliest place in town	I have stayed at Hooter's twice now and found it to be the most friendly staff around. The receptionist, the waiters and waitresses, the barmaids, etc. The atmosphere there is fun and exciting with attention to customers. My boyfriend and I always come back here. We will be coming a 3rd time soon. The rooms are very comfy and make you feel like your in a tropical climate. We have gambled in many other casinos in town and the Hooter's is best because the atmosphere is so fun. We are not big gamblers so we don't get perks. Its just nice to be waited on so well. We have eaten at Dan Marino's rest. The food is awesome. Location is clooose to the strip! Great value and service."
63,372,"Jul 6 2009 	Major disappoinment.	Staying at the Hooters sounded like a lot of fun beforehand. Unfortunately the hotel was shabby, smoky, and sleazy. Staff was tired and bored, even the famous &quot;Hooters Girls&quot; acted like they would rather be somewhere else. Only positive thing was the location, right next to MGM Grand."
64,372,"Jul 5 2009 	Avoid!	went open minded after reading reviews on here before and seeing it was down as 3 star. I,d give it 1 star. Casino and first impressions on arrival good, however after checking in noticed how seedy and grubby really is, the corridors to rooms dark and smelt of dope also stained grey carpets. The room no quilt covers on for say 5 out of 7 days, stained horrible brown carpet in room and cheap wooden furniture. Eating in Hooters, avoid buffet breakfast or any food at all in restaraunt, looked like it had been there days and not much choice, surprised me people eating in there. Round the pool area dirty never saw it cleaned round whilst there, chicken bones old straws etc.. all over floor. Brown padded seats all stained no way would you sit in one in shorts. So all in all hotel to avoid there is better hotels cheaper! only thing going for it location opposite MGM, good for going over for breakfast."
65,372,"Jul 4 2009 	Ticks every box and cheap	I have stayed at Hooters 3 times now, I think it is brilliant as it is always very cheap, and is in a great location just across the road from the MGM. The rooms are very similar in size to the other hotels I have stayed at in Vegas - Paris, Luxor, MGM. I have never had a problem with my room, the beds are large, and I have never had a reason to complain about anything. The bathrooms are fine too. The pool area is decent, small, but there is a pool side bar, and although the pools are small, they are decent enough, and some of them are heated. The casino area is small, and the bar near the entrance of the hotel is tiny, but we only really use it as a meeting point, or for a quick drink before heading out elsewhere.There is a restaurant called Dan Marino's, I have eaten there a few times for breakfast, and it does good food and is handy late at night when you've got the munchies. There is a 24 hour shop next door to Hooters too, so you can get drink and snacks to have in your room from there, as well as toiletries etc, so that's handy.The gambling area is very small, and the only negative about Hooters is I don't view it as a hotel you'd go to for a night out, as it is small and doesn't have a proper bar. I just like it because it is cheap, good value for money, and the rooms serve their purpose. I might go back to Vegas in November and I will stay at Hooters again, I'd always stay there in the future, unless I win the lottery or go with a girlfriend!"
66,372,Jul 2 2009 	Great stay better than expected	I would recommend Hooters to all that were curious about staying here. Originally booked a bungalow and was upgrade to a lower floor on the tower upon arrival. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. That was all that I needed. The food was alright for the price. The casino was small but fun. I would stay here again.
67,372,"Jul 1 2009 	Nice Pool-O.K hotel for a quick night	We pre-booked a very cheap rate at Hooters because our plane was getting in at midnight and we needed a cheap place to crash. If you're looking for the same and you can get a really low rate then Hooters is fine for a quick night. It's on Tropicana Blvd across from the MGM hotel(and monorail station), about a five minute or less walk to the strip. Check-inThe Attached parkade didn't appear to have an elavator but there is parking out front. My wife and I checked in and they were out of the bungalow rooms we had booked so they &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a tower room for the same rate. Check-in was quick and friendly but be aware they charge you $5 each night for a resort fee. It's not a resort.....The casino area is all right, basically a hooters restaurant with slot machines and tables. RoomsWhen Hooters bought the hotel they threw down some new carpet, painted the walls and nailed up some surfboards in the halls. Be warned the halls are dim and and the dark paint doesn't help much. The rooms aren't anything to write home about; the beds and sheets were clean and comfortable, the linoleum was old and peeling in the bathroom, the fixtures were old and stained, the walls were thin and the sliding window to the false deck didn't lock. A typical budget motel room.Public areasThe casino was fun with a party atmosphere, lots of good games, and access to cheap drinks if your not gambling. The free form pool was built when they bought the hotel and is the highlight of the property with a bar, a few hot tubs, a waterfall and sandy areas for lounging. Dan Marinos is a 24 hour restaurant with a late night wing special and a breakfast buffet. (get the 2-1 coupon for signing up for the Owl Club players card.) They also have a Hooters restaurant, comedy theatre, Dixies country bar and another casual bar. Overall, Hooters is O.K for a night for the under 40 crowd, I would recommend it to a friend for a cheap place to stay close to the airport, it would be great for a bachelor party but I wouldn't recommend it to a single women because of the dark halls and laxed security."
68,372,"Jun 29 2009	Worth a look for those on a budget.	The casino is fun, the pool is decent and the price is right. The rooms are very basic, but clean and a good value. The pool loses the sun around mid afternoon, so plan on getting your sun early. The casino is allot of fun, the brunch at Dan Marino's is decent and the hooters restaurant is a hooters restaurant. Close to the monorail station and a 5-10 minute walk to most of the south end strip casinos, this is a good option for those on a budget.The parking garage is brutal and needs to be cleaned up, it is by far the worst part of the property."
69,372,Jun 27 2009 	Fun Place to Stay!	My boyfriend and I stayed here during the week of Memorial Day 2008. We were upgrade to a suite on the top floor when we checked in. It was beautiful with a great view. There was no line at all at check in. The line to get their players club card was long and moved slow. The hooters on site is on par with any other Hooters! It a fun place to stay on a budget! My only complaint at all is the parking garage. It stinks and it's a little scary at night!
70,372,"Jun 23 2009 	Dirty Dirty Dirty	Ok went there with my family, Wife and 2 kids (5 and 8)... The elevators from the parking garage down to the hotel stunk of vomit and were covered in obscene grafiti! The staff was less than enthusiastic about helping you and seemed to make you feel as though you were bothersome for asking questions or requiring assistance. The rooms were dirty, Over an inch of years worth of &quot;Dust bunny&quot; dust built up completely around the entire floorboard and corners of the rooms. The carpets were covered in Cigarette burns, &quot;on a non smoking floor&quot;, and the other guests would be sitting in the hallway, smoking and drinking and blasting music as though this was their freshman dorm in college! The kids liked the pool, as long as the smell of sewage doesn't bother you. Overall I have been to better in third world countries, but as with all the reviews... WE GOT WHAT WE PAID FOR..."
71,372,"Jun 15 2009 	way better than expected!	honestly, after reading all of the reviews i was REALLY worried about staying here. we had booked a bungalow room in early May at a really good price. on the way there, we called to see if we could get early check in (around 1pm), the staff was super friendly and was able to get us checked in around 1 instead of the normal 4pm check in time. what was even better was that instead of getting a bungalow room, we were upgraded to a tower room which was really awesome. the room was decorated really fun and the beds were very comfortable. the bathroom was so-so. there were some mildew spots in the tub and the carpet looked slightly greyish, but nothing to make us cringe! i was really pleased with our stay, its a really good place to stay on a budget and if you just need a place to stay and its REALLY easy to walk to the strip from it, we felt like we were on it! i really wouldnt listen to the negative reviews about this place because i really feel like they are left by people who expect this place to be as nice as the MGM or something which obviously it isn't because its a 3-star hotel! the only bad complaints i have are the parking garage was a little sketchy, the waitress' at the hooters restaraunt are bad and the breakfast at dan marinos was not tbe best."
72,372,"Jun 10 2009 	Great value better than expected	I chose Hooters for our 3-night stay due to the value ($26 per might) and the location (just off the strip caddy-corner from MGM Grand). I had read the reviews and was prepared for a mediocre place, thinking we'd be spending most of our time outside the hotel anyway, so the hotel itself didn't matter much.But I was pleasantly surprised - the room was fine, plenty of pillows, no waits at the registration counters, no extra charges, a great view of the mountains, extremely polite housecleaning staff. Great value if you ask me! Here's the rundown:Casino: Very loud sports-bar-ish, nothing upscale or elegant about it. But considering it's Hooters, what do you expect? One drawback... the elevators to our room were at the far end of the casino, so you had to walk the entire casino every time you wanted to go to your room. Luckily it wasn't a huge casino like some others, but would have been nice to have the elevators a bit more convenient.Restaurants/Bars: Ate at the Hooters restaurant the first night. Felt like a Hooters. Went to the Dixie's Dam Bar the first night also. Somewhat strange experience. Lots of blaring hip-hop music with a few gorgeous dancers clearly employed by the bar, surrounded by a bunch of middle aged men just standing and staring. We didn't stay long.Location: Was fine... had hoped for an easier trip from the airport, given that it's IMMEDIATELY next to it, but the cab ride from the airport is still $13, and the airport shuttle bus (at $6.50 per person) drops off at Hooters last, making it a long trip. But walking to the strip wasn't hard... Just go through the Tropicana parking lot and you're on the strip, with elevated walkways taking you to New York New York and MGM Grand.Pool: Looked nice and seemed fairly popular during the day... only one of the two hot tubs worked, but it was pleasant enough the one night we used it.Parking: Had a small parking lot right in front, and we never had any problem finding a spot. It was easily the most convenient parking of any hotel we visited.Cleanliness: A little mildew around the tub, and the window was little dirty making the view not quite as nice as it could have been, but otherwise no complaints... and certainly clean enough given the low price!Service: We had no bad service experiences... I was actually blown away by the friendliness of the maid in the morning. When we accidentally locked ourselves out of the room bathroom they sent up someone to unlock it within about 10 minutes.Loudness: There were a couple times when people from the pool were pretty loud (even from our room on the 17th floor), but it didn't bother us. We were in Vegas for a good time, with no kids, so a little bit of drunk singing wasn't an issue. It didn't go on too long or too late, and the other rooms around us were perfectly quiet.Overall: Giving this hotel a 4-star rating based on the value of what you get for the money... if it were more expensive, the rating would probably be a three. If I were coming to Vegas for a fun trip and needed something cheap, I'd stay here again."
73,372,"Jun 10 2009 	We had a hoot!	Our only really problem with this hotel was finding a room...when we first checked in the first room we were allocated was very noisy, the second hada broken window and chewing gum stuck to the table. We struck it lucky 3rd time and got a great room with views down the Strip. (Please be aware we are not fussy people!!!)The location of the hotel was great, and the value for money was good. We went as a group (4 Guys, 2 Girls) and we all had a positive experience at Hooters.We ate at Dan Marinos and the food was good, esp breakfast."
74,372,Jun 8 2009 	The only good part was the beds and Brandon who checked our bags and car.	The front desk was not able to help without constantly going and asking the manager for help. The casino area was tiny and the music way too loud. The Hooters restaurant was overpriced and the food was not nearly as good as the regular restaurants food. Dan Marinos restaurant was a better deal and had mush better food. The best employee there was Brandon who checked in and delivered our luggage to our room and also did double duty as the valet for our car.
75,372,"Jun 7 2009 	Would not stay there again	Second time I've tried the hotel. First time had to be moved from cabana area to the Towers because the first room was overrun by ants. This time the room in the tower was only superficially cleaned. The carpets are filthy, cellophane wrapper on the floor, bathroom was just not clean. The hotel needs a thorough top to bottom cleaning and new carpets. Hotel charges and extra $6/day on top of quoted rate (deceptive advertising on internet) Also charges almost $9/day for 8 hrs of internet connection (ripoff) Too bad as this is one of the friendlier hotels in Vegas."
76,372,Jun 1 2009 	The beds are so comfy!!!	Don't expect too much. The place was just slightly improved from what it was. But the beds are super comfy! If you're in Vegas and just need a bed to crash on - this is the place for you!
77,372,"May 30 2009 	Do not stay here!	This place is the worst of the worst. Dirty and run down. Lots of drunks and just a terrible place. I had paid for 3 nights here thru a package deal but I left after the first night and got a real room at the MGM. Trust me....do not stay at Hooters unless you are a scum and love rubbing elbows with other scumbads and dirty walls, fllors and furniture. I want to throw up thinking about the place."
78,372,"May 28 2009 	who can complain for $20?	We stayed for 2 nights with our 8mo baby. We paid $20 per night for the room (plus a $5 resort fee) and we got a fantastic room with a view towards the strip.Hooters is located just off the strip, opposite the MGM, so all the tourist buses are just across the road. We've stayed here before, when it was the San Remo and you seriously can't complain for the price. The room was clean, the portacrib was provided free of charge. My only complaint was no fridge, but we could have upgraded for $25 if we really wanted one. Oh, and you have to pay for WiFi, but that's about it."
79,372,"May 21 2009 	Vegas Vacation 2008	We stayed in Hooters Hotel Casino we reserved a Bungalow Room we checked in got our room and went out to eat. We were going to walk to the strip since Hooters is right off. As we were walking the wind was so bad we only made it to the Tropicana next to Hooters we looked around while we were there and since I had just drove close to 11 hours so I was tired and we decided to get some of the Hooters Famous Wings (big disappointment) Hooters will not sever you if you walk-up and order at the bar you need to buy a drink and put a nipple on it because the wings take a long to fly to you. So after 15-20 minutes waiting we finally got them and since there was no sitting spaces available and I had an 18 Pack of Ice Cold Corona's in the room we went back and ate there. Now maybe what I think they forgot to drain the wings from all the grease, there was about a cup and a half in each container my wife passed on eating them and settled for the cold cuts and french bread we brought with us. I turned in about 11pm I know it's early but I was up at 4am that morning and drove all the way here so I was tired! Then about 2:30am I woke up needed to take a wizard as I walked in to the bathroom I turned on the light and there they were COCKROACHES scattering I did my business and woke the wife and call the front desk, the said they would look in to it, but what was there to look at I wanted them dead or a new room out of the bungalow area too close to the pool and that attracts roaches. I could not wait or sleep so I went to the front desk. Now surprisingly the guy there was looking for another room and he said he tried calling the room with no answer but who knows for sure if he did. He had another bungalow room which I turned down so he put us up on the 15th floor in the tower, a lot better away from the pool and roaches.I even took one of the bell hops since he was there not doing any thing and he was cool we drank a couple of beers as we moved, he had to be discrete about it but in the next few days he hooked us up with tickets and booze as long as he could have a few drinks in our room I was cool with that he even brought a pizza and a big calzone on night about midnight some one ordered it and got in to a fight and checked out. So this what to seem like a bad start to our stay turned out all right.I can't tell you the guys name don't want him to get in to trouble if the wrong person reads this.All well that ends well."
80,372,"May 21 2009 	Poor Management	We had one night in Vegas and when we got to Hooters to check in, we found a line to the back of the Casino. We were told that people in front of the line had been waiting for 3 hours. This was dinner time and we were very tired and we now had to spend our night waiting in line. Not only that, but they did not do anything to make the wait more comfortable. When I asked the security personnel why the line was so long, I was given a death stare and told that the computers were down as though I was personally responsible for this. When we finally got to our room, the bathroom was disgusting. There was shampoo dripped on the shower curtain along with mildew. It had obviously not been cleaned in quite a while. The caulk was all mildewed and falling out. The floor was dirty. The floors were dirty throughout the hotel, actually. We were given a free mediocre breakfast buffet for our trouble."
81,372,"May 20 2009 	Too dumpy to pass muster	I've stayed at 18 hotels in Las Vegas, and I think this is the worst one I've stayed at.This is a very old hotel that was purchased by Hooters. They put a Hooters restaurant on the first floor, put some surfboards in the elevator lobbys, and that's pretty much it. When I stayed there, I got free breakfast every morning, free show tickets to see the Mentalist and Bobby Slayton (both of which are no longer performing there), all that for $29, and that made it tolerable."
82,372,"May 20 2009 	The Smell of the Pool Rude Staff Computers Down and the LINE!	We had found a $25 web only, non-refundable deal. We thought to ourselves we just needed a cheap one night stay before we had to catch a plane the next morning... boy little did we know it came with the aggravation of a football field long line and a rude staff. They told us when we saw the line to stand in, &quot;our computers are down, they have been for three days, now go stand in line.&quot; When we paid online, directly through their website, it took our payment, no problem. But when it came to getting our room, good luck. We stood there for an hour and moved 5 feet (no, it's not an exxageration). Thought I would check out the pool in the meantime. When I went outside, it smelled like something had died, garbage all over the pool area. When I found a chair to sit in, I think I caught something. We ultimately did not want to spend the whole night and following morning in the line, so we left. FORGET the $25 web special, for about $20 more you could go to the LUXOR, which is about a 100 times better than this DIVE."
83,372,"May 18 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised!.	It was a lot minue booking for my bday celebration weekend; I already did a lot of online hotel bookings but was not fully satified. I am usually a budget traveller and not to gaga with Big hotels. I usually just want a hotel with nice location and clean rooms to stay after a long day of strip stroll.I was pleasantly surprised with Hooters.For 100/nite for the weekend its a good value.What i really like if the nice touch in our room we stayed in. NIce queen bed with summer decor..They also grant our request for view of the strip. I usually look for nice bedding and restrooms in the places i stayed. They meet my expectations. Im planning to stay there again due to its location, value and service!"
84,372,"May 14 2009 	Dead bugs in room smelt like sewage and dirty pool to start!	To start the room had dead bugs on the floor...not just one many, our comforters had burn holes in them, the bathroom was dirty, and when we tried to open the sliding glass door in came off of the track and almost fell over the balcony. The place smelt like sewage! The pool was dirty and had stuff floating around in it. Our room was never serviced. The front desk was rude and charged us a &quot;resort fee&quot; on the day we left...this place was the opposite of a resort. The Dan Marino Restaurant was okay minus the slow service. The bell boys were the ONLY good thing about this place. They were helpful in getting us rides and holding our luggage when needed. You couldn't pay me to go back!"
85,372,"May 12 2009	Certainly Good Value - Well Happy	Me and my adult son stayed in a room here when we went over for a boxing match and we were well happy with it. Ok, if I took my wife to Vegas she'd want to go to somewhere a bit more 'swanky' but I was well impressed with Hooters for the price. We paid for the cheapest of rooms (bungalow) and then tipped the reception guy well for an upgrade and ended up with a tower room with Strip view. A couple of small marks on the carpet is the only fault I could find with the room and otherwise it was ideal for us. A 5 night stay cost us under 200 and so less than 40 a night, 20 per person. That's value in my book. The casino is only small by Vegas standards but one advantage was the waitresses on the casino floor soon get to recognise you and know you're a resident, in which case they're well free and easy with the drinks. You don't even have to be actually playing a table or a machine and they'll bring you whatever you ask for. Dan Morhino's Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment frankly - nothing more than average. However, it was my first introduction to the Hooters Restaurant and their variety of hot chicken wings, fries with chilli con carne and cheese etc. Delicious! I'd definitely go back here and all the staff were perfectly helpful, albeit we didn't have any specific problems. Great location too - right end of the Strip for all the action and directly opposite the main entrance to MGM Grand, which is where our Boxing match was. I give Hooters 9/10 overall, provided you always know it's pretty damn cheap and you're not expecting to be treated like royalty for that price!"
86,372,"May 10 2009 	So-so room rude personnel	Booked the Hotel online and we selected the Tower rooms, room was spacious and acceptable for the price. Registration personnel was rude. Unreasonable deposit requested at check-in to cover eventual damages to the room and walking around and see all these drunk people we figured out why."
87,372,"Apr 28 2009 	HOOTERS HOTEL is # 1	Its very hard to find a hotel that is so inexpensive in the strip or near the strip. I did some serious research and found out that the Hooters Hotel is next to the MGM Grand Hotel, right across from each other. I was sick of paying for taxi cabs in Vegas. I decided to walk from Hooters to anywhere in the strip which was fun because you walk through hotel to hotel which isn't bad at all. The price is super cheap, the rooms are comfortable. The rooms are always clean, you can ask for queen beds which they give you two of them. There is 25 cent wings from 12 midnight to 5 a.m. at Dan Marino's. The wings are big and breaded which is a plus and taste awesome. So why pick Hooters, if your a person that is all about not being complicated by your hotel and walking a lot you should come to Hooters. In Vegas your goal is not to spend a lot of time in your hotel but to go to clubs or check out the nice hotels and use the money you saved on the clubs you want to go to. The poker room is amazing being a $1-2 table. The sports room is small but you can place sporting bets which is nice meaning they have that. The girls that work there look great, they really stand out. Hooters is a great headquarters to where you can eat and sleep there but then go out and party in the big hotels and clubs and come back to a relaxing quiet hotel. You will not find any hotels on the strip that come close to price and hospitality as to the Hooters Hotel. Just remember the hotel is small but that make you their primary focus. They have fun card games, they offer comps if you earn them. Hooters Rewards have a coupon sheet given to new Owl Rewards members which is awesome. You can hang out and talk to the pretty girls dealing cards at the hotel, build up your coinfidence and meet other nice ladies throughout the city, its a win win situation. There are plenty of free drinks if you gamble so you have nothing to lose. All these reasons make the Hooters Hotel # 1. Be realistic, stay within your budget, your not going to spend a lot of time in a 4 or 5 star hotel and spend 250 to 300 dollars a night, realize that your playing for what check in at 4 at most 4 or 5 star hotels to leave at 11 or 12 am, thats 20 hours by 300 dollars means your losing 15 dollars a hour or go to Hooters and pay 40 to 80 dollars a night and that works out to 2 to 4 dollars a hour so do the math. I rate Hooters a 3.8 out of 5 stars. Hooters is a hotel that constantly rewards its customers with coupons, comps, and inexpensive food and inexpensive room rates."
88,372,"Apr 26 2009 	Nice beddings	A little bit off the strip, I once went to this casino to walk around and thought it was overrated. Second time around, still think the casino (and the girls!) are overrated. But spending a night in one of their regular rooms-- oh my! I loved the bed room so much! The room we got had great views of Luxor. It had fresh interiors, lighting was nice, and the colors were cheery. The newly renovated pool area looked pretty cool too. Bathroom was a little cramped. The part I loved the most were the sheets... my, oh, my...sheets to sleep in for!Cons: incovenient parking. off stripPros: Bed sheets to die for. Reasonable prices (got our room at a special rate of $25 a night on a weekday). Close enough to the stripWould definitely consider staying again in the future, if only for the price and the sheets."
89,372,"Apr 17 2009 	Absolutely fantastic!	I'd never been to Hooters before, I'd normally stayed at the Luxor or the Venetian but we decided to stay here as we'd heard it was very good, and it was brilliant!Having stayed at whats seen as the 'posher' hotels, I'd say Hooters surpasses them all, the rooms were brilliant and the comfort was fantastic, only 3 minute walk from the main Vegas, situated right outside MGM. The pool was brilliant, we went in December when it wasn't so busy so a late night swim or sit in the Jacuzzi was bliss! Loved every minute of the hotel, well worth the money and will definitely be booking there again!"
90,372,"Apr 14 2009 	This hotel was great	This hotel was great. I did not expect much but I was surprised. The room was a good size with comfortable beds and all the needed amenities including safe, iron, but no coffee maker. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels and products. In general, it would compare it to any other 3 star hotels.All employees were easy going and seemed to like working there. No matter who you talked to there was no attitude. Unlike the larger casinos on the strip, people seemed to be having fun in the Casino. The pool bar was fun and Dan Marinos had top quality food at a reasonable price. Dixies Dam Bar was kind of weak. Although I had a VIP pass that stated free admission they still charged me at the door. The location is great. Its barely off the strip. Actually, parts of MGM Grand are further off the strip then this whole hotel. This is just a nice friendly reasonably priced place. I have stayed at the bigger fancier hotels in Vegas but I will return to this one next time."
91,372,Apr 14 2009 	Great stay in Vegas	Had a Ocean view room on the 15th floor. Overlooked the pool. WEather was decent so some hotties were out but afternoon weather was windy.Rooms were quiet and very clean. No problems with extra noise or drunken partiers. Walls were thick enough to mask most noise.Beds could use an upgrade. Squeeky but OK comfortable.Casino was good and the casino service was adequate. Food (Hooters rest. and Dan Marinos) was good. I would recommend this hotel to anybody. Party people and some families who don't need the &quot;resort&quot; experience.
92,372,"Apr 13 2009 	Awful dirty disgusting Ugh!!!!	Where do I start? We stayed in a bungalow room that faced the pool (instead of the parking lot) which you think would be nice. Well, think again. If you love music at a level 10 from morning until after midnight &amp; the sound of children screaming-this is the room for you. I called the front desk manager (Frank) who told me that the music was only played from 12 noon until 10pm. Well, the next night, the music was on way past 11pm and the manager (some woman) told me, &quot;Oh no, it can go on after midnight, especially on the weekends. I had to leave a note to housekeeping what to clean every day because somehow they missed the mold in the tub, the light bulbs that needed replaced (which never got done) and to unclog the tub. And God forbid they leave you more than one roll of toilet paper in the room. One on the spinner, that is all you get. We had to let the shower run about 2 minutes before the hot water ever came on and if anyone in the surrounding rooms is using their shower, forget it-you aren't getting any hot water. 2 of my 5 days, I had to take a shower in the gym locker room to get hot water. There was NEVER any hot water out of the bathroom sink. The site claims that all bungalows come with safes, hair dryers, and coffee makers....No they don't. I had to call for a hair dryer and it's curcuit-clicker on it was a hassle. I had to keep clicking it like a lighter to get it to work. The carpets are filthy. I walked from my room at one end of the hall to the ice machine in my socks. When I got back to the room, they were black. I accidently locked myself out of my room. When security showed up, they didn't have me listed as being in the room at all. The gym is good but there is nothing to clean the equipment with after you are done....gross. The location is the only good part about that place. It's a quick walk to the strip."
93,372,Apr 12 2009 	I would pay more just to stay somewhere else.	Who knows when the room was vacuumed last? Dead bugs and old clothes labels littered the floor. The carpet looked like the original  from quite some time ago. The toilet bubbled up sewer gas periodically (including through the night). We had 4 in the room but did not have enough towels. When I went down first thing in the morning to request more towels  I was told that they would be up shortly  they never arrived. The only saving grace was that the afternoon desk supervisor (Frank) actually allowed me to cancel our second night  now I just have to try and get that money back from Travelocity! I will never stay there again.
94,372,"Apr 8 2009 	OK for the cost	We paid $25usd per night. The room was spacious. The linen was a bit old and tatty. The staff at reception were not rude but not loverly either. The casino floor is small but always had some action. $3 blackjack tables were great. It took 10 minutes to walk up to New York New York. If you can get a cheap room it is a decent place to put your bags, sleep and shower."
95,372,"Apr 7 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	We stayed three nights, Friday - Sunday, through a booking with Travelocity. We typically stay downtown so we are not what you would call high-maintenance hotel people.We had a non-smoking room on the 4th floor of the Oceanview Tower which had a view of the Strip (odd numbered room). I thought the room was clean and the bed was firm and comfortable. There always seemed to be plenty of hot water available and we never had to wait long for an elevator.The pool area was quite nice but you start to lose the sun at around 3PM. There was a security guy at the pool area, but we never had to show our room card or anything.We loved the small size of the hotel/casino. Being just off the Strip made it much easier to get to and from by car.I will say this, the hotel room walls are wafer thin. I could hear the guy next door to us get his morning phone call from his wife clear as a bell."
96,372,"Apr 5 2009 	Crappy room	The rooms, hallways, and elevators are filthy and run down. The room smelled and was dirty. The hotel does have a nice pool and is in a convenient location near MGM, New York New York and Tropicana."
97,372,"Mar 27 2009 	nice choice	MinusHotel smell a bit and look dirty, Internet not reliable and not free, window was not locking.PlusIs not dirty, people are friendly and helpful, nice location, nice food, EXTREMELY CHEAP, comfortable, nice room service, clean room and shower and WC, hot water 24/7RECOMMENDED!"
98,372,"Mar 27 2009 	Great Value; Very Good pool/area; great location; non-typical Vegas rooms	The bungalows are going for $24.95 a night + $5 resort fee; Rooms are small and more like a motel than your typical Vegas strip room. Location is great... right across from MGM and 1 min from monorail.Casino is very small - but fun. Outside Pools and area are great.If you want to get to Vegas; have fun; not worry about all the amenities of a $300 room....and find a great value on our room (so you can spend your money on shows, casinos, et al... this is the place for you.My wife and I have been here 3-4 times over that past couple decades... and stayed in the top end places and now Hooters.... we had a blast in all of them. Just know what you want and what you're paying for and everything will be great.have fun.they have hi-speed internet, but charge $12.95 a day for use"
99,372,Mar 25 2009 	Not a bad hotel for the price.	My husband and I went to Las Vegas last year and wanted to stay in a cheaper priced hotel but didn't want something junky so I started looking up reviews on hotels. I read the reviews on the Hooters Hotel and Casino and they seemed pretty decent. We booked the room at only $35/night. I was actually surprised. It wasn't a fancy hotel or romantic which we were not expecting but for the price it was comfortable and clean. The elevators were a little scary. They sounded like they might fall apart at any given time and I really didn't care for the casino there but I'm not a big gambler. Their promotional slot machine dollars they give you don't get you much. I never really saw anybody winning anything. But all in all it was a nice stay. We would stay there again. I will say it is probably for a younger croud though.
100,372,"Mar 23 2009 	Small fun close to the strip - great place to stay	Let me begin by saying that if you want to stay in a ritzy, ultra-classy hotel then this is not the place for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for an inexpensive room in a fun hotel/casino that you are not likely to get lost in, this is your place. It is a small, fun hotel and casino with brightly colored lights, fun music and a party atmosphere all around. The whole hotel is a bit reminiscent of a beachy/surfer atmosphere down to the surfboards hanging on the walls and the &quot;sandy footprints&quot; in the hallways.My trip was a 5 day stay from Wednesday through Monday during Spring Break/March Madness so the city was hopping. I went with three college friends and even with being four 20-something girls staying at Hooters, we had a blast and really enjoyed the hotel. We also felt extremely safe, as we had difficulty with an obnoxious drunk guy harassing one of our friends one night. The security, casino, and hotel staff were wonderful and took care of it immediately. The room cost us $39 (Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights) to $99 per night (Friday and Saturday nights).The rooms were nothing terribly special, similar to a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel chain you might stay at (also similar to your average room at Excalibur, Tropicana, etc) but the room was clean, the beds were comfortable, in-room safe was provided, and our view was of the south end of the strip - NYNY, Exalibur, Mandalay Bay, the Luxor, the MGM, and the Tropicana and was stunning at night. Some people say this hotel is off-strip and technically it is, but it is basically like being on the strip. It is next door to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM grand - it is about the same walking distance to the strip as from either of those places once you account for the fact that both of those casinos are much larger and it takes a long time to get to your room once inside. We had friends staying at Excalibur and the Tropicana, and it didn't take us any longer to get back to our room from an activity than it did for them. The pool was warm - a bit small, but fun and PACKED when we were there. It was definitely a party atmosphere in the pool area, lots of people in our age range and high-energy music playing. The pool bar (nippers) served great frozen drinks and there was towel service. In the casino, all of the dealers (a mix of Hooters girls and regular dealers) were friendly and helpful. The casino is small, but laidback and fun and a good place to wind down the evening. Everything is decorated in bright lights and light pine and the music is always jamming. The only real complaint we had was about the restaurant (not the Hooters one) - we went for brunch our second day and the service was slow and the food overpriced. I like to stay in a new place everytime I go to Vegas, but if I got a good deal here I would go back."
101,372,"Mar 22 2009 	Clean Room - LOOSE Slots	We booked this because the last time we were in Vegas, we kept winning on the slots in Hooters. We read the Trip Advisor reviews and booked through the Hooters Casino website and got a great deal. We were not expecting JW Marriott or Ritz Carlton. Our room was clean, comfortable (bed was a pillow top), quiet and close to the elevator and right next door to the ice machine. Never heard a peep except for the loud lady across the hall slamming her door a few times. Didn't notice an visible remodeling but don't have anything to compare to as this was our first stay. Everything was in good shape in our room...some warn spots on the chair but HEY IT's A HOOTERS Hotel..what do you expect? SLOTS WERE LOOSE. My sister's boyfriend won $1200 within the first 12 hours we were there. Marino's Restaurant has a great breakfast buffet..timing is everything.. food goes quick and you have to wait for more fresh food. Take advantage of the Owl Rewards Club upon arrival. We got two great coupon books and ate breakfast half price for two days. Regular portions off the menu for breakfast included alot of food! When checked out, my husband and I both got money back from playing on the slots. The Main bar in the front of the casino was slow. Waited a long time for drinks but the cocktail girls on the casino floor were quick and nice. Front desk staff was pleasant. Ask for a free upgrade for a room with a view. Pool area nice with palm trees. Too cold to swim but there were fire pits. Casino is close to MGM and New York New York. Lots of visible security Will stay again. (One strange thing did happen...when I was cashing my Owl Rewards in, the guy waiting on me passed out and fell back and hit his head on the counter behind him. The female staff member standing to his left didn't even flinch. I was &quot;Hey this guy just passed out&quot; she said &quot;It's happened before. &quot; Very non-chalant. The other employee working the desk on the other side of the guy who passed out called security. It took forever for someone to come and the whole time, this guy is on the floor, glasses broken, eyes closed and not one person had bent down to help him or even check to see if he has swallowed his tongue or if his head was bleeding. Very freaky....I was scared for this guy. He finally sat up when security came and he seemed okay. The ambulance arrived as we were getting in our cab. I sure hope he's okay. Older guy 60-ish.)"
102,372,"Mar 21 2009 	Loved it Loved it Loved it!!	My husband and I decided to make a quick trip to Las Vegas kind of spur of the moment. Got a FABULOUS rate at Hooters and thought why not. We appreciated the smallness of it all. We could make it from our bungalow room to the front door in two minutes. Some of the bigger hotels in Vegas take you 20 minutes to do so. Our bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and spiffy. It is a quick walk to the strip. Staff was friendly and helpful. The pool was unintimidating and relaxing. Having stayed at 5 other hotels on the strip, I would definitely consider staying at Hooters again!"
103,372,"Mar 18 2009 	Don't stay here if you have breathing problems	The hotel and staff were all great, lots of sexy beautiful women. Room really nice. A little noisy from some ignorant guests one of the three nights, they need some signs up asking for guests to be quite at certain hours. Everywhere on the first floor stunk of cigarettes, even inside of restaurant. If hotel was non-smoking would go back in a second but no where in Vegas is, will never go back to Vegas because of this reason, couldn't enjoy ourselves(still choking a week later). Paid a high rate for first 2 nights due to Nascar but on the return got an incredible deal."
104,372,"Mar 16 2009 	Place is trashy but hey for the price you can't expect more!	This place is OK! Rooms aren't terrible but they are not great. I found them to be clean enough, but the halls had a bit of a smell. The shower didn't work very well and yes, you can hear everything in the halls and next door. But Hey, you aren't in your room that much.I would only recomend this hotel for a younger, single crowd, definately don't bring your Girlfreind or Wife here, they will probably not be too comfortable in the rooms.The place definately has a Party vibe, and I found the Casino to be preety low key and fun! Always easy to get your free drinks while gambling, unlike the big hotels where you are lucky to get a dring every 40 min if you are lucky.The Pool area is OK to relax at but $6.00 a beer.All in all, I would say this place is OK, but would not go back. A little more money will get you a big upgrade!Derek"
105,372,"Mar 14 2009 	Hooters is not for party poopers	Hooters is indeed a busy hotel, it was fun staying there as we got to meet new people, also have a friend who works their who tells me that once clocked in they are on the go from the start time. Hooters prices were reasonable so could not complain about that, the only thing that got my goat was the room was a bit muffy as though the sheets had not been changed in over a week apart from that I would recommend the hotel....the staff were superb, very friendly...I felt as though I'd known some of them for years."
106,372,"Mar 12 2009 	Great location and great chicken wings!!!	This is my 4th visit to Vegas and everytime i go I try stay at a different hotel. Although the building it has gone thru some serious changes I can honestly say i was not impressed. It all depends on what you are looking for, in my honest opinion and in comparison to the other hotels it looks tired and run down. As all my other reviews, as long as the bed is clean and an hot water is available I am happy and since i got a great deal thru expedia I cannot complaint. However if you are used to more formal and structured hotels and resorts I do not recommend it. Having worked in the Hotel industry it can be a bit of a shocker as there is no formal lobby. The reception area is flushed to the left and not visible as the casino floor is immediately in front of it, I figured that the check in agents would have been HOOTER girls, sadly it wasnt, far from being hooter girls, there is plenty of then in the casino but none behind the front desk. (guess it would be too sexist)None the less like i said the room was good size, the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. (safe in the room and iron and ironing board) Never took advantage of the pool since it was too cold to enjoy outdoor activities but looked good from my bedroom window. Only complaint i have is that the housekeeper forgot to take out the trash on the first day, and the hostess of the restaurant was miserable, we got there at 12:35 pm to go for breakfast on Sun morning and she did not even look up, all she said was that the buffet was cleared and when we pointed out the info in the elevator all she said was that they were old and have not been updated, but apart her everyone else was pleasant.I will recommend this place as long as you are not looking for fancy decor, fine dinning, if you are in the mood for a good burger w/ fries, chicken wings and a cold beer its awesome! as long as you are willing to share the room with 21 yr old frat boys out to play....lol"
107,372,"Mar 10 2009 	Good Beer 	You deserve better!The wings are good, the waitresses are sweet. But the owner/managers should get out of the business because this place is dirty and falling appart.The scoop: 2 of the 3 Jacuzzis are ice cold., The third has no bubbles and a broken timer switch. Not only an electrical hazzard, but a slap in the face!ALL of the pool area lounge chairs are filthy dirty with large black stains like something that came out of a dumpster. Dirty used pool towels laying all over the place, no pool attendent or anyone on site to clean up the place. Looks like a frat party took place two days earlier and no one cleaned up.My advice: Don't stay here. Call in for the wings, pick em' up and run back to Motel 6, its cleaner.M~"
108,372,"Mar 9 2009 	Cheap place to stay	My husband and I have stayed at this hotel and it was pretty nice for the price so we decided to stay again because it was so cheap. On Saturday our rate was only $79, Sunday was $39 and Monday and Tuesday the rate was only $29/night. Everyone is complaining about how its now perfect but I look at it that I just got to take a vacation for dirt cheap. If you want something spectacular then maybe you should stay that the Wynn. We booked a bungalow but when we were checking they had none available so they upgraded us to the tower. I didn't find anything different between the rooms except the tower has a view. I had no problem with my stay. You have to remember that you are staying at HOOTERS!! I will stay here again just because I know it's cheap and I'm not in my room very much so why pay alot for something your not using very much."
109,372,"Mar 6 2009 	Bed Bug Bites at Hootters	Get another hotel if you can.. This Hooter hotel is dirty, Beds are over-used, un-sanitized, rooms are smelly, elevators don't work most of the time, I paid $100 a night that supposedly in the tower...they book me to this room 202 that has the ceiling and wall joints cracked open you can hear the room next door like without walls. 3 days stay I got Bed Bug Bites all over my neck, arms and back. Managers/employee are rude. And by the way, READ THOSE FINE PRINTS THEY ASK YOU TO SIGN."
110,372,"Mar 6 2009 	Inspiration to stay away from the room as mcuh as possible	OK the price reflects the Hotel. It was cheap we got a great deal, but we paid for it. The room had paper thin walls, it was not very clean and it really inspired us to leave the hotel as much as possible. The location is great because you have easy access to other places in Vegas so you do not have to stick around the Hotel. It was a short walk to nicer Hotel Casinos like MGM, New York New York, Tropicana.... It was also a short walk to a bus stop for the Duece.I did find it interesting that the advertise $3 blackjack 24/7. Now, they do not claim that it is 24 hours in a row. So, do not make my mistake and assume that there will be a $3 table. Plus if there is one open, (and only one) then it is too crowded to get a seat. If you do not want to relax in your room, and want to use it as a place to shower and drop off your bags, this is the place. If you enjoy a good night sleep, this is not the hotel for you."
111,372,"Feb 28 2009 	Perfect for bachlors not for bachlorettes	For my friends 30th birthday we selected Hooters for the cheap price, and relaxed yet different atmosphere it advertised. However after 3 nights there, I was happy to return home. I selected the tower room hearing it was nicer than the free room, and it reminded me of a cheap Motel 6 room from the 80s. The furniture mimics the Hooters resturant, with the orange lamps and official Hooters magazine on the desk with suggestively posed Hooters girls throughout it. Although advertised as Floridan style, the fake palm tree and bedspread were probably the nicest attractions in the rooms. The artwork is guy related with Hooters bar paintings and boats. Stains litter the hallway and bedroom rugs. One of my plug outlets didn't work, and although Hooters website says coffee makers are included in the room you have to request it. I requested mine 5 times over the course of 2 days, 4 times by phone and 1 time at the main desk. You can hear everyone's conversations as you walk by their rooms. The ultimate kicker was that the website states the tower rooms have a view of the strip. Well mine.. was the view of the airport landing strip. The plus is that Dan Marino's resturant is excellent and if you want some &quot;Coyete Ugly&quot; dancing and drinking try out Dixie's which you will be sure to get a free admission card from the guys advertising the bar outfront in the lobby. In retrospect I can see where the hotel is a great idea for bachlor events or a guy outing, however for the girls I suggest avoiding this one."
112,372,"Feb 23 2009 	Moderate maybe two and half stars	I read all the reviews on trip adivsor and from what I had read it sounded like Hooters was the best place to stay on a budget. Right now they are offering an free upgrade from a bungalow to a standard room which was good because the outside of the bungalows looked like they were hourly rooms to rent seen on COPs. The Standard room was okay. It was large and the bed was comfortable but lights didn't work, the bathroom tile was chipped, and you had to call housekeeping to request whatever was missing from the room such as ice container and coffee maker. I was on the 10th floor in the Bay View tower which over looked the airport and the Extended Stay America and Motel Six and I kid you not every day there were four cop cars over there busting people. It was good entertainment but was a little worriesome. The SASS spa was great. The people there were very friendly. The hooters girls were also really nice. Actually the all of the staff were great. The hotel its self would be good for college, single aged friends to stay at because if you don't spend a lot of time in your room you would be happy. Overall, I wouldn't stay there again but if my son wanted to go to vegas with his friends, I would put him up there."
113,372,"Feb 20 2009 	We actually had a great time here.	I was pretty skeptical of this hotel at first, partly because of the bad reviews I had seen other people write and partly because I am a 28 year old female who was traveling with her boyfriend and friends. BUT....This hotel is a GREAT value. I loved the atmosphere here, which is beachy, tropical and laid back. Yes, the casino is small, but I actually kind of liked that. The cocktail waitresses paid attention to me, even at the 3 dollar blackjack table. It's within walking distance of the MGM Grand, Excalibur and New York New York. The Owl Rewards Club we signed up for was pretty decent on the comps. We got a little orange book full of comps, but only used the 2 for 1 breakfast buffet, $100 in free slot play, and free tickets to see The Mentalist. Not a bad place, despite it's bad rap. I'd reccommend this place!"
114,372,"Feb 12 2009 	Clean and Close - Good Value	The hotel is located just off the strip near MGM Grand. The room was about average. It was clean, however, it took them till 11 pm to get my room cleaned on Monday and they acted like this always happens. The walls are paper thin and if you get noisy neighboors it will be a problem. If you complain to the staff they will take care of it as they did with my friends that were staying on another floor. Would strongly recommend joining there rewards program. It is free and the coupons alone are worth it. We saw both shows they offer for free with the coupons and both are very good."
115,372,"Feb 9 2009 	Disgusting!!	This &quot;remodel&quot; is [--]. This is the most disgusting hotel i've ever stayed at, everything was dirty the bathroom floor was really sticky, the bathtub had nasty hair in it. Also the toilet was like six inches off the floor it was made for kids. The walls are paper thin you can hear EVERYTHING your neighbor is talking about or doing. I'm very disappointed. If you plan on drinking expect cheap alcohol for a expensive price. The girls also look cheap."
116,372,"Feb 1 2009 	Great Again	We stayed at Hooters January 24-27; this was our third trip to this hotel and we had a great time. We arrived before noon and got into our room right away. The room was clean and very comfortable. The bathrooms are a bit dated, but very clean. Everyone we encountered during our trip from the front desk, the Owl Club desk and all waitresses and bartenders were very friendly; the service was outstanding. The location of the hotel is convenient to the strip. We are planning to go back again next year."
117,372,"Jan 25 2009 	Pleasently Surprised Very clean!	We have stayed at Hooters on Jan 16-20. The hotels is located just a little bit on the side from the strip. It was very easy to access the strip and we walked many times during the day and night. At times when we got tired we took the bus that runs on the strip, and it stops at the Excaliber hotel which is practically across the street from Hooters. The hotel itself was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Our room was on the 10th floor and faced the pool....very nice view compared to the views that hooters can offer. The service staff was very friendly. We arrived around 1030am, and a room was already ready for us. Check in didnt take more than 5 min. The breakfast buffet is alright. It is located in another restaurant not the Hooters one. If you get the coupon book with your &quot; hooters rewards&quot; card, you pay 10$ for 2 people...so you cant really expect 5 star meal for 5 dollars a person.On our third morning, we didnt have a coupon to use for the buffet, but the waiter was kind enough to &quot;find&quot; an extra coupon in his pocket. We didn't try the restaurant for any other meals so i can not comment on that. The food at Hooters restaurant is your average american food. We went to the Mentalist show that the hotel gives you a free ticket to. (well you technically pay 9.95$ per drink per person, so we paid about 19$ for the two of us for the show) The show is entertaining and we actually had a good laugh out of it too. Would recommend!The casino is very small compare to other hotels, bets are low and it was enjoyable for us. We spent a lot of time there and the dealers are friendly. Overall i would stay at the hotel again. BTW, when you check out they will charge you an additional 21$ fee for the pool, gym, and something else. So be prepared to see that on your credit card even if you book this hotel from a website."
118,372,"Jan 22 2009 	Comfortable 	Five of my friends and I went to Vegas this past weekend for a mini reunion. We wanted to stay somewhere on the strip, somewhere clean (they had a bad experience with Circus Circus before), and affordable. Since we wouldn't spend much time in the room, we didn't really need a fancy hotel room. The Hooters staff (boys and girls) were all very hospitable and friendly. Checking in and out was simple, and the front desk staff was very helpful when we needed some recommendations. We stayed on the 8th floor of the tower (not facing the strip), and it was beautiful in the morning, looking over the pool area and we got to see the mountains. Dan Marino's 24 hour fine dining inside the hotel was pretty good. I'd recommend joining the Owl Rewards Club (free) and you'll get a coupon book. Within it, you'll find a BOGO free breakfast buffet ticket. That was the best meal of the whole trip, and it was only $5! The ONLY thing that was funny or weird was the smell that came up from the pool area to our balcony ... cheeseburgers and fries. If that's a smell that you don't enjoy, then request a room in the other tower, haha. We didn't mind it though. It was more entertaining than anything. We'll definitely stay there next time we head out to Vegas."
119,372,"Jan 19 2009 	Bugs on my face yes BUGS	A now ex-boyfriend took me here over the last summer. I saw multiple cockroaches crawling around outside the restaurants and rooms on property. I found multiple crickets in my room, even one crawling across my face in the morning. Two calls to room service on two different days ended in wrong information, no delivery, and wrong food. The massages were ok, as expected but the &quot;spa&quot; is pretty lame. The location is at least close to the strip. The rooms are very old, so do not expect much. I tell everyone I know to avoid this place, I suggest you do too unless you like lounging by the pool with the stereotypical &quot;trailer trash&quot; and their rude children."
120,372,"Jan 16 2009 	Exactly What We Wanted	I am still staying here at the hotel, but would like to add my 2 cents. We checked in on a weekday and there was no line at check-in. The agent was friendly and effecient. The casino is a bit small, but we had great luck at the tables and the dealers were very friendly and helpful. Our package included two free breakfast coupons which we used at Dan Marinos. The menu looks like it has changed a bit from the last time we stayed, but our rib favorite was on there. Our favorite part of our trip so far has been the two massages we received at the Salon. It's small, but full service and the girls in there really make you feel welcome. We will definitely be coming back here on our next Vegas trip. The value for our dollar was exactly what we were looking for."
121,372,"Jan 13 2009 	Great time - great price - great location	We really liked Hooters. It was in a great location, pools were nice, nice atmosphere, and great breakfast (Dan Marino's restaurant)."
122,372,"Jan 8 2009 	Best Sevice and Views in Vegas	Wow Great hotel......we had the best service out of any hotel in vegas. the breakfast buffet is okay for the price, if you go to guest services you apply for a club card (it's free) you get a coupon book with some really good deals in it one is 2 for 1 breakfast buffet, it's okay but i wouldnt brag about it. BUT the all you can eat ribs for 17.99 is totally worth it DON'T EAT THE MUFFIN THEY START YOU WITH OR YOU WONT HAVE ROOM FOR RIBS ;)....the wings after midnight are also incredible and the hooters bar is also incredible food....the rooms are VERY clean, and all the staff are VERY friendly. the show with Jerry that plays at night is a must see and if you get that card you also get to take the show in for free yeah that's right free but go early if you want a good seat like 6:15 as the line forms early. he messed big time with my mind and we still talk about it everyday. this hotel is a great deal and it's right across the street from MGM and next to Tropicana. enjoy your stay!"
123,372,"Jan 4 2009	Truly a Dump!	I booked 2 rooms for Dec. 30, and 31st, and I was thankful the MGM was right across the street. The place is a daycare center, nothing but early 20-somethings. I'd been here a few years ago when it first opened and they actually were trying, now it's quite clear the management has no interest. The table games suck, most of the players have no idea how to play, so if you like at least somewhat of a semblance of a blackjack game go elsewhere ($5 to $10 minimums). The maid worked hard and the waiter in Marino's was friendly and efficient. Walk fast through the casino after your shower so you don't have the lingering scent of chicken wings. I'm not a snob, but there are so many other places in Vegas to stay. Don't waste your time here. Delightfully tacky, yet unrefined is an understatement, this is not the cure for the common casino.....the common casino is much better! The hookers don't even work this place!!!!"
124,372,"Dec 30 2008	Fun and great location!	We drove into Vegas and did not have a reservation on December 25, 2008. We knew that Hooters had a great deal on prices and we knew the location was right across the street from all types of conveniences. We checked in for 2 evenings and we were very surprised by the young vibe and great energy. Our room was clean and spacious. We did eat at the restaurant, Hooters, which was consistent as all Hooters Restaurants are. Our heater, it was very cold, rainy and windy that evening, was not working great and was a bit noisy but we were too tired to deal with it. The next day we called downstairs about the heater and they sent up a wonderful maintenance man, who immediately responded to the call, and he fixed the heater. Well that didn't last as the barrings had gone on the heater, so they moved or I should say they upgraded us to the SUITE! 2 full bathrooms, master bedroom, livingroom, wetbar, 2 plasmas. The front desk told us they wanted us to fully enjoy our stay and apologized for any inconvenience. The staff was very kind and personable. We loved that we could walk across the street to any casino, show, the metro, shops, etc."
125,372,"Dec 27 2008 	Never thought I'd stay here.	After the airline changed my flight, I needed a place to stay for one more night. I booked Hooters through Hotels.com because it was cheap and close to the airport. I just wanted to stay the night and get out early. I ended up with a Bungalow room out by the pool. This would have been great in the summer, but meant nothing since it was cold in Vegas at the time. I did not see an elevator, so I had to carry my bag up the one flight of stairs. (ok, so a guy was nice enough to carry it for me.) The room was clean and comfortable. I can't say anything bad about the place. The heat worked, so that was a plus. If you have trouble sleeping, I guess you wouldn't want to be this close to the airport, but I wasn't bothered by the noise at all. Hooters charges a $5.45 resort fee (parking, telephone &amp; pool) on top of what Hotels.com charged, but I wasn't going to complain. I took the shuttle r/t from the airport and was the first one off, last one on on the two trips. I probably wouldn't stay here again because I'm not crazy about the location."
126,372,"Dec 25 2008 	You get what you pay for!	I guess you get what you pay for with Hooters. I paid 35 dollars a night- plus a 6 dollar (resort fee) for parking which I didn't use becuase I used Public Transportation, and a pool that wasn't even open! But coming from New England that is penuts compared to what Hotels cost around here - so I'm not complaining about that. My complaint is with the whole &quot;Vegas Strip&quot; in general, much prefer the Downtown Area over the &quot;Strip&quot;, and will be staying downtown next time at either Binions, Golden Gate, Fitzeralds, Golden Nugget, Four Queens Etc, all which were excellent! But do stay stay away from El Cortez, it is as shady as the reviews say. Downtown is much more friendly to people who are on some type of budgets. I was able to find decent Poker and Craps games in comfortable atmosphere's at the above mentioned Casinos on Fremont St. Also the people are more friendly all around, and there is a great cigar shop, souviener shops, and plenty of excitement in a safe atmosphere on Fremont St!  As for Hooters, I will not be staying there again- it was just too mediocre for all the great places in Vegas, there are much better places than Hooters even for the budget minded traveler."
127,372,"Dec 23 2008 	Dirty roomspoor service .	Stayed 2 nights in Dec,08.Front desk staff rude and disinterested on check in.room was dirty with mold and rust in bath tub,carpet old dirty and smelly.My non smokeing room stunk of smoke and heater unit was so noisy I had to turn it off to sleep.20 minutes to cash a travelers check at desk with photo id.When I had dinner in the Hooters restaurant in the hotel tried to charge meal to my room and photo id was demanded again even though I had a key card and was a registered guest.Pool area was closed due to snow but was charged resort fee even though pool area was not usable,they would not reverse this charge.would not recommend or stay again."
128,372,"Dec 22 2008	The casino was better than I expected	First of all, we did not stay here at this hotel but we did visit the casino, which was fine.Everyone seems to complain about the $100 promotion that you have to play at a set of roped-off slot machines. My hubby hated this, but I actually liked it. Of course, he was out in a short time and I was able to play and get drinks for quite a while. Also, the lady next to me won some money on this so I know that it is possible to win. Basically, if you want a very slim chance of winning with no money invested and still receive drink service, this is not a bad promo. I got pretty good drink service here, but my husband really went through the money and had a hard time finding a waitress to get him a drink once he was done with the promo. I think it was worth a try."
129,372,"Dec 20 2008 	Cheesier Than Cheez Its	I was within a hundred yards of this hotel (Hooters, Las Vegas) and knew I had made a huge mistake by booking two nights here on a business trip. The place is run down, poorly maintained and filthy. They must have layed off there maintenance and housekeeping staff. The place looked like it hdn't been painted in 10 years, cheesy orange chipped paint all over the place with a drab gray paint on the building. Rotting wood and elevators that had graffiti and smelled awful. All of this before I ever got in the place. The check in staff are all kids with major attitudes. Going to my non-smoking room I found black grease in the sink and tub. The shower still had pubic hair in there from the previous guests. I found out why, it was because of the poor drainage in the tub itself. A 10 minute shower left me with water up over my ankles. The towels all smelled like cigarette smoke and the blanket under the comforter had dried blood on it. My room had a locked connecting door to a second room in it and I spent my first night listening to a couple getting it on through paper thin walls. I ordered a Philly Cheese steak sandwich at the Hooters Bar and it gave me food poisioning. Need I say more....Oh, their $100 free play money was also a joke...you can only use your $100 on pre-selected $5 slot machines and you cant win money unless you earn 17000 points, then you get $50 bucks. Save yourself some anguish, dont stay at this place...there's only so far you can rest on a trademark of girls in skimpy low class outfits."
130,372,"Dec 12 2008 	Good location and good price	I had read a lot of bad reviews so I was a little afraid but went there with an open heart. We had booked the cheapest category but got upgraded directly to Ocean view which I guess is the best category.We got a quite large double room with a great view of some of the large hotels at the strip. The beds were comfortable and especially the pillows. The room and the hallways are a little worn down but not that much that I thought about it.The casino is small but okay for just hanging out a bit before hitting the strip. The location is really super, very close to the airport...a cab takes 5 min and costs like 13 dollars. Walking from the hotel you are on the strip in 5 minutes, inside MGM in 3 minutes and it is also located just by a small supermarket if you need to buy sodas or stuff.We paid 28 dollars a night and for that price it is a supergood value."
131,372,"Dec 12 2008 	Sedsy's Hooters Review	We had been discussing going to Vegas for a while and I somehow managed to find a cracking return flight and hotel package.To keep costs down we decided to stay at hooters hotel as they gave us the 5th night for free.I waited all year to go on the trip to Vegas and in terms of my expectations to be honest I was expecting to simply sleep at Hooters and not really do anything else there. I didnt expect anything from this place at all, maybe it was unfair to jugde before I got there. After a Long and mingin flight, when the plane finally landed at the airport you could see the hotel which certainly didnt look to impressive due to the fact you have the monster of the MGM Grand directly behind it. But the look form the outside should not be taken into account as it is inside where the Hotel really impressed me and was well beyond my expectations when I booked.The Main floor has a decent sized Casino complete with Roulette, craps, Blackjack, poker and good selection of Slots to gamble 11 months worth of savings away, GET IN.The rooms are clean i'd probly compare them to a Travel Inn or Travelodge or similar back in the UK. The rooms are themed in a tropical style with a good selection of TV channels, a good sized bathroom with powerful shower, a electronic safe (crucial so you dont take your full wedge out with you and blow it on Black on the roulette).The only downside was our view as we got the airport, but to be honest it wasnt load enough to wake you as the airport seems busier in the day anyway, but if you are a plane spotter this room would be great for you.But again I didnt go Vegas to look out me room and admire the view, i went up the stratosphere for that.The hotel has a good sized pool area with an outdoor pool bar. The food and drink facilities were also better than expected here with A Dan Marinos Restaurant, a hooters and a couple of bars including the notorious dixies country bar with its $1 Bud light drafts and free for birds between 7-10pm wednesday and thursday.If you are going to vegas on budget I would certainly recommend this Hotel, it offers a good room in a good location to access the Strip and others hotels. I certainly would stay here again in the future. If you are going with a group of lads or a younger crowd of people this would be a great place to stay. I've stayed in plenty of hotels in different places in america and Europe and I have certainly stayed in worse places and paid more for the pleasure."
132,372,"Dec 11 2008 	Loved Hooters	I recently stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino the first week in December. I was with my spouse and 5 other couples. We have stayed there in the past when the property was the San Remo, and found it to be convenient and nice place to stay and we like the location, so we thought we'd give Hooters a try. We were very impressed with the &quot;makeover&quot; to the casino, lobby, and bar and restaurant and pool areas. The place was filled with &quot;regular&quot; people like us, in Vegas for the National Finals Rodeo and enjoying this small casino and hotel on a &quot;budget. All of the staff and dealers that we met were extremely friendly and the whole place was very comfortable. late at night the casino was busy, but not too crowded, and they played great music, and you could also see great live bands in the Dixie Bar without paying a cover. The rooms were clean and refurbished, and the beds were extremely comfortable ( everyone in our group commented on that) We all had rooms in the Tower areas. There were only a few things which I would consider needing improvement: The carpet in the halls and rooms was not &quot;new&quot; but had been cleaned, but showed it's age. The doorways had some paint chipping and general scuffs here and there in the rooms, but nothing bad where we stayed. The prices have gone up some for food and drinks, since the San Remo days, but so has every place in Vegas. Hooters is still a VERY economical and convenient place to stay. It doesn't take you an hour to get to and from your room, or to make your rounds through the casino to find your friends. The drinks were very good, actually WITH alcohol in them ( unlike some &quot;big&quot; casinos serve) and the pool area was nice and cozy with a hot tub and a fire pit with benches around it. This place is NOT the MGM or the Bellagio, but it's comfortable, and fun. We all said that we would definitely stay there again, it fit the bill for us perfectly!"
133,372,"Dec 9 2008 	Great Low Budget Experience	Once again, my girl and I pack up the car, leave the kid at grandmas house, drop the top on the Eclipse and head for Sin City. This was a pure mental health trip as we both needed a break from work and kids andyou name it! Las Vegas has a good way of balancing things out for us. This trip however, presented a new challenge for usVegas on a budget! Cash was a little tight for this trip, so we split gas with some friends and found a killer deal on a hotel. Hooters Hotel and casino presented the perfect opportunity. As travel professionals, we managed to get the room at half the usual weekend rate. That brought the price down to $100.00 for the weekend, cant argue with that. The dcor at the hotel can most readily be described as a type of Spring Break atmosphere. Amidst the gambling tables and machines is a very welcoming beach atmosphere complete with decorative surfboards, grass skirt style paneling on the walls, palm trees and a beach concert style stage with dance floor. Not particularly incredible to look at, as compared to neighboring hotels, but not bad at all. For the money we paid as well as the money they asked for, Id say it was well worth it. Of course there were the Hooters girls walking around in their tank tops and short shorts, but all done very tastefully, nothing scandalous. That surprised me a bit, I though Hooters in Las Vegas would be way over the top on the T &amp; A scale, but it was very low key and subtle. Theres still plenty of flesh to feast your eyes on if thats what youre after! The rooms were really interesting. The presentation itself follows the rest on the hotel in that Spring Break feel. Theyre very warm and basic, giving the feel of a beach house with bamboo trim on the walls and a hardened wicker cabinet for the TV. The bathroom was standard size, nothing special, however they do provide perhaps the best hotel soap Ive ever used. It didnt leave your skin felling strange at all, very soft. Everything else about the room was great. No bad smells, everything was clean as a whistle, plenty of toiletry items and not a bad view of the pool area.  The elevators may be a little scary for you claustrophobics out there. They were very tight and a little shaky, no big deal though. My girl got a little worried, Were not going to fall are we? Shes a crack up The restaurants were pretty good. Nothing fancy, just what you might expect from a building with the Hooters logo all over it, nice bar and grill atmosphere. The food was really good and moderately priced. The thing that sticks out most in my mind was the fact that their restaurant was open all night. This was perfect after it was too late to venture out and things were closing up. It would have been a long walk from where Hooters is to get to our favorite eateries. Having a 24 hour spot at the hotel that didnt cost and arm and a leg came in handy more than once. This may have been the perfect place to have a low budget Vegas trip without sacrificing the action of being on the strip. Hooters still boasted an on-strip location making things accessible. We had a lovely time without breaking the bank and we didnt have to stay in a dump either. Id certainly recommend Hooters for anyone looking to do Vegas on a modest budget and still be close enough to the action to not have to drive everywhere."
134,372,"Dec 8 2008 	Great Location and Inexpensive	Stayed for four weeknights at the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas in the bungalows which is what we asked for. The location is great, one block from the strip, MGM and the walkovers to NY NY and Excaliber. The rooms are small but clean, housekeeping staff is very nice. Had one small maintenance issue and they came in 10 minutes to fix it. Parking there is easier than most of the very large hotels. Pools are very nice too. If you want luxury like Bellagio or Wynn, this is not the place for you. We get up around 10 or 11 and stay out till midnight or later so as long as the room is clean and fairly comfortable we are fine with it. Would have liked another chair beside the one in the room and maybe a small table, but not complaining. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable. Had the breakfast in Dan Marinos one morning that came with our package. It wasn't the greatest but for comp, it was just fine. We ate the 25 cent wings after midnight one night in Dan Marino's and that was just fine too. There was never any line at the front desk if we needed anything. Heard horror stories at some of the others just about trying to check in at the huge places. I work at a hotel in a resort area and a 600 room place would be considered large but for Vegas, it is small. Makes it more intimate.They charge for wireless internet, but we were on vacation and didn't use it, but most of the other more expensive places charge for this too. It would have been nice and some hotels do this even though they charge for internet access, they let you print up your boarding passes free. Hooters didn't so I paid the $6.95 and the girl in their gift shop was very nice in helping me with the computer to print it out."
135,372,"Dec 6 2008 	My last time staying here	Stayed in this hotel over Thanksgiving and I took advantage of some of the freebies they had offered, ie free breakfast buffet for 2 and $ 200.00 free slot play. Me and my wife ate at the buffet the first morning using the free coupon, it was ok but we could not see going back the next day and spending $9.99 a person on that buffet. It was a combination of ready to serve quick heat food and dry danishes. I have stayed at a Marrott hotel and the &quot;free&quot; breakfast there was much better. The elevators going to the garages were filthy. We didnt even try to eat in the Hooters Restaurant there becouse the last time we were there earlier this summer the service was extremely poor. The second morning we were there the maids were out in the hall in the early morning cleaning the rooms. We left and got back around 4pm and discovered our room wasnt even cleaned. I had to go to the desk, wait in line 20 mins and complain about it. An hour later 2 maids showed up to clean the room. Bottom line,,,,,,,,this is a dated hotel that the Hooters Corp has bought, threw some surfboards in the hall and decorated in wood. Ive been here twice and the service has been poor. My advice is take your money and for about the same price,,,,,usually less,, stay down the road in the Orleans. I will never go back to the Hooters Hotel in Las Vegas and will recommend the same to my family and friends."
136,372,"Dec 3 2008 	Hooters - $1 Dixies draught?! Can't complain	So, a group of us booked a trip to Hooters in January. 10 months down, and we hit Vegas. Hooters of all places!!I thought all a long this deal is too good to be true, and Hooters is going to be a let down. I read some pretty poor reviews, and expectations where certainly not high. But all I wanted was a roof over my head, a clean room, and some reasonable food and service.Firstly the location. I knew it was near to the MGM grand, which is huge, but right on the strip. You are literally 5 minutes walk away from the main strip and have good access to New York New York, MGM, Excalibur and many more hotels. It cost us just $12 from the Airport to the Hotel, and you can see it as you land.Secondly, the staff. 99% of the time great. Everyone was very friendly, and more so with it being Thanks Giving. I find some of the reviews people left saying the staff where moody and bad is probably a reflection on the reviewers personality. The staff where great with me and my friends, always a good morning, and always offering assistance. There was the odd one who was a bit moody, but you get that everywhere. Also on the staff, the Hooters girls got progressively better as the week went on. The girls in Dixies where just phenomenal to look at, and again, very friendly. Food and Drink was very well placed, like it was in most of Vegas. $4 for American beers, and $1 draught at night in Dixies is great value. Even with the weak pound to dollar. We ate in the Hooters restaurant one night, and again, service was great, and the food very good.The room was much more than I expected. We had clean towels every day, a reasonable selection of TV, and it was clean and tidy. Some people must have got a dodgey room, because mine was spot on the mark. If I had one complaint is that you get a 50/50 of what your view is. One side is the strip, one side is Motel 6 and the Airfield. Shame that, but did you come to Vegas to look out your window?!No, the real reason we went to Vegas was to gamble. And while you want to big it up in the big casino's, Hooters is a great place to start and end the night. And as said earlier, the location is spot on near the strip, and near the monorail stations into the middle of the strip also.Overall, did I expect a lot? No. Did it go beyond the expectations? Yes.I would have no problem recommending Hooters to friends, and I would have no problem staying myself their again. The only reason I wouldn't is so that I could see the rest of the fine hotels in Vegas, but when I return if I don't stay at Hooters, I will certainly pay a visit."
137,372,"Nov 29 2008 	Cheezy as expected - but worth the $29 to be less thank a block from the Strip	Check-in staff were not friendly and neither were the lady bartenders (maybe because I'm a girl). The hot tub wasn't so hot, but that allowed me to spend over 3 hours in it getting to know some Brittish guys. Room was about motel 6 quality, and the bathroom had mold in the calk around the bathtub. HOWEVER - I paid $29 for one night - it was well worth the $29 because you are less than a block from the strip!!Stay here if you want to be close to the strip and can't get a room for under $100!"
138,372,"Nov 26 2008	Crap time Hooters style	Having been to Vegas several times, we have never been let down by our hotel standard, not the very top of the range but good, Stratosphere &amp; Sahara. So this time our travel partners booked Hooters! It is well located &amp; not far from the airport or Monorail at the MGM, so it is accessable. It is advertised as a Floridian theme, I never saw grey drab walls inside &amp; out in Florida,dull. The room we had ,621 was of a low standard, stained carpets, poor decor, looking onto the airport flight path with all that take off noise. We had an interconnecting door, so all in 622 could be heard! At some point early morning, 3 am, in 620 either someone was having a ride to heaven or the adult movie was on loud. The walls are so thin, unbelievable.Breakfast another bad experience $9.99, but watch out, juices, toast etc extra. The basic breakfast was a poor selection, but then again it was $9.99! Service was poor, being held waiting for seating when the place was nearly empty was a joke.Waiting staff, bar one lady, was dreadfull, no tips there.The whole place was well below par in every respect. To add insult on check out, we were OK, but our friends were handed a bill for drinks they never had. Someone had charged a large round of 9 Buds &amp; prawn cocktails to their room No. Obviously bar staff did not care to check validty of the order. They did not pay that &amp; await the outcome.When you look at the deals now on in Vegas, in hindsight we should have just turned up &amp; got in the MGM of Venetian as my friends wife wished, plenty of room. Sadly we stuck it out from Monday to departing on Saturday morning,our fault there!!So any one reading this, please, please do not go to Hooters, it is certainly not a Hoot, quite dreadfull.Take care all &amp; do not be Hootered!!!!!Les wilkinson (an un happy Brit Abroad)"
139,372,"Nov 18 2008 	I just can;t reccomend this place	We usually stay at some simple place to save money for other things on our trip. My motto is safe and clean and I am happy. I want to say this was the case here, but can't. The room was smoking even though we asked for nonsmoking. The tub faucets fell off all the time and the room was at best tiddied up like a 14 year old tidy's his room when forced. The hallways weres simply dirty and the elevaters worked only slowly and sometimes. The pluses were it was super close to the strip and other than not being RIGHT ON the strip was super convenient. Being smaller, parking was a breeze and getting to our room took under 5 minutes comparesd to a half hour at some of the big places. Staff were polite and our room for the most part was quiet. In the end though i just can't reccomend it. With all the choices there, you can either stay a bit off the strip and save money for nicer rooms (no big deal if you have a car) or pay maybe 10 to 30 dolllars more a night (things are very competitive now with the market in Vegas) and stay at nicer place on the strip. We dresssed up to go out and felt a bit like freaks going through the casino to the car. It is a very simple casion with casual people. A suit and cocktail dress couple walking through here really stand out."
140,372,"Nov 15 2008 	Good hotel we had a nice stay here.	We stayed here 3 nights at the end of October. Room was big and clean. They gave us clean towels every day and changed the sheets once. The hotel and casino is layed back and there is a lot to do. On certain days ladies drink for free from about 5-11pm in the Dixie bar. You have to take the $200 gameplay you receive with a grain of salt, of course you're not going to win on those machines in the roped off area but hey, just have fun with it for 30 minutes right?Unlike the comment further below, the girls were curvy enough for us and they were all dressed up during halloween. We did not run into any rude staff members at all, everyone was friendly."
141,372,"Nov 13 2008 	Value For the Dollar	I stayed during October 2008.I was looking for an inexpensive room in Las Vegas during the week, this was my choice.The hotel was very clean the room was well furnished, the bathroom was also clean. Only one negative no tissues, but I managed.If I am going to Las Vegas again I will look into Hooters."
142,372,"Nov 10 2008 	Not Too Shabby!	3 Ladies and i went to HOOTERS hotel for a quick,cheap Vegas getaway. The Hotel was okay. Obviously an older hotal that was re-vamped with tropical decor.If you are looking for Clean, Neat and fancy, this isn't the place for you. Bar stools were broken, bathroom counters were stained, the drian in the shower backed up. Other than the above it was pretty decent. After all, it's just a place to sleep after a long day on the strip!We had a Bungalo which is the way to go if you are there in the warmer months. It backs up directly to the pool. Music at the pool turns on around 9:30, which can be annoying.If you are looking for CHEAP, and EASY...Go for HOOTERS!"
143,372,Nov 10 2008 	Thought Hooters was supposed to have women!	I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino for the Hooters experience that I get at my neighborhood Hooters. The majority of the Hooters girl here are frail thin with no curves at all except for the ones that have obviously gone under the knife. Not sure but most of the girls don't look old enough to be working in the casino or serving drinks. No curves at this Hooters. Very disappointing.
144,372,"Oct 24 2008 	Hooters was truly Fantastic	My wife and I stayed for 15 nights recently on our first visit to Vegas from the UK. We were amazed after reading some bad reviews at how fantastic the hotel was! The room was very clean and spacious and the bed was enormous. It was ideally placed both near the airport ($10 in a taxi) and also in walking distance of the strip. While the $200 free slot play is limited to the promotional machines (only a jackpot win pays) we took advantage of the free show and saw the 'Mentalist' Gerry McCambridge. What a fantastic show and completely free, no catches. The pool area was extremely clean and very relaxing, my wife especially enjoyed the hot tubs. The staff were very friendly and we ate in the Hooters restaurant a number of times, on each visit the food and service were excellent. On our last night we paid for a picture with the Hooters girls from the restaurant photographer and she very generously gave us two pictures for the price of one! A tip for others, the Excalibour Hotel offers time share tours with some excellant prizes just for going. We spent 3 hours (yes I know, but as we were there for 15 days it didn't matter really) listening to a woman talk with no intention of buying. At the end we got free Lance Burton tickets (tax had to be paid on them) and 5 x $25 vouchers for food/gambling at the Mandalay Bay, The Luxor, The Excalibour, The MGM Grand or The Mirage. If you can afford to lose a morning and know how to just say &quot;no thank you&quot; then I would highly recommend it (we had three excellent meals and made a profit on our gambling)."
145,372,"Oct 19 2008 	Great room great staff and great surroundings	I stayed at the Hooters and being a travel agent, I hear a lot of positives and negatives about many hotels. I personally stayed in the Hooters and would recommend it to anyone. The staff are super nice and friendly. The beds were comfy and the room was spacious. The best thing and a lot of people notice this, it dosen't take 30 minutes to walk from the front door to the rooms, the casino isn't huge so there isn't a lot to walk through!I look forward to my next stay at the Hooters!"
146,372,"Oct 17 2008 	More than I bargained for	I booked our room late September for our 3 night/4 day stay in Las Vegas because it was such a deal $29 a night. The insane price during Columbus Day weekend was a deal on top of: $200 free slot play, $25 match play @ the tables, free drink @ Dixie's, free breakfast buffet, free night show and more!!!!But I was a little apprehensive AFTER reading all of the reviews. But I figured, if I checked in and it was lousy I knew there would be other options.Figured out that after almost a 5 hour drive from San Diego and arriving at the hotel at 3am, checking in was no problem and we were given a room on the 14th floor in the Ocean Tower. To my surprise the room was big, spacious &amp; clean. There was a stain on the carpet, but I wasn't planning on sleeping on the carpet anyway. Two clean, comfy beds and a decent bathroom. Not to mention my own make up counter next to the minimal closet.It WAS NOT bad at all and I was extremely impressed. It wasn't no Bellagio or Caesar's Palace....but when you're in Vegas all you need is a room to shower and nap in. Who the hell goes there for the rooms?"
147,372,Oct 13 2008 	very good	got a 53.00 per night rate. It really was a good room. I thought it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The place was very quiet at night--it is close to the airport so there was take off and landing noise during the day but no airport noise at night. The casino is fun. The pool area is nice. We would stay here again.
148,372,"Oct 6 2008 	Cockroaches mold and dirty carpets...Oh my!	I booked my room at Hooters Casino Las Vegas for my brother's 21st birthday. The hotel halls were extremely dirty and stained. Once in our rooms, first thing I found on the bathroom floor was a cockroach! (Later another cockroach was found roaming the bathtub.) I was disgusted. Then on further inspection the shower curtain had several mold mounds gowing. I would expect this from some cheap motel but I paid $150.00 per night to stay at this infested hotel. (I think they charge extra for cockroaches and mold.) I travel to Vegas well over 8 times per year and this is the worst hotel I have yet to stay in. Needless to say, my brother's 21st birthday is one to be remembered, just not the Vegas style memory I was hoping for!"
149,372,"Sep 26 2008 	Pleasant stay Not awful Not Excellent	I recently stayed at the Hooters casino/hotel, Was a bit apprehensive at first after reading all the negative reviews bu booked through priceline so it was take it or lose out.Thankfully I was suprised when I got to my room in the tower was a spacious twin room plenty of room and most importantly clean ,didnt see any of the dirt othes mentioned.The pool was great but did tend to get crowded sometimes and I wouldn't like to be in the bungalows with the music on from dawn till dusk, could only slightly hear it in the towers.Found th staff friendly enough but didnt really have loads of dealings with them so cant say how they would have handled any complaints.Oh and the shampoo and conditioner smells really lovely.Its in a good location only a short walk from the tropicana and MGM, the walks prob less than getting out of some casinos from your roomFor the money they charge you get what you pay so dont go in expecting some swanky hotel."
150,372,"Sep 26 2008 	Hooters Restaurant YES - Hooters Hotel NO!	We stayed there the first month it was open and LOVED it! We stayed there again last Saturday, September 20th. This time we didn't. The deterioration was unbelievable. It's pretty obvious that employees really don't care about the facility. The hotel hallways and room carpets were black with dirt. You even saw dirt tracks permanently in the carpeting from luggage. I don't believe they have ever washed the carpets. The maintenance in the rooms were nil. Our bathroom had multiple mold and rust stains, missing shower curtain rings, toothpaste on the front of the sink, dirt in the crevices of the bathroom floor. The room had filthy carpeting and stuck taped paper/toilet paper on the wall over the bathroom door. You couldn't miss it so I find it hard to understand how it could still be there. If you end up in room 839, look up! The slot machine promo is truly a joke as others have said. There are approx 12 machines that are roped off. You stand in line to push a button on a $2.00 machine and you only have 3 winning combinations. I also never saw anyone win anything. I actually won 50.00 in coins which added to my total but I was not allowed to cash out because it was not one of the 3 winning combinations they designated. The comedian was also worthless. Several people walked out of the program out of disguist. Old jokes...I definitely recommend he find some new material. Heard it all before. They could easily upgrade this facility to make it liveable but apparently chose not to. New carpeting, new paint, employ friendly people who take pride in doing a good job. One highlight - the band in Dixie's, the Country and Western Bar, that night. They were amazing and I don't even like CW Music. But, don't stand at the bar. You'll stick to the floor. I walked right out of my shoes the floor was so sticky. My husband and I got a chuckle out of that. Again, we have always loved Hooters Restaurants and plan our vacations around them all over the world. We have a Hooters wall in our bar at home. But, they've really lost it at this facility. They need to make some real changes to bring it back to the standards that make it resideable. It's too bad....we loved it the first time. I would not stay there again without some serious renovation even with the great location and great price!"
151,372,"Sep 25 2008	Not so great service/ rooms or stay all around	6 of us booked our stay at Hooters for the weekend we saw Jimmy Buffet at the MGM across the street.Checking in was a breeze and the counter help was great. We booked King size beds however all 3 couples got 2 singles? The were out of rooms with Kings................The rooms were not clean, hair clogged the sink, the hair dryer was broken and there was junk all over the floor behind or under anything the vacuum could not get to. Two of the four light bulbs over the sink were out. I called and got a replacement hair dryer right away. The Dan Marino Restaurant when we arrived off the plane was empty, the bar was closed at 11:00pm and our server let us know it was his last night because he was going to a better place as the restaurant was no longer highly rated. The pool side service was the worst, the waitress took my drink and food order at the same time. I waited 20 minutes then chased her down to see if I could at least get the drink. She said &quot;OH I thought you wanted the drink when your food came out&quot;??The last night of our stay was the concert night. We ate at the Hooters Restarant and had a fabulous server named Stephanie. She made the best of a bad situation. We all ordered and began getting our food except my meal which they forgot because it was seafood. Stephanie removed the charge for my meal. The gift shop had really fun items and the staff was very kind. All said our next stay will be at the Stratosphere in November."
152,372,"Sep 23 2008 	Bad Promotion	Some positive and some negative-- We arrived early and were able to check in and the process was very quick with no one else in line. Booked directly with hotel because they were having a 200 dollar free casino credit...dont be lured in by this promotion....only certain slot machines included and I dont think anyone has ever won.... cant cash out when you do win. BAD promo. , and should not be deciding factor in booking this hotel. Hotel is very close to airport, so cab fare was only about 13 dollars. However, far away from Old Downtown Vegas..cab fare 30 dollars with tip. BED is awesome..shower had NO NO NO pressure at all...took 20 minutes just to take quick shower. We were on the 19th floor though. Not a huge pool area, about 50-100 guests max or there would be to many people... Only had one bartender on a Saturday and with the huge group there had a hard time getting drinks. perfect just to lay out and jump in to cool off. Water had a dirty film on top..could have been from the huge group of people there . Loved the hooters wings!! Always good... Breakfast buffet 9.95, kind of expensive, but convenient. not sure if they have a dinner buffet. ALWAYS a cocktail waitress to get drinks in casino area and at inside bar. that was nice, the bigger hotels you could hardly find one on your own. C lose to MGM, Tropicana, Excalibur and New York New York. Other hotels a bit of a walk. Overall, I would say that if I had not been lured in by promo I would have stayed elsewhere. Would only stay there again if I get hotel FREE or around 30-40 a night total."
153,372,"Sep 13 2008 	Brilliant time at Hooters	We decided to stop at Hooters as last year some of the party that we went Vegas with stopped there and really enjoyed it.I can honestly say that i didn't have a problem with the hotel at all.The location was great,the room was large and spacious and had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!!The pool was also great.Its location at the southern end of the strip was really handy and considering the price of some of the hotels in the vicinity it was really good value for money.The main benefit though was the size of the hotel,it was not too big.I've been to other hotels in Vegas and it takes ages to get to the room.We had a brilliant time and would definately stop again next time we're in Sin City.The only compliants i can make are the dirty carpets in the corridors and Dan Marinos wasn't the best but who cares,Vegas is full of restaurants."
154,372,"Sep 12 2008 	You get what you pay for	We stayed at Hooters in September 2007. Had booked the bungalow category by the poolside which had some downsides but then, on the other hand, was really cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. The room was clean, however, the carpets in the bungalow part of Hooters were horrible - both on the corridors and in the room. Dirty and smelly. Another downside was that there was no fridge in our room. We did, however, really like the pool are. Had great fun at the casino, too and enjoyed the restaurant. Service was good. It is very close to the strip but a real budget alternative if you do not want to pay the prices for the big hotels on the strip. Overall, I can recommend this place. You might not want to chose the bungalow category though :-)"
155,372,"Aug 30 2008 	beds are comfy	We were in the 2nd floor bungalow facing the pool. Yes, we had a real balcony! The bed was comfy, the view was great, but we didn't spend too much time in there, it WAS Vegas after all! We had a great time gambling there at Hooters as well as other places but after a long day of fun in the sun our bed was soooo comfy, sleeping wasn't an issue. (The pool music does turn on at 10am or so though...)"
156,372,"Aug 30 2008 	Three Nights at Hooters Las Vegas	I arrived at Hooters at 9am, but was not allowed to check in until 4pm. This is a somewhat small hotel in Vegas standards, so do not plan for an early check-in!The casino is rather small, but the hotel is in a nice location being near to MGM Grand, New York New York, Tropicana and Excaliber.The hallways are dark with old stains on the carpeting. But the rooms are decent, clean and lively with the Hooter's orange decorated interior. Not too many outlets for portable radios and charging for cell phones. The bed was very very comfortable. The floor was very quiet. Housekeeping service efficient.Hooter's restaurant was great with the best chicken wings.Cocktail servers were great and Hooters has the best spicy Bloody Marys! The S.A.S.S. spa was great! I highly recommend either massese, Danielle or Lora. They both have different techniques but Lora was rather rough with the shoulder massage. I would recommend Danielle.There's no TV checkout, so plan on going to the front desk to handle that.Hooters is near McCarran, so I would suggest that visitors cab it instead of using an airport shuttle."
157,372,"Aug 28 2008 	Fun place to Play but not to Stay	I was comped 2 nights based on some play I had done earlier in the month. I played for 2.5 hours or so and only earned about 350 points yet they still sent an offer, which is nice.I was given room 427 in Bay View tower, which is the older tower. I was walking down the hallway realizing my room was at the very end. I thought &quot;hey, they must have given me a suite!!&quot;. No such luck. In fact, I'm sure I had one of the worst rooms in the hotel. I enjoyed a lovely view of a large AC unit, parking lot and the Motel 6 across the street, in that order...lol.It's true the bungalow rooms are run down, more like a basic motel but the beds are very comfy pillowtops and they do have 24 hour a day room service(B $10-$15, L $10-20, D $15-$30 per item). There is a small balconey too which is nice. I watched planes land at McCarran for awhile while enjoying a drink. Oh, the sheets and towels were stained with what looked like coffee. A nicer hotel wouldn't put out stained linens.To be fair, the hotel isn't part of Hooters. it is run by another company. I think it is the same one that runs Sam's Town as they use the same toiletries. They also run Saddle West in Pahrump, NV, which I have stayed at several times.Also, the walls are very thin. I was woken at 1am by the couple next door having an argument. I would usually enjoy hearing a couple fight but not at that time of day(night).Hooters restaurant serves good grub at OK prices. It's nothing fancy but the portions are large and tasty, and they bring you drink refills without you even having to ask.The casino was fun. I didn't make money but hit enough good bonus rounds to play for a few hours and drink the free Michelobs. Drink service is very good here.I got a comp ticket to see Gerry McCambridge: The Mentalist. What a joke. I left after 15 mins. Don't waste your money. Wait til 9pm and see Bobby Slayton instead. You know you're in trouble when the guy has to ask for applause. Funny, most of the audience was really into it. Maybe they've never seen a real Vegas show before. This wasn't it.Bottom Line: I've stayed at The Orleans, Bally's and Main Street Station in the past year. I would recommend any of them waaay before I would rec Hooters, even if it cost a little more. Hooters is fine if you're counting every dollar(my type room goes for as low as $35 sometimes)but for a little extra, you get a much nicer room at one of those properties. Stay in the Ocean View rooms, which is the new tower if you can. It costs more but I'm sure it's worth it."
158,372,"Aug 27 2008 	worst 24 hours	We always enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at San Remos. We have been going to and staying there for over 8 years. This year we planned early, payed for the room months in advance and was looking forward to another enjoyable trip to Las Vegas. WE HAD THE WORST 24 HRS. AT HOOTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We got in late Sunday night, only to find that because we would not allow the boy on the desk to charge $750.00 to a charge account. in case we trashed the room ,. He agreed to bring the figure down to $500.00 CASH. We were tired from our 5 hour flight and just paid it knowing full well that we would get it back at the end of our trip because we had no intention of damaging anything OR spending a dime more than absolutely necessary here. The hotel as well as the room is in poor shape.Our bathroom floor and caulking around the fixtures were dirty. The room was scary, from worn bedspreads and filth, too the poor workmanship of the wood that was added to the ceiling and every place else that it was put. We won't even talk about how bad the carpet needed cleaned and in someplaces needed replaced. It looked like they took the old San Remos nice clean rooms and tried to give them a cheap facelift. A GOOD CLEANING WOULD HAVE GONE A LOT FURTHER. The extremely loud music and extra gaming tables they squeezed in to the &quot;casino&quot; area made it hard to get around. There were a lot of &quot;seedy&quot; looking people lurking around, that made me feel uncomfortable. We thought we were stuck there for 8 Days. Thankfully, my husband, after discussing our misfortune, while setting up a players card at Sam's Town Hotel &amp; Casino, was offered the same price $40.00 per night. We jumped at the chance to put Hooters behind us and actually have a great vacation. Also, they did not require $750.00 or even $500.00 in case we damaged anything. They were more than happy to have us. We won't be patronizing Hooters again or suggesting them to anyone, Smarter PA couple"
159,372,"Aug 27 2008	We had a great time!	Read some of the reviews and I was frightened at first but after staying there, I would definitely stay there again. We stayed at the Ocean View, the room was clean and spacious. The beds were super comfy, had the best sleep after a long night. For the price I got it for, it was a great steal.Not on the strip, but close enough. Didn't mind the walk at all plus the monorail is just across the street which was very convenient. Sure, you can stay at a better hotel for a higher price like the MGM, but hooters is perfect for the laid back mid '20 to '40's who don't mind a fun crowd. Plus, when you are in Vegas, don't waste your time in your hotel, get up, use the pool, walk around the strip and have fun at the other casinos which are everywhere.Overall a two thumbs up!!!"
160,372,"Aug 23 2008 	Great for some but not everyone.	Overall my stay at hooters was what I expected.Don't think of this hotel and casino as part of the strip. Because its not. Don't think of this hotel and casino as luxury, or high end, because its not.However, its not all bad. The hotel has very friendly service. The casino games were easier to win at oppose to others on the strip, and the hotel rooms were spacious and clean. Not to mention, the beds were phenominal ! The location and price can't be beat either.The pool was great, the entertainment was good, and the hooter girls are dressed just as approriately as most of the other casinos. The hotel is showing its age, and is in need of another renovation. In summary, If you are the traveller who doesn't mind staying at a motel 6 or the type who won't be spending any time at the hotel....Hooters is perfect for you.If you are the traveller who has high expectations, wants to be impressed, and/or pampered, don't be fooled by Hooters marketing, its not for you. Stay at one of the major players across the street."
161,372,"Aug 19 2008 	Vegas baby!!	After reading a few of the reviews I decided to make my own mind up! was in vegas for memorial weekend in May to watch ufc and stag party most of whom stayed in the nearby MGM Grand.The Hooters rooms are huge and have all you need, true the corridors might need a lick of paint but who comes to vegas to sit in their room! staff where very friendly, even got a replacement room swipe card when one of my buddies was out with ours and i needed to get into the room,offered to bring it back but told to not worry about it! the casino staff were first class even giving a helping hand on the blackjack table sometimes!!...and the place overall had a less pretensious vibe than the larger casinos,all about having fun! food was ok,a bit greasy sometimes but just what the doctor ordered after a few nights on the sauce.Excellent location opposite MGM,5 mins from strip, Excalibur, Tropicana, New York New York, Luxor and Mandalay Bay all nearby,would choose Hooters again for the laid back party vibe and the lovely Hooters ladies! VEGAS BABY!!"
162,372,"Aug 19 2008 	Don't do it	Stayed in this hotel after a delayed flight. The staff are friendly &amp; helpful if you can ever find them. Restaurant dreadful, dirty &amp; nasty. Filthy plastic seats, appalling buffet. Bedrooms had revolting carpets, TV did not work, internet did not work. Graphic pornography on the TV when it did work. Horrible, horrible, horrible &amp; we weren't paying!"
163,372,"Aug 19 2008 	Fantasic	I was a little worried about staying due to the odd review and the price I payed to stay here (on the hooters website it averaged $50 for both of us a night !) , but from the moment i arrived it was just fantastic ! We stayed here and later on at the Luxor and ok the room wasn't as fancy (we had a suite at the luxor), but it was clean and right next to the pool. Only one bad point no fridge and ok there was a chipped tile in the bathroom and the hall carpet has seen its best - but who the hell cares about a chipped tile ( the luxor had them too !) and I wasn't sleeping in the hall ! The pool was great fun ( but not 18-30's !) and i liked the fact there wasnt 1000 kids annoying you all the time, to be honest i prefered the pool to the one at the Luxor ! The food was brilliant and a sensible price, as were the drinks.The hooters girls service was great and there are increadibly friendly. It just had a friendly, personal feel that the other casinos didnt have. Its right next to the strip and is 100% better value for money ! We stayed at both as we wanted to experience more than one hotel ( and it was broken up by a night at the canyon) but when we go back to vegas I'd pick Hooters over the Luxor every time ! the value was brilliant and I'd rather spend my money on other things than a room I spend no time in at all really !Overall Fab !!!"
164,372,"Aug 9 2008 	Hooters - give them a chance !	A quick review of our 3 nights at Hooters. We stayed 3 nights in late July in a total of 3 rooms / 6 people. Everyone had a great time. We were upgraded from the bungalo room we'd booked to a tower room at no charge , just for asking. The front desk folks were friendly and fast to check us in. The casino/hotel itself is a remodeled older place, but clean enough. To make a fair comparison to other places to stay, you must factor in price. We paid about $25 a night and expedia gave us a $50 gas card for staying 3 nights. The rooms were spacious and clean. Beds and restroom were perfectly acceptable. The pool was large and had a fun atmosphere going on. We did join the players club and 1 of the 4 of us actually won $50 for the free slot play. People complaining about some free gambling crack me up. Do you think everybody wins ? 2 of the 3 of us that used the 2nd offer of $25 in match play for table games won also. If you are a Bud Light drinker like me,they provide the tall aluminum bottles when you are gambling . And when I arrived home, there was an email offering a free 2 night stay to come back. I'd recommend avoiding the midnight 0.25 wings they were not good at all. You won't get the level of luxury at a lot of hotel / casinos in Vegas, but if you want to spend your money sightseeing and gambling instead of paying $100-250 a night for a hotel room , stay at Hooters"
165,372,"Aug 8 2008 	A good deal	A great hotel for the price. We paid just $33 per night and got a $50 gas card from Expedia.com making the total cost for 3 nights just $50. When we arrived we were given a room upgrade without asking - which I figure happens often because there are only about a dozen of these rooms and once they fill they start upgrading. My advice is to book the cheapest room and roll the dice and test your luck to see if you get the upgrade. The room is better than you would expect for the price, but not necessarily the best. Those that don't spend much time in their room or have relatively low expectations will LOVE this steal of a hotel. Hotel snobs should look elsewhere. Also, skip the breakfast buffet which was sub-par. You can get much better food elsewhere for the same cost. Play the 25 cent video poker/blackjack at the bar at the back of the casino. You'll get constant complementary drinks while you play and the beer there is kept at a chill 25 degrees. Delicious."
166,372,"Aug 5 2008 	Yikes!	I would probably have chosen the &quot;terrible&quot; category but the desk staff and restaurant staff were very nice. Upon check in, we were offered what's called a &quot;bungalow&quot; category room. After dragging our bags through the casino and pool area, we found our room to be poolside. I'm without words to describe how nasty it was! The carpeting was filthy, the vanity sagging and it was dark and dingy. The smell which was fresh paint, covering smoke stained walls and topped off with cheap air freshener was sickening - I literally became ill from the stench! From what I could tell, it's a very old motel which is now Hooters. The walls were concrete and brick which allowed no cell service or internet access. The music from the pool was very loud and permeated the walls. Upon checkin, we were directed to sign up for $100 of slot play which was the most ridiculous thing! We stood in line and a very cranky man signed us up. We then stood in another line where 12 or so machines are roped off and pre-set to pay out on what I'd venture to say is a specific schedule. Many of the casinos offer $10 of slot play in the machine of your choice. If this was designed to get us into the gambling mood, it did not - we didn't spend a dime in the casino after this annoying experience. I would say, if you're a young man about to celebrate your 21st Birthday, this is the place. The pool looked fun, the Hooter girls are cute and it's close to the strip for about $45 per night. We're not the boring or picky type - the smell was just too awful."
167,372,"Aug 3 2008 	Weekend in Vegas	I was heading to Vegas to meet up with friends and see a couple concerts over the weekend. I had been in this hotel previously when it was called the San Remo. The Hooters is located across the street from the MGM Grand where my concert was that weekend. The hotel is a typical one, has the pool scene, band playing and of course gambling. I was in a room poolside that from first guess you'd think would be too loud but there is a barrier between the rooms and pool so it wasn't that bad. The room was fine, nothing special and was clean enough. I chose it mainly for price as it was under a $100 a night and it wasn't a rundown out of the way location."
168,372,Aug 2 2008 	Great Time at Hooters	I was a little reluctant to stay at Hooters but we could not pass up the good rates. It is in a good location and is close to the strip. It takes less than five minutes to walk.The rooms are decent for the price and are clean. The hallways look like they could use some remodeling. We loved the casino and had a great time. The staff were friendly and service was great. There were only 1 or 2 that acted as though you were bothering them. The tables are cheap and during the day you will find $5.00 tables. We did not go swimming but we did walk out to the pool. It looks nice and has a tiki bar.Besides sight seeing we stayed mostly at this casino to gamble. And we are definitely going to stay here again. If this helps at all we are a married couple. I am 31 and my husband is 33. My husband loved Hooters as well. Especially the Hooters Girls! lol
169,372,"Aug 1 2008 	it was really ok - better than we thought	Booked this hotel thru airline so it included flight - $11 cab from airport - arrived early 2 pm fast checkin. room ok yes it was basic but beds really comfortable, plenty hot water. oh no &quot;where's the coffee maker&quot;I said -cannot live without that - asked a maid in the hallway -lucky she understood! and within 5 minutes coffee maker and good coffee packets were delivered. now every day we had to call housekeeping to ask for more coffee packets but that was no problem. also enjoyed swimming in the pools which were larger than the basic hotels offers. room was quiet (on 12th floor) taxi back to airport $8"
170,372,"Jul 25 2008 	Unimaginative Management	After travelling 16 hours from the Southern hemisphere we were looking forward to getting our heads down on a bed - but no - we had to wait 6 more hours! Why? My brother-in-law booked and paid for our rooms and I had an email printout of confirmation, but because it was his name on the reservation, and he hadn't mentioned our names when he booked (the form didn't ask for all names), and he wasn't arriving for a further six hours on a different flight, we were not allowed to have our room. The young duty manager seemed to take some pleasure in telling us he wouldn't let us in &quot;because Las Vegas is a bad place and there is a lot of fraud here&quot;. He offered for us to buy another room! or go somewhere else!!. In the end we were forced to store our bags there and go out on the town until my brother-in-law arrived. Surely there could have been some other compromise arrived at. Apart from that the rooms were fair for the price paid. After all, its the location (over the road from the MGM and monorail, and just a block to the Strip) that makes this hotel good value for the money.But would I go there again? NO.Moral of this story - make sure you put ALL names on any reservation you make."
171,372,"Jul 22 2008 	Best suite in Vegas Period!!!	We stayed at Hooters because they were only $50/night during the week. We were put in a standard room(overlooking the dumpster and the strip). All night the A/C was rattling and the people picking up trash were very disturbing. We complained in the morning and were upgraded for the rest of our stay to the most amazing suite I have ever seen!! It was two rooms, two full massive bathrooms, a fridge, kitchen couch in the living room, two seperate balconies, excessively clean and massive flat screen tv. I can not say enough about how impressive the suite was, I have seen lots of suites in vegas and this is by FAR the nicest. The comedian Bobby Slayton is absolutely hilarious(and a great deal since we got free tickets thrown in with our room rate) although if you are sensitive about race, sex, creed, etc. you will hate him. The pool area is very nice and comfortable. Although they charge for the weight room, it was very nice and after asking nicely we got them to let us use it without charge, it is amazing what these people will do for you if you just say please and smile. All people who worked here were very friendly and accomodating. I highly recomend this resort for anyone who is willing to walk/take cab for food and entertainment."
172,372,"Jul 16 2008	A Horrible Scam - Stay Far Away!	The Hooters casino advertises $100.00 in free slot play when you join their slot club. We called to ask, &quot;What's the catch?&quot; and were told there was no catch. When we got there, the free slot play was only for a small, roped-off section of machines. We also got some useless coupons, including one for a free drink at a hotel bar that did not open for several hours. We were so turned-off by Hooters' deceptive advertising practices that we left and did not go back."
173,372,"Jul 8 2008 	A Good Choice	Readers, the Hooters Hotel&amp;Casino is a good, inexpensive alternative to the overpriced Strip properties. My visit was the weekend of 19-20 June, 2008. I traveled alone, for a reunion and retirement ceremonies for my military unit.The price was $109 per night for the two weekend nights. For the location, this was a very good price. Hooters is about 200 yards from the busiest intersection in Las Vegas, where the Strip intersects Tropicana Blvd. Walking was easy from one property to another; there are pedestrian walkways above the street, for all four possible street crossings. I did not use the $20 bill trick, because the room did not matter. *Remember, when you do tip the desk clerk at check-in, be ready to ask for what you want! &quot;Pool View&quot;, &quot;Quiet Room&quot;, &quot;Strip View&quot; or &quot;Upgrade&quot; are the common requests, here.My room was in the taller, Ocean Tower, 16th floor. The window faced the Strip-Tropicana intersection. This made for a fabulous view! I left the drapes open all night, so that I could see the Strip at any time. The view was clear enough to read the signs and watch the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York, New York Hotel.The room was fine. It was a major upgrade from similar rooms when the hotel was the San Remo. It had a tropical (Florida?) motif, and solid wood accents were throughout the room. The AC was fine, the bed was king-sized, and the bathroom was fine.The small casino was always active, and there were always plenty of orange shorts around. The table games are tighter than you can get elsewhere. WARNING: think twice before accepting the &quot;Free $100 in Slot Play&quot;. You may have to stand in a long line to play a specific machine. The people in line looked like they were suffering, and those at the machines seemed to be just &quot;getting it over with&quot;.There were constant elevator problems. Only one lift was available for the entire Ocean Tower. When this is the case, the hotel should open the stairs doors, so the more fit patrons can move quickly! Don't lose your precious Vegas time waiting for a lift!The parking garage is nice, and Valet was quick(only used once). I was confused about breakfast options; it wasn't until I got home that I found out that Marino's had a breakfast buffet. I'm sure I missed it somewhere in the Services booklet, but it needs to be posted prominently. Marino's is a steakhouse; a guest will not immediately assume that there is breakfast there. I always left in the mornings.There is a naughty-girl vibe about the Hooters. Surprisingly, a large percentage of the clientele is young females, who seem to enjoy the &quot;I am allowed to dress like this, here&quot; idea. This is not for me. To me, it is about table games.Personally, I prefer the downtown hotels. They are all adjacent, and the canopy protects walkers from the heat. The 4Q is larger and cleaner, at about 1/3 of the price. I invite readers to read my reviews of Golden Gate and ElCortez, which are two of my favorites. I wouldn't mind returning to the Hooters, but there are other choices.Contact me at [-], with &quot;Las Vegas&quot; in the subject line, if you want to ask questions about Hooters or Las Vegas.Gene Padgett!Starkville, MS"
174,372,"Jul 3 2008 	You get what you paty for	This is a great place to go...if its you and the boys... and you are happy with staying in a howard johnson/days inn type property. The hotel is NOTHING fancy and neither are the rooms. The place is not the cleanest...but it was disgusting either. If your the type of person who sees a drink stains on the carpet, in the corridors of the hotel and get grossed out...this isnt the place for you. Not the kind of place I would bring my girlfriend too...but for a guys bachelor party its was ok. The best thing about this property is the location. You cant beat it for the price. Theres a nice breakfest place next door thats good and cheap ( coco's) and the MgM grand is across the street. Vegas has a way of getting lots of money out of your pocket...whether it be gambling, partying, or just doing the different tours and shows...So If i was going back with a few guys...I would come back here...with my girl...the Mgm grand is nice and I hear the price is reasonable.As most people in vegas...we spent very little time in the room sleeping. So for the 4-5 hours a night your gonna spend in the room its fine. If you want something really nice....try the Ceasars palace...but dont complain about paying $450 + per night.Remember....you get what you pay for."
175,372,"Jun 28 2008 	Tattoo City!!	My husband and I were the only ones in the property without tattoos for sure. The clients were a little low rent but there were plenty of great things about the place.  Quick walk to MGM, Excalibur etc. Great rate, we paid around $40 a night and I have paid more, a lot more for less value.The room was spacious and the bed VERY comfortable and the pillows soft and not the usual hotel rock hard. Our floor was very quiet, maybe because we were in the non smoking section.The air conditioner was a little noisy but actually helped put me to sleep as it runs 24/7. The casino was small enough that I could find me husband without too much trouble, and I liked that . The cocktail waitresses were very pretty and came around all of the time-not like a lot of places. Overall a great deal and a nice room."
176,372,"Jun 28 2008 	I was a bit disappointed	I stayed here with my brother for two nights in June 08. I was kind of surpised to find the property a bit shabby. My first impression was in the parking garage and elevator. Both were filthy. The elevator drops guest out... somewhere .... and it took some suitcase dragging through the casino to find the check-in desk. The check in clerk was friendly and make check-in easy and painless.We went up to our room on the 14th floor and found a pair of full size beds (I thought those disappeared with I Love Lucy). The elevator was slow and reminded me of an old elevator I rode in a Hungarian hotel a few years ago. More importantly, no coffee pot in the room. A full pot of coffee delivered to the room by room service was about $21.00. That was really lame. Getting coffee in the morning was a hassle and expensive ( I think about $3.00 a cup downstairs in the crowded gift shop.The bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably clean, albeit small, poorly lit and drab. The windows were filthy and hard to look out of. The air conditioner worked OK. I found this room to have less than average storage (drawers or places for my stuff). A TV armoire with a broken shelf was about it, with the exception of a standard motel closet with about 8 hangers. The room did have an electronic safe that worked.. I did not have any encounters with hotel staff. All in all, it was not a bad value, but nothing to write home about. I expected a cleaner, more well maintained property. It was no so bad that I would never stay there again, the rate would just have to be very low (like $35 - $40.00 a night) to match up with the Fremont Street like grunge feel."
177,372,"Jun 23 2008 	More positive than negative	We went to Vegas on our first trip and didn't know where to stay...I did alot of research and needed specific times to fly out so we booked seperately... I came upon Hooters while searching for a good bargain. The prices seem great for our budget and at first I was not happy that it was not on the strip. But come to find out it was right across from MGM so it didn't seem to be too far...and it was not at all. We reserved a while in advanced and it was the bungalow...there were alot of reviews that were bad but we took our chances. Upon arrival, checkin was not long and we were given another room. The Room was great!!! I don't know why people complained soooo much about this place...it was nice. We are not cheapos but this our first trip so we wanted to be conservative...we knew we would not be there long. The room was clean, cold and of ample size...we were above the pool and could not really hear anything...the a/c was not overbearing...and the beds were to die for!!!! I have paid more in the past for other places and they were horrible. We were so glad with our choice and plan to go back there again... the only downslide is that some of the Hooters girls were kinda rude and had attitude like their you-know what-didn't stink...and they were not even that cute...food at Hooters restaurant was great and Dan Marinos Breakfast was good tooo especially the fruit. It was nice there too because all the other Hotels were sooooooo freakin huge and the walk to our room was nothing and convenient. the slots were okay but not great but who cares there hundreds more to enjoy on the strip... Also the free slot pay is a joke!!!!! Yet the coupons we got made up for it...The cleaning staff were nice ande didnt enter when we asked them not to and offered fresh towels everytime we saw them...great hard workers!!!! FYI take a cab to and from the airport it is about nine bucks the shuttles are more just mention to not take the highway!!! They will try to scam you. Anywhoo, we enjoyed our stay there and hope you will too and fancy amenities are for those who like to blow money...I had more money to shop eat and gamble!!!! Have fun"
178,372,"Jun 22 2008 	10 Days stay at HOOTERS	This hotel was exellent value for money. The staff on reception were very helpful, HAPPY, and even upgraded us to kingsize rooms which were very roomy in the Tower Block. We viewed the bungalow rooms in the old part of the building but they left alot to be desired. The staff in the shop were not so happy and not so helpful. Pool area was very clean, (waterfall out of use). Food was ok, didnt go a bundle on the chicken wings tho tasted disgusing, but other people seemed to like them. Coffee was exellent value, if you bought a Hooters mug, your coffee was free for the whole of your vacation. A little disappointed that there was no chill out area ie lounge with comfy seats to sit and relax and drink your coffee. The choice was either drink it at the machines, or take it to your room, there are tables and chairs outside but the temperature being 112degrees wasnt an option for us.Overall this hotel is exellent value for money right next to MGM and other major hotels on the strip, and only $10 taxi ride to the airport."
179,372,"Jun 20 2008 	Enjoyed staying at Hooters	This was my third trip to Las Vegas and my first time staying a bit off the strip (previous stays were at Flamingo and Ballys). We booked a Sat-Mon stay on Memorial Day weekend for around $250. For this price, we found Hooters was a very good value for the money. If you are looking for a 4 star hotel with fancy rooms, this is not your place. However, if you are looking a no frills hotel with a laid back, casual atmosphere, then this is your place."

The Hooters Las vegas is great- I saw some of the reviews, &amp; I don't know what people are looking for in a vegas hotel for this price, the venetian?????.The front desk crew was professional, checked me early, gave me a free upgread without even asking.the room was big, clean, very comfortable, everything worked, when I needed helf with my internet connction, the man showed up after few minutes and did a great job.the atmosphere in the hotel is young, relexed, even cozy comparing to the big hotels in vegas-no miles to walk, and 5 different towers-loved it.I was planing to stay 1 night-I stayed 3."
181,372,"Jun 17 2008 	Couldn't ask for anything more!	Finally arrived at Hooter's after an horrendous 27 hour journey from the UK with Delta (will not use them again!) totally exhausted! I was travelling with my cousin for a friends wedding the following day. Before arriving I was slightly concerned reading some of the previous reviews but there was no need to be worried. We checked in about 3am with no problems whatsoever. The elevator/hall ways were clean and had a very clean smell about them, I was dreading getting a terrible room as this would have just put the icing on the cake for us after an horrific journey but the room was way above our expectations. A huge room with 2 queen beds two tables separate dressing table with well lit mirror. very large closet and tv. The bathroom was a very good size too. Everywhere appeared spotlessly clean. The best part was actually getting into the most comfiest bed I have slept in! We were on the second floor of the Ocean Tower which had a pool view, this was blocked partially as we were on a low floor but that didn't matter one bit as we were hardly in the room during the day anyway. We had no problems with hearing noise from adjoining rooms.Once we had caught up on a couple of hours sleep we ventured downstairs for a look around, there was a small but cozy pool area with a pool bar, A 'Bait' shop selling souvenirs, drinks and snacks etc, there was two bars in the casino and three restaurants (obviously one was a Hooters!), we tried out the Dan Marino's Restaurant for breakfast which was delicious, good selection for a good price, especially the buffet for just under $10, unfortunately I never got to go to Hooters as the queue was always so long!All of the staff were EXTREMELY helpful and friendly, we wanted to spend a day shopping and enquired about buses and taxis to various places, after chatting with two of the bell hops (I didn't get there names unfortunately) we ended up hiring a car for the day which prob saved us a fortune in fares and a lot of time so meant we could do more shopping!! We were picked up right outside the front entrance by the car hire company and taken to their depot where our 'economy car' was waiting for us. I was expecting a very small car but it was a huge Chrysler Sebring so I guess we were upgraded. We also booked tickets to see 'an evening at Le Cage' a show at the riviera, we were able to do this throught the hotel and again the guy (an oldish gentleman) was very helpful and advised us of timings and stuff to make sure we got the best seats.The location of hooters is perfect, it's literally a 5 min walk from the strip, it's right opposite the MGM which also has a monorail stop so handy for that as well.The only fault I could find was that the ice machine wasn't working on our floor so we had to use the one upstairs but I would hardly say that's a problem or inconvenience. People have complained on here about not getting towels or bedding changed, there are little cards in the room explaining about helping save the environment and only having the bed changed if you really needed it, if you did all you had to do was place the card on the bed and they would do this, as quite a 'green' person myself I was quite happy with this. The pool area got very very busy with the younger crowd on a weekend with a live DJ playing very live music so not ideal if you are wanting a relaxing sunbathe.This was my fifth visit to vegas and i've stayed in different places each time, this is definitely one of the best values for money. Some friends were staying at the bellagio and we went to see there room and to be honest it wasn't all that it's cracked up to be (for what they paid I would have expected a lot more) and there was a really bad smell in the corridors! I would definitely stay at Hooters again, it's not a huge hotel and only has a small casino, but this makes it a lot more enjoyable and friendly."
182,372,Jun 16 2008 	Awesome Price for such a Good Location.	I believe this is one of the best properties for the price and location in las vegas it is directly accross from The MGM Grand...Although it is not directly on the strip it might as well be you can be at the MGM grand in less than a 7 minute walk. From there you can catch the monorail all the way up and down the strip. Pete's Poker is also not a bad little place to play some cards there is usually only about 2 or 3 tables running but the dealers are great and the company is better.
183,372,"Jun 12 2008	no-frills hotel great value very close to Strip	Stayed at this hotel at the start of June. Weather was very hot, the airconditioning (if a little loud) kept the room cool. Hooters is within 2mins walk of the Strip, just past Tropicana.Swift taxi ride from airport, about $10. Checkin efficent. No problems. Stayed in one of the rooms in the 'Bungelow' section. Arrived Saturday afternoon, and the pool party was in full swing. Plenty of 20-somethings around the pool with the music at full volume. that was the only day, to be fair, it was like that. the rest of the week was ok. the room was large and comfortable. sure, it wasn't the 'wynn', but i wasn't paying top dollar. the only major problem -- not the hotel's fault -- was a very loud 'cricket' that seem to share my room at night. i eventually found it on the final night and dealt with it. room was cleaned daily, with fresh towels etc. good range of tv channels, but you won't need them while in vegas. i would suggest using hotel as base, and spend time elsewhere. i would recommend this hotel, and may stay there again. enjoy."
184,372,"Jun 12 2008 	Excellent Hotel cool casino - recommended!	We booked a boys' trip to Vegas in April 2008 and on a friend's recommendation, we chose Hooters Hotel Casino for our accommodation.ArrivalWe flew to LA from London and drove straight to Vegas that night, meaning that by the time we reached the City, we were shattered - so hoped for no issues at check in. We weren't disappointed. The guy on the desk called up our details straight away and directed us to our to twin rooms in the 'Tower'. You enter the hotel through the casino, so are immediately greeted with the sights and sounds of Vegas - and of course, the site of the Hooters girls.The RoomThe rooms were clean, tidy and well decorated. There is an overall 'beach' style to the place which is no bad thing. The room had two queen sized beds, a decent sized TV, a desk and (crucially) good air conditioning. The bathroom was a touch dated, but clean and had no issues. We were on a lower floor, so our outlook was a flat roof with air con ducts, but also the MGM Grand opposite. Our friends' room was poolside - but again, too low to see the pool over the flat roof! Still, if you are coming to Vegas to sit looking out your hotel room window, you might want to rethink your destination!FacilitiesWe didn't use the restaurants in the hotel, but they were always busy which is usually a good sign. The bar by the pool was nice, and a good place to stand around sipping cool beer. We used the casino a few times and liked it a lot. Far less pretentious than the big Strip casinos and good fun. LocationGreat location. Just off the strip, but literally across the road from the MGM Grand, so not far away. We did a couple of day trips - Lake Mead for example - and the hotel was the right end of town to drive there. Big car park so no problems there.Any problems?Vegas is a 24x7 city and as such, you have to accept that there will be times when there will be noise at times that anywhere else would be unacceptable. After our 23.00 arrival from LA, we checked in and then hit the strip, returning at 3am. At 5am, what sounded like 40 girls (but was probably only 8-10 of them) arrived back to the room next door and made a lot of noise for an hour or so. This was all the more of an intrusion due to there being a (locked!) adjoining door between our rooms. OverallAn excellent hotel, in an excellent location. To be honest, we weren't sure what to expect, but were very pleasantly surprised to find Hooters to be an excellent place to stay."
185,372,"Jun 11 2008 	Worst Hotel Room Ever!!!	The room and housekeeping was atrocious.Window was filthy,Sheets smelled mildewed. I called housekeeping twice to have them changed and they were never changed in the three nights we were there. Luckily the room had two beds and we slept in the other one. Sheets were not changed for that one either.Had to call housekeeping each day for hand towels. They supplied us with bath towels and washcloths, but for some reason they hoarded the hand towels.The floor was not vaccumed when we first arrived. Little specs of paper was on the floor.The ice bucket liner was not changed the entire time we were there.The sink stopper was broken. Sink wouldn't hold water.The shower curtain was tied in place with a towel.This had to be the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in. I told the manager and I was give a $40 food voucher for the restaurant. The staff was friendly.I would not recommend."
186,372,"Jun 10 2008 	Very good value-a great find for $35 a night!	We arrived at the hotel fairly late in the evening, at around 9.30pm. Luckily we had no trouble checking in-the staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was located in the bungalows by the pool, on the second floor. Going into the property I was slightly worried by the worn look of the corridors, the room was a pleasant suprise though, and brightly decorated. Our room contained a bed, two bedside tables, a bigger table, a TV, and bathroom with shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion. The bed wasn't too comfortable, but it was more than big enough! Since we were in Vegas we didn't spend too much time sleeping, so it wasn't a big deal. I was slightly worried about the hotel location, but I need not have worried: The hotel is so near the Strip it wasn't a big deal not to be staying there. It's actually nearer to the action than hotels at either end of the stip, such a Circus Circus. All in all this was great value and I would consider staying here again. However, due to the uncomfortable beds, I would probably check prices elsewhere before looking at Hooters again!"
187,372,"Jun 6 2008 	Worst Hotel In Las Vegas!	Unbelievably poor hotel stay folks. I am a long time Vegas resident and I have been staying in Las Vegas casinos since the mid-1980s. Since it was Memorial Day and the prices were high, my aunt had three free nights at Hooter's Saturday through Tuesday and I accepted. Oh my God! Stick to the food (and girls in orange shorts) business Hooters !!! You know nothing about casino and hotel management. This place is so poorly laid out it looks like slot machines were dropped from the sky into a barn. The main floor is small, crowded, unorganized, ugly, dirty and there is no place to walk. Hooters is a place for people who have lost the will to live or have NEVER EVER been to Las Vegas before and think it's the happening place.The hotel was crowded due to the holiday. Yes they have young girls in tight orange shorts selling chicken, but as we all know not every girl is a beauty queen! (OK, I am not Denzel Washington or Brad Pitt either). Anyway, my aunt checks me in Saturday night and we get into the rickety elevator defaced by graffiti. (HInt: If there is no security guard checking your room key card before you get on the elevator, you are in the wrong Vegas hotel). Once we got off the Bayview elevator (as distinguished from their Oceanview? section), we immediately noticed the filthy, horribly stained and frayed carpet as trays of food set out for the roaches to commit suicide on. Plus this hotel stinks too. I cannot understand how this hotel allows its carpet to stay so dirty on a daily basis. We walked into the room and it was barebones of course with more filthy carpet and yes there were cigarette burns on the carpet. I did not want to touch anything in this room and all I could think about was the room was FREE!? I told myself to just try to make it through one night and then I would find another room. The rest of my family was staying at the Palazzo/Venetian and I spent most of the first night with them. I stayed out drinking there until 6:30am and drove back to this dump of dumps. I slept til 3pm and got the ultimate wake up call: a guy from the room next door came through the connecting door. I jumped up and he ran out as he apologized. Had I been a woman instead of a 6 foot, 240 pound guy, who knows how crazy and dangerous this situation could have been. I got packed up immediately and got the heck out of there. Please read the negative reviews and believe them. This hotel is AWFUL. If you can help it, avoid this crap hotel. This is NOT Las Vegas!"
188,372,"Jun 5 2008 	Clean Room	I was a bit scared booking here after reading some of the reviews, our room was just fine, yes it's average, I guess if your used to staying at the Wynn or Bellagio it wouldn't meet your expectations. It was a clean, average room, the beds were clean and so were the bathrooms. Our room was not ready when we arrived because we were about 2 hours early so they upgraded us from standard to ocean view tower without a problem for free. They also have the 100.00 promotion going on which is sort of a joke, didn't win anything on the promotional machines, but hey, it was fun with their money anyway. The walk to the strip was not bad at all, maybe 6 or 7 minutes, and you don't have to hike through miles and miles of casinos to find your room. I think the only complaint I had were that working vending machines were hard to come by (there is a store right downstairs) and if you leave your window open it smelled like chicken wings. I think we would stay here again for our next trip if it's still around."
189,372,"Jun 3 2008 	not as bad as i thought it'd be	Found this place on hotels.com for $29.00 a night. For that price, I thought &quot;why not?&quot; first impression...very bad valet service. I had to wait about 15 minutes for them to come out and take my keys, and it wasnt like the valet was busy, I was the only one waiting to have my car parked. after checking in, we went up to the room which was on the 6th floor of the ocean view tower. The hallway smelled kinda bad, musty like. The room itself wasnt too bad at all. Beds very comfy, room pretty clean, and decorated in a tacky but cute hooters decor. (like a beach florida type theme)The only two coplaints with the room was the air conditioning was very noisy, and there was MOLD on the shower curtain liner. My other complaint was the pool area...nice pool area, and they had a really cool looking pool bar. When I was there (3 days at the end of may) the weather was hot (in the mid-90s) and the pool bar never opened.all in all, not bad if your just going to sleep in the room and be out in vegas all your waking hours."
190,372,"Jun 2 2008 	A dump	The room was an unmitigated dump. The carpet was polka dotted with cigarette burns and something that was white. I don't want to know what. The walls were paper thin. The folks next door were not loud, but I could hear every word. Noise from the hallway and garage came right through. The light coming through the connecting door was bright enough to require me to put a pillow over my head to get to sleep. At one point I thought, &quot;at least the bathroom is clean.&quot; A summary inspection proved that wrong. The floor was dirty. The faucet in the tub had been leaking so long, it had rusted out all metal parts below it.Service? What service? I am told the hotel has been sold and won't be around long. No loss."
191,372,"May 30 2008 	Pleasant surprise	&quot;Hooters has a hotel?&quot; was the usual comment to my response to, &quot;Where are you staying in Las Vegas?&quot; Yes, they do and it pleasantly fulfilled all my needs for my short stay in Vegas. I arrived late in the evening and was promptly checked in. I was told my non-smoking king wasn't available, but I could have a non-smoking dbl and change to a king the next night if I wished. It didn't really matter to me so I stayed in the dbl. The room was clean and nicely appointed in the knotty pine beach look. There were nice toiletries in the bathroom, not the generic hotel soap and shampoo, and two luggage racks. (How many times have you been in a hotel where one person gets the luggage rack and the other one ends up putting their stuff on the floor?) Pluses: *Concierge-type guy was helpful with info about transportation *On-site restaurant open 24 hrs*Players Club has all kinds of offers and promos (take advantage of it)*It's only a block off The Strip and has bloody reasonable rates!*Being at the end of The Strip, there weren't any construction noises as there are further up. Minuses: *No airport shuttle p/u stop. I walked next door to the Tropicana and picked it up there. *Room service didn't come through. I ordered a hamburger at 3 am and waited 40 minutes for the 20 minute delivery. It never showed. Bad customer service [OK for me in the long run. Reeaally needed to sleep off the tequila and beer I drank celebrating the concert I'd seen with my buds :-) ].Overall a nice stay. I'd recommend Hooters to anyone who's looking for a hotel with reasonable rates and doesn't need fountains and a light show out front. It was clean, quiet and had everything I needed."
192,372,"May 27 2008 	We had a Blast!	Went to Vegas in feb. while we were there on the strip we sighned up for the Hooters Rewards Program, When we came home we recieved mail from Hooters inviting us to stay 2 free nights, so I booked the the trip for May! The staff was super friendly, we arrived early and they had an available room ready for us! The room was very clean with a super cozy King sized bed! Hooters also gave my husband and I free tickets to Bobby Slayton (Not for the weak), We really enjoyed the show and would see him again! The BlackJack Tables were allot of fun and the Hooters girls were very friendly!The only down side to Hooters in Dan Marinos, Eat else whare!"
193,372,"May 26 2008 	Clean and Comfortable	We booked the Hooters Casino Hotel because of price and location (South strip, so no car needed), and because it had reasonable reviews in the Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas and on Tripadvisor. A no-frills establishment, but the room was clean, the bed comfortable. The only problem was that our room was not ready at 4PM as promised. The room was sufficient for our needs; we spent our days elsewhere and returned only to sleep. A good choice if you are just looking for basic and inexpensive accommodations."
194,372,"May 23 2008 	Ok for the Price	My boyfriend and I stayed at Hooters and we were basically willing to accept anything for the awesome price. The price was good and we figured it was just a room that we slept in while we aere there. The problems seem to outweight the good and I am a pretty easy going person. The AC in Hooters was sooo loud and clanky. It kept both of us up all night. Secondly, no one is ever winning at the slots. Thirdly, the carpet is absolutely horrible in the rooms and the hallways. At times there was even the smell of vomit. YuckService at Dan Marinos and Hooters sucks! The food was great, but, each time we waited at least 10 minutes at our table before we even got acknowledged. The Owl Card- Wow....what a joke! For some reason they are never really able to tell you what you can get for comps as far as points go. Their was an earn 20 points and get 10 in cash reward. We did this and they cashed us out without telling us that we loose all our accumulated points to get an owl and other perks. They even have a 100.00 slot play that they advertise all over the place. The problem is that they have an area roped off and you are restricted to playing there with the 100.00. Their are about 8 machines and not a one ever paid out while we were there. We did see comidian Bobby Slaton which was awesome and our Owl cards paid for the show. Watch out for the drink prices though! We ordered 1 captain and diet and a second one as a double. The price.......27.00! Needless to say, we spent a lot of time at the MGM which is right across the street and very fun! I would say this hotel really needs to work on customer satisfaction. I most likely will not be back."
195,372,"May 18 2008 	hooters is awesome!!	me and my husband stayed here and loved it! yes its an older property in need of a bit of TLC but for the price its awesome! the property was clean, and the staff friendly! we loved the hooters theme and the restaurant was great! shame its gonna go! loved it!!"
196,372,"May 12 2008 	Was OK will not stay again.	Arrived at the hotel at noon. The chick at the desk acted like it was a problem that I tried to check in that early and made it very clear to me that no rooms would be available until 4pm (which was fine). I gave her my card and she said the rate was $59. I booked for $49 but since I had no receipt showing that (I called the hotel and booked over the phone earlier that week) I was stuck paying the extra $10. No big deal.Came back about 3:30pm and our room was ready. Hotel room itself was big and the bed was comfy. There was dried paint split all over the floor of the bathroom under the sink and the carpet was dirty. Opened the window and had a great view of the south strip. Window was gross though. The worst part of the room was the A/C unit. It was as old as dirt and when we turned in on it made this horrible grinding noise. We laughed at everything wrong with the hotel though because we knew it was going to be tacky. The A/C was really a pain though trying to sleep. When we slept we just turned on the vent because it didn't make that noise until you hit the COOL button. Lo and behold in the middle of the night somehow the COOL came on (no one touched it) and the grinding noise wouldn't stop and we literally could not get the unit to go off. We pushed the OFF button several times and nothing. It just stayed on, even when we left for check out it was still on.The staff here acts like they go out of their way for you but they don't. None of them have nice Hooters either, believe me I looked. The $300 in slot play you get isn't worth it. You're only allowed to play on the designated machines they have. Also check out is at 10AM and housekeeping will come to let you know. They were knocking on our door at 8:45AM to ask if we needed help getting our things together to check out.This hotel is OK if you're on a REALLY tight budget (or just spend the extra $20 a night and get a cheap room at Excalibur). But I wouldn't stay here again and quite frankly, I'm glad this place is getting sold and closed."
197,372,"May 9 2008	The things to know	this place is cool and when you go there make sure you get a owl card (it's free) here is a list of free goodies i got from hooters1: six pack of beer2: two for one dinner coupon3: 300.00 in free slot play.4: 4 free show tickets5: free stay at the hotel. 4 nights dec. 2007free stay 3 nights memorial day weekend 2008not bad,don't you think."
198,372,"May 4 2008 	wow...WORST. FOOD. EVER.	I'm only writing this review to comment on Dan Marino's restaurant. We stopped by shortly after midnight for their 25 cent Hooter's wings special. Being a big fan of Hooter's wings, I ordered 20 and was expecting to have a great late-night meal. Wrong! When the wings arrived they had a pale, sickly look to them. They were drenched in grease and had minimal breading on them. On top of this, they were almost cold. As a guy who can devour almost anything no matter what it tastes like, I figured it didn't really matter what they would taste like as long as they filled me up. Well, after my first bite I almost vomited in my mouth. Keep in mind that I have NEVER turned down a meal before and I am NOT a picky eater. The taste of the wings was indescribable...something along the lines of 2 week old dead roadkill (perhaps a possum) drenched in greasy raw sewage. Disgusting. The crazy thing is that I was actually able to eat 3 of them in the half-hour we were there. We were placing bets on me eating all 20, but those would have to be the worst odds in Vegas. Everyone at my table had an identical experience. In total, we ordered 80 wings and only ate 6 of them. Not wanting to start anything, we just paid our bill and got the heck out of there. A short trip down the street to McDonalds and I was in heaven...it tasted like a 5 star restaurant in comparison. I have sworn off Hooter's completely at this point. I will never eat there again. Just thinking about it is causing me to get a lump in my throat. This was literally the worst food I have ever eaten in my 30 years on this planet."
199,372,"Apr 29 2008	LOVED Hooters!!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for the weekendand and we LOVED our room. I read some bad reviews so I was a little nervous going into the room, but it was nicer then the room I stayed in a few months ago at the Luxor. The bed was super comfy, and the room was very spacious. The only downfall was the maid service came around every morning and knocked to ask if you wanted our room cleaned, even if you had a Do not disturb sign. Everyone was super friendly and they had great deals on food. We even ended up staying an extra night!!"
200,372,"Apr 24 2008	Hooters was awesome	Myself and 5 mates have just got back from 6 nights in vegas staying at Hooters - it was awesome. I had read the reviews and was a bit worried but neednt of been. The pool, casino and food were all good. The girls were obviously lovely and everyone really polite. It was a great stay and will definatley be going back. If you going with friends its a definate, couples - it depends what you like. Families really a no no.There was a good mix of males and females which was surprising but good to see. Thoroughly enjoyed it all."
201,372,"Apr 20 2008 	Loved Hooters	We stayed at Hooters April 14-19, 2008. We really weren't sure what to expect of the rooms, but had been to the casino before and loved it. We checked in early and they found a room for us an hour before check-in. Second floor oceanview tower, king sized bed. As far as standard rooms, it was very spacious. The bed was super comfy, I felt like I was melting into it! The only downside to the room was that the bathroom, while big with a tub, was kind of dark.As far as gambling goes, the dealers were all very pleasant. There was always a cocktail waitress nearby. We ate at Hooters 3 times! Of course, we do love the wings.All in all, I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
202,372,Apr 19 2008 	Like a disgusting college dormatory	Being right accross from the MGM you'd expect at least average accomodations. When I checked in I was told I was in a &quot;bungalow&quot; room. This actually meant that I was stuck in the run down seperate wing along side the pool area. The first thing I noticed was security guards everywhere. Then when I entered the building I noticed the disgusting stained carpet all throughout the hallways. The walls are dingy and dirty. I got into my room and saw that my door didn't really fit the doorframe. The deadbolt had to be strenuously manipulated. I had a humble view of a loud parking lot and my 2nd floor patio door was bolted shut. Its obvious that Hooter's is not concerned about the appearance or condition of these accomodations. If you're looking for clean comfort and a feeling of security stay away!!
203,372,"Apr 7 2008 	Worst Stay in Las Vegas	I stayed at the Hooters Hotel and Casino in April 2008 and it was the worst hotel that I visited in Las Vegas. The hotel room had bed mattress with bed bugs, the bathroom was dirty upon checking in, the sink in the bathroom was clogged up, and the Internet was not working. Upon complaining to the front desk it took over an hour for the maintenance staff to show up. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone else."
204,372,"Apr 6 2008 	Not impressed	This was a less than comfortable experience. The hotel is OK however is obviously a remodel of an older hotel, as can be seen from the old air condtioning units. The carpets in the rooms are dirty as are the hallways with cigarette burns and stains. This was the one thing that annnoyed me as the overalll experience would have beeen a 3 star otherwise. I would have expected a higher degree of cleanliness for what we paid.The restaurants are sub standard, with the breakfast at Dan Marinos's cheap and less than you would expect. Although if you go for the fruit option that is ok. Service is slow.Also the hooters restaurant is substandard with long delays and inaccurate orders being delivered.I would not recommed this hotel other than if you really want 2 star service for a 2 star price. Location is good just off the strip but that is about it. Be warned."
205,372,"Apr 2 2008 	Family Stay - nice heated pool and comfy beds	I was upset to have won this property thru my bid on Priceline ($52 + fees) for one night prior to our morning flight out of LAS, worrying that it would not be appropriate for our family. However, at least on the Monday night we stayed, the property was quiet. The downsides: 1) smoky registration area in the casino itself 2) have to walk through the casino with luggage to get to elevators3) could hear other guests opening and closing their doors, making my children awake and fear that someone was entering our room4) sinks in bathroom made getting ready a chore with four people, altho there is a vanity area with a light and wall mounted mirror that can be used for grooming.5) lumpy pillows6) stained carpets, a bit of mildew in showerThe plusses:1) nicely decorated pool area with waterfall and large hot tub 2) soft sheets and soft mattresses"
206,372,"Apr 2 2008 	So much fun - make a point to find Manny the Bartender!	To all fellow Vegas lovers: After reading some of the reviews we were somewhat skeptical, but found Hooters to be a knock down drag out BLAST. This was our 13th trip to LV and we'll definately stay here again. We both travel a ton, so if you're looking for THE Hotel or Bellagio Lite, this isn't for you. However, if you want a mix of the islands + LV - this is the place.Our first room was too near the dumpster which was emptied at about 5am - what a wake up call - haha - so we asked for a room change and received one without too much hassle, though it wasn't ready until later in the day, the desk staff when I did change rooms was fantastic and really funny. The entire staff was friendly, fun, and unlike other places actually seemed to be enjoying what they were doing and making a sincere effort to make the guests feel welcome -- Sorry, Harrah's - you're &quot;scripting&quot; of employees falls short, we'd rather get at &quot;HEY! You're Back!&quot; at the end of a fun day than some fake scripted &quot;Hello Mrs. Decker, how was your day, Mrs. Decker, can I assist you, Mrs. Decker&quot; any day. (We both have backgrounds in hospitality and I worked in Casino gaming for 9 years...)Two musts: One - find Manny -- he's one of the few male bartenders - and worth a visit in his own right. If you're tired of LV bartenders who don't know how to actually tend bar (i.e. scan their bar, remember your drink, and make you feel like you're a regular at some local watering hole) - he's your guy! While I'm sure he could do the dog and pony show of tossing bottles and flaming drinks, he's more interested in making sure you feel welcome and swapping a good story or two. So go say hey to Manny, leave him a nice tip, and chill out for a bit between gambling rounds.Second Must: Hang with the day time dice crew - some of these folks have been with the property for over a decade. They are real dealers who not only know the game, but have all the funny lingo down, and run a perfect pace at the table. You won't feel hurried or feel like a nap between rolls. Also unlike other houses that sweat the money - the crew and the box congratulated winners, with real enthusiasm and cheers and also gave newer players good betting information and were overly gracious when they were tipped or were put on the line with odds (don't cheap out folks, if you're going to put the crew on the line, play the odds for them) They regularly engaged players in fun conversation, talk of March Madness, and inquired whether people were having fun. Huh. They seem to &quot;get it&quot;, don't they??? We had a blackjack dealer that &quot;couldn't lose&quot; - but his personality and repeated yelling to the floor &quot;get me out of here&quot; was hilarious. You know the place is running well when the floor came over and started yelling &quot;Bust, come on dealer, bust&quot;. Too funny. Overall the service was fantastic, the beverage service is probably the best in Vegas - it was very personal, speedy, and tips were received with real gratitude. Note, too that each bartender we encountered made a great bloody mary - which is a big deal for us! If you're a rated player somewhere else and tired of feeling like a number or that your play isn't appreciated, call Faye, one of the hosts, and consider giving Hooters your business. As a woman, I can honestly attest to the fact that the &quot;Rack Pack&quot; is brilliant marketing - and funny - and while they ladies are, I'm sure, lovely to look at, they also have great attitudes and treat all players - regardless of gender or tipping level like kings and queens. And yes, they do have $5 tables and all the games. Their &quot;light up&quot; roulette tables are very cool, and all the dealers on that game we encoutered were teriffic. I think overall the best thing about Hooters was that people were having fun and there was great energy in the casino just about all the time. There were people in their 80's sitting next to college kids and everyone was having fun. Even though it was &quot;spring break&quot; season we didn't feel as though it was a &quot;frat&quot; atmosphere, and the extremely personable and interactive Security Staff - especially by the pool - made a huge effort to interact with everyone and develop a relationship so that if one of the guests did go a little &quot;over the line&quot; he or she was humored and teased back into good behavior. So, in summary, give it a try. If you're looking for a fun place that doesn't take itself too seriously and understands that it's the overall experience as much as the win/lose statement this may be what you've been looking for!"
207,372,"Mar 31 2008 	Great for ""Okies"" and most others	Just got back from Hooters yesterday and had a great time. As for the review a couple days ago, this Okie had the beautiful Kari (mentioned here often because she is great) compliment his smile right away (no need to stereotype people from Oklahoma :) If you see her, tell her hi from the Oklahoma guy with &quot;nice teeth&quot;.The Casino is small but BY FAR the most fun. I've been to Vegas 7 times and stayed up and down the strip and this place is alive most of the day. The Hooters dealers were awesome (David and Lito at the craps table) and the girls were great too. 80% of the ritzy casinos have dealers that seem to try to kill the mood and force you to unhappily lose your money. Not Hooters, we threw dice for 5 hours on Friday and Saturday, and it was a blast. Also nice is the fact that they will help you out if you aren't too experienced or get too drunk :)Sports Book - Really fun and really easy to get a drink for free.. just play some video poker here and there. It is small and closes early, so remember that if you have an early flight. You may not get to cash your ticket.The rooms are OK, compare them to a Hampton Inn type place. I was in my room for about 5 hours a night, so that isn't why I went. They smelled fine, had a good pool view (Bay Tower) and were kept clean.Pool area was alway happening and the bar (and scenery behind the bar) was great.I probably would've gone 5 Stars on this had the food been better and more available. Hooters restaurant is Always packed. I don't know if people don't eat at their local Hooters, but they all had to eat at this one. The only other choice was Dan Marino's and it was decent for breakfast, but for a $50 dinner you'll be disappointed (unless you love unlimited baby back ribs, then you're in luck for $16.95).Once again, if you need Bellagio or Venetian glitz, stay there. If you want to have a good time with down-to-earth people, Hooters is great. PLUS, they will still actually comp you a meal or something for playing 4-5 hours in their casinos. I hear it will be changing ownership and themes soon, so pay attention to that. Hope this helps... Book it and Have Fun!"
208,372,"Mar 30 2008 	It is what it is	Was in Las Vegas for March Madness so knew I would not be spending a lot of time at the Hotel. Hooter's met my needs perfectly and then some !! I was traveling alone with various friends coming in for the games. I had buddies staying at the Luxor, MGM, and NY NY so we were all close by. I have stayed at each of the other 3 plus the Rio and Bally's on past Vegas excursions.I can honestly say that the stay at Hooter's was probably my most pleasant stay in Las Vegas. Since I was by myself, my needs were minimal but they were surpassed. I probably wouldn't have stayed here if traveling with my wife, but after this experience I would. The location is great - 5 minute walk and you're at the Tropicana/Las Vegas BLVD intersection. You are 5 minutes from the MGM monorail station. The price I paid was insane to be so close to all of this action.As for the property itself, again I was presently surprised. The check in process was a snap and extremely friendly staff. I had a 5th floor room in the Bay View tower that had a good view of MGM/Monte Carlo - a little balcony that you could stand on and let in some fresh air - something that is rare in Vegas. Past complaints of old bathrooms are accurate - if you want a posh bathroom - look elsewhere and be willing to double your price. If you are using the bathroom to shower, dispose of waste and brush your teeth - this place will suffice. The room was comfortable and the bed was very nice. The place was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough.As for the rest of the place, I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino. I like craps and they had only one table going and makes it hard to get hot. I spent most of my time in the MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling but that is what my plan was coming in. I thought the dealers were friendly when I did gamble and it was pretty lively. The pool area was pleasant and there were quite a few spring breakers partying in that area, but everybody seemed to be getting along and having a good time. I ate lunch at Hooters twice and dinner at Marino's twice and had no issues at either place. The filet I had at Marino's rivaled those at Austin's, The Palm and other places that would cost twice as much.Bottom line - my experience was great. I'd definitely recommend it to those of you that know what you're getting in to. It is not Ceasar's, Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio. However, it is as nice and cheaper than plenty of the other older properties on the Strip. My only regret is that it looks like it might not be a Hooters come next March when we're back out for the basketball tournament."
209,372,"Mar 28 2008 	I loved it!	Hooters is a great place to stay while you're in Vegas. A buddy and I were there for spring break, and we saw fellow spring breakers staying there, but there we also met families, older couples, and business people who were staying there. We stayed in one of the tower rooms and it was very CLEAN and COMFORTABLE. The entire staff at Hooters, from the hosts at check-in, the dealers and wait staff, to the cleaning ladies, were all very friendly to us. The price is great, and unlike other Vegas hotels, Hooters does not charge resort fees on top of your regular room rate.The location is ideal, as its only one block off the strip and right across the street from MGM Grand, which also serves as a Monorail stop. We ate at Dan Marino's and also the Hooters restaurant and both had good food at a reasonable price. The pool area was nice, nothing like Mandalay Bay, but we also didn't have to pay Mandalay Bay prices for our stay at Hooters!I've been to Vegas a few times before and what I noticed the most about Hooters was the fun I had in their casinos. The dealers (some are Hooters girls!) are all friendly and talkative. They make your time at the table fun and entertaining, no matter whether you're winning or losing. I've played at other casinos and the dealers are very impersonal. Plus, Hooters is not as big as the other casino/hotels, so you don't need to walk a mile to your room, and while playing, cocktail servers make their way around much faster.This was a very positive stay for me. I will definitely go there again!"
210,372,Mar 23 2008 	Lots of fun at agreat price	I know it's not the first place you think of when you are going to Vegas. But you should give it a try. I really like the location. Your not on the strip but you are really close and you don't have to pay strip prices. Lots of fun . Clean room. Great Price Lots of freebies.
211,372,"Mar 14 2008 	Perfect for Okies!	If you have no teeth and are from the Ozarks this is your home away from home!This place reminded me of truck stops you drive by hoping you don't break down!At the very least, Hooters should have good hot chicken wings right? WRONG! They were cold and bad tasting.The girls were not friendly and seemed in a bad mood. Also, sorry to say, not very good looking for working at Hooters.The room was dirty and poorly decorated. There was mildew on the shower curtain.Thank goodness I only had to stay here one night!"
212,372,"Mar 10 2008 	Great for the price	The hotel is in very close walking distance to one of the popular strip intersections. The room was nicely laid out and a very nice size. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The decor was fun and beachy with lots of pine wood accents. The room was very clean. We were put in a smoking room because the non-smoking were full and we aren't smokers, but the room didn't smell like smoke at all. The bathroom could use a little updating but wasn't bad, just old. The casino was kind of small but a fun atmosphere. All in all I would stay there again for the price."
213,372,"Feb 28 2008 	It works	I stayed at Hooters for a bachelor party from Feb. 23-26th. We got a rate of $65/night average and booked knowing that we would be spending very little time in our room. With that in mind I'll try to include little tips and tricks we found while there.Our room was fantastically hideous with the orange and greens. The beds were advertised as queen (I was told this never confirmed it) and they were at best full size. We used the beds for probably 6 hours the entire trip so again not a big deal to us but if you enjoy soft, big, comfortable beds this place is not for you. We had a view of the pools which would have been great if they were in use. The hot tubs were going strong 24/7.The casino itself is small in comparison to those nearby. However during our stay we always found it easy to find a table to jump on, and the minimums varied from $5-10 for BJ, Roulette, and Craps. The dealers were very friendly and attractive. We all agreed that the casino topped all of the ones we went to in terms of attractive, nice, flirtatious dealers. They definitely made the experience more enjoyable. If you go make sure to sit down if Kari or Kellie are dealing, they are extremely fun to play the game with.We only ate at the hotel once, and we chose Dan Marino's for breakfast. The buffet was only $8.95, and did the trick of getting a decent meal in us. The buffet includes eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, fruits, and cereal. No biscuits and gravy which was disappointing. We did attempt an extremely late night/early morning visit back to DM but was told there was a wait (funny b/c there was noone in the place).Overall the hotel met our needs, and we did gamble quite a bit in the casino. Most of us found the slots to be pretty loose and more than half came out ahead while in the casino. One last note I had been to Vegas a couple years ago and used the &quot;Tickets 4 Tonite&quot; service. Basically it just offered show tickets for half price the day of showing. What I found this time was that dinner and golf greens fees are now also available. If you plan to play golf definitely check this place out! We didn't bring our clubs and we were sorely disappointed as we could've gotten a fantastic rate.Also note that we did a Treasures package that included dinner. What it entailed was for $3 each (yes $3) we got a complimentary limo, no cover charge, and half priced dinner. We were told there was no catch, and there wasn't. The dinner was below average, go somewhere else for a good steak dinner.Look for the Fat Tuesdays around the strip. There are 5 locations (one in Planet Hollywood, one in MGM) and they offer several different sizes and flavored frozen drinks (margaritas, etc) for reasonable prices. For example I chose the 46 oz. margarita and paid $11 for one, then refilled it for $8 the rest of the time. Compare that to one drink at $7-9 unless you're gambling of course, and that paid for itself easily.Slots - played quite a few and found the wheel of fortunes in the round with the gigantic wheel in the center to be by far the loosest. We played in NYNY, PH, Monte Carlo, Flamingo, and Palms and every time hit for at least $50. It is well worth it (note find the machines that have the max. bet set at 15 credits not 80). Played Wizard of Oz and Top Gun and was extremely disappointed in the pay out. Lasted 5 minutes max on each.Hooters Hotel/Casino is what we thought it would be, and if you book knowing what you're going to get how can you be disappointed. Close to the strip (5 min. walk through MGM or to the tram), good casino environment, and cheap prices. Can't beat it for a guys trip or budget stay. If you want more than 3 stars shell out the money and stay at one of the many different options..."
214,372,"Feb 26 2008 	Fun and affordable	Booked through their web site, and got a $50 per night rate. I thought it was too good to be true, but it wasn't. They even upgraded us to a tower room for free, and let us check in early. The dealers were personable, and the drink service is THE BEST IN VEGAS! I couldn't finish a drink before they brought me another. It can't compare to other casinos as far as decor and frills, but if you want to have a good time in a laid back atmosphere, Hooters is the place."
215,372,"Feb 25 2008 	Just what I wanted	This place was just what I wanted. I didnt want to spend the money that I would have to to stay on the strip itself (NY NY, Luxor, TI etc) and didnt need to have a room full or works of art (Wynn,Bellagio etc). The price was great, booked direct with the hotel and the location was excellent. The bathroom wasnt the best Ive had - they were old, but by no means small or unclean - the shower could have been better but so what?The two restaurants were good, just as expected, and the drinks prices were cheap as chips. Beds were very comfortable and the rooms were a good size - anyway, if your in Vegas, why you wanting to spend so much time in your room????The location was ideal - across the road from MGM grand, next to Tropicana - walk out the hotel door, walk two minutes and your on the strip - excellent.Would definatly use again - oh and the hooters girls were a bonus as well!!!"
216,372,"Feb 24 2008 	Not Impressed	Date: February 24, 2008Traveler from MinnesotaI just returned from a few day get away to Las Vegas. I chose Hooters Casino and Hotel for the price but also checked out the reviews and saw it was rated a 3 star Hotel. I was originally given a room on the 10th floor that I was so unimpressed with along with the drain in the bathroom sink hardly draining at all,that I thought it was a fluke and asked for a different room. The 2nd room was even worse. The first thing I wanted to do in the 2nd room I was given was turn the fan on. Not only was the lid that you flip up to adjusted the temp. cracked but it fell off in my hand. In the bathroom the sink drained a bit better, though it still backed up, but when I took my shower the next morning I ended up in standing water that came to within 2 - 3 inches from the top of the tub. I called the maintenance people and asked that they fix the drainage problem in the tub. The &quot;fix&quot; was done while I was out that day and when I took my next shower, the standing water was &quot;only&quot; up to my ankles not half way up my shin. There was also a lightbulb out in the bathroom the entire time and a plastic tag that was on the floor by the door that was never vacuumed up.I am not a picky person about my hotel rooms but with the water drainage problem and over-all ick feel from the room, I would never recommend this hotel. I would strongly suggest spending a bit more money for a better room at a better hotel."
217,372,"Feb 22 2008 	Perfect for the right traveler(s)	If you are trying to decide where to stay for your next visit to Las Vegas, consider Hooters for these reasons...1. We have stayed at Mirage/Treasure Island/Ceasars/Flamingo/Harrahs/Excalibur/Luxor/Hilton/Bally's. We have gambled in a lot more. Although none of our group did very well gambling this last trip, we all agreed on one thing, Hooters was the friendliest, most fun casino we have ever been in, hands down. This opinion was shared by my wife. This could be because Hooters does a good job hiring, or (more likely), because their dealers get to keep their own tips. Unlike most other casinos that &quot;pool&quot; their tips, each dealer gets to keep whatever tips he/she receives. In other casinos, one good dealer is typically followed up by 3 or 4 bad or very bad ones. Unfriendly or distant is how many dealers at other casinos always come across, but NOT at Hooters. The worst dealer at Hooters was more fun that 80% of the dealers at most other places. We have always liked Harrahs becuase they seemed to have a little higher number of happy, friendly dealers. Hooters even blew them away. I guess if your &quot;style&quot; of play is to treat the dealer as an &quot;adversary&quot;, and don't care about socializing with them, then you might not care for the casino. If however, you like to &quot;play&quot; when you play, Hooters casino is for you.2. Hooters is not right on the strip, but it shares a parking lot (basically) with Tropicana, and is directly across the street from MGM. It is very easy to get anywhere you want. The taxi line was never very long, and you were right across the street from the monorail. Hooters is a small casino, so if you like the huge casinos (we get lost!), then Hooters is not for you. If you like small and comfortable (and friendly, see #1), then you'll like Hooters. Plus you are right next to the largest casino in Vegas (MGM) if you want to change things up.3. Hooters is generally much less expensive than the bigger strip casinos. You will not get a $400 a night Venetian Suite at Hooters (for $79 or whatever), but you will get a nice, clean room with a comfortable bed. Hooters upgraded us when we checked in just because they had a nicer room available. Others in our group had standard (tower) rooms that were clean and comfortable, not terribly fancy. There is some signs of wear, some interior doors did not close properly, and there were some other signs of depreciation, but really, you had to be looking for problems. The room views are generally nice of the strip or the mountains, one of our rooms looked out over the pool, which isn't so nice in February but probably is pretty awesome when the pool is actually in use. Because it sits back from the strip, the views are generally not obstructed by the monsters on the strip (one of the worst views we EVER had was in an upgraded Ceasars suite). We would complain, however, about the manner in which Hooters placed the spotlights on the hotel facing toward the strip (our room), once the lights came on, it was a little like a police helicopter with a million watt spotlight was hovering outside the window. I think they could reposition the lights to be more indirectly shining into the guest rooms. However, this is not big enough of a problem to lessen our overall enthusiasm for the property.3. Service was generally friendly and prompt. We had a problem with our room safe on day one, and they were in the room in 15-20 minutes after our call. We have had problems at other Vegas properties that took days to take care of. Overall we were very satisfied with the service at Hooters.4. We ate at both main Restaurants, Hooters and Marinos. We had a good steak at Marinos, but felt that they may have lowered the quality (and prices?) to appeal to a broader array of customers. It was not quite the quality dining experience we hoped for. Hooters on the other hand was a Hooters. We are not &quot;Hooters regulars&quot;, I have probably been in a Hooters 4-5 times in my life, and my wife has been in one only one other time. It seemed pretty standard compared to the others I've been in. Decent food, decent price, decent service.5. Our group had people age from 23 - 48, including men and women. Everyone agreed that the hotel and casino met or exceeded all of our expectations, and offered outstanding value.If this casino existed when I was younger, I cannot imagine that I would have gone anywhere else. The dealers are not all &quot;Hooters Girls&quot;, and included men and women in button down shirts. HOWEVER, the Hooters Girls that were dealing were in many cases &quot;model beautiful&quot;. Top that off with their friendliness, and any heterosexual single man (and probably too many married ones), were really in seventh heaven. This is not a place to be a drunken slob and disrespect the employees (plenty of security ready to help you out to the street), but if you were there for fun, and can behave, you'll have a blast.All of the Hooters employees, including the &quot;hottest&quot; Hooters girls, seemed to go out of their way to make my wife feel comfortable. She really had a good time. However, she did feel uncomfortable getting in a cab by herself at Ceasars and telling the driver to take her to Hooters (I was working and she was shopping). That uncomfort was probably exascerbated by the jerk responding &quot;whoo-hoo!&quot;. Only you know what kind of couple you are, and if the &quot;Hooters&quot; name is too much for you or not!In conclusion, if you are looking for a fun, convenient, smaller, clean buy not necessarily luxurious place to stay in Vegas, I think you'd have a hard time finding a better choice and value. Being a Vegas &quot;veteran&quot;, half the battle is determining a good &quot;match&quot; for your groups &quot;personality&quot;. Hooters was a very pleasant surprise for us. Wherever you end up, remember, don't take more than you can afford to lose, and then have a great time!!"
218,372,Feb 21 2008 	Close to Mandalay Bay/Luxor end of strip	Got a great price on accommodation so for the budget this hotel has all you need. They overbook so could not get the non smoking bungalows (although booked on line for this). They moved me the next day. Internet access ended up costing about 30% of the room rate. The ribs at the restaurant are good. And the Mentalist show at Hooters will blow your mind away. Worth seeing.
219,372,Feb 19 2008	Dirty	It was very dirty and not organized there were nasty stains from the last people. They did not get cleaned up. I will never stay there again and customer service sucks I do not recommend staying there! The only thing that was half way decent is the ladies
220,372,"Feb 18 2008 	You Get What You Pay For	Buyer Beware- Hooters casino and Hotel isn't what it's cracked up to be. It's really nothing more than a glorified Motel 6!! The old San Remo got just a small make-over and now they call it Hooters. They really have a long way to go to match their competition. There was a real party atmosphere all day and all night here. If this is what you are looking for, then Hooters is the place. The carpeting in the hallways was patched in(repairs that didn't match), we also had problems with the bathroom drains. The restaurants here weren't that great and were expensive. All in all, spend a few more bucks and stay elsewhere if you are looking for the real vegas experience, I know we will the next time we visit vegas."
221,372,"Feb 15 2008 	Much better than expected	I stayed for a week just after the Superbowl so the place was quiet for the seven days I stayed. Compared to the other strip hotels the casino was brightly lit but a little small and cramped. When it was really quiet few tables were in operation so I had to go elsewhere for some action. I was in a non-smoking room with a King sized bed. It was clean, the bed wonderfully comfortable with a great view of the strip in the distance. There are only two restaurants, Hooters (yuck) and Dan Marino's 24 hour diner (ok). The service in both was pretty good. The Dam restaurant shut a while ago and Porch Dogs is part of Hooters in the winter.The strip itself was only 5 minutes walk, the MGM grand lobby directly across Tropicana Av. The hotel feels a little out of the way but the monorail and deuce bus allow for easy access to the whole strip.For $39 a day during weekdays and $79 a day at the weekend I have to say it was excellent value for money. For the south end of the strip I saved nearly 200 by staying there. Not the full LV strip experience but for the price I'm not complaining."
222,372,"Feb 12 2008 	$39.00 A Night Poolside 	We visited Las Vegas last week for my moms birthday. We stayed at HOOTERS because the casino is small, close to the strip, and was a heck of a deal. We found $39.00 a night for two doubles. We stayed in the BUNGALOWS. This used to be the SAN REMOS hotel, Built probably in the 70's or 80's. The room was clean, and the bedding was great! The bathroom was obviously older, but not a big deal. We were expecting the VENETIAN. The room we had was 164.We had to use a key to get into the building as well as back in from the parking lot.It was convenient to the car, and casino. No multiple elevators, or hiking for an hour if you left something in the car. We were poolside, and the fire pit was outside our window. The noise level was a little higher then other hotels, again with age...We signed up for the member card that took a while, slow moving line. But it was worth it. We received a coupon book, $100.00 worth of slot play and free tickets to see BOBBY SLAYTON &amp; ROBERT DUCHAINE. These tickets sell for almost $40.00 a person.The Hooters rest was good. I normally dont eat there so I cant compare. But Dan Marinos left a bit to be desired, slow service, considering that is was after midnight and the wing special was advertised allover the hotel.All in all....This was a great deal, and we had no complaints."
223,372,"Feb 11 2008 	Great Value	We had a great experience at the Hooters hotel. It's not luxurious, but the rooms are clean, nicely decorated, and a great value for the location. I thought the Hooters decor of light wood and orange was a refreshing change after staying in too many drab, dark casino hotels. The Hooters attitude comes across as fun, not sleazy. One tiny gripe though, the sheets seemed to be made of polyester or something and were not all that comfortable.Check-in was a breeze, the staff was friendly, the other guests were courteous, and I really liked staying in a smaller place where you don't have to walk a mile to get anywhere.location is its best feature, right next to the Tropicana and MGM Grand, and within walking distance of the middle of the strip. Being right on Tropicana also makes for a very quick trip to the airport and easy driving if you have a car. I also liked that we could park right near the casino in a lot instead of having to navigate a parking garage.The pool area is small but nicely done, definitely geared more toward sitting around than swimming.I will say though that I was not impressed with the Hooters casino. It's very small, and what few tables they have start at $10 and are mostly novelty poker games and the horrible 6:5 Blackjack. Cocktail service is almost nonexistant. But, it's not really an issue since the much better casinos of the Tropicana and MGM Grand are right next door.All in all a great place for the price, I'd definitely go back."
224,372,"Feb 9 2008 	pleasant surprise	Feb. 3 -Feb. 8 2008 - We travel on the cheapo and love walking, so taking a break from the cold and walking miles a day is a bonus not a hassle. I'm a middle aged woman and have never been to a Hooters restaurant. I imagined the hotel to be full of drunk guys roaming the hallways, in the elevators, and at the pool. I thought it would be very uncomfortable like staying at a big frat house. But I'm a gambler and decided to take a chance. We were there during super bowl and there was no need to worry, the other guests and staff were respectful and pleasant. I've had worse experiences at Imperial palace with college guys screaming and throwing objects off balconies. Front desk, coffee shop, promotions, everyone was helpful and friendly. We had a problem with a lamp in the room. Staff arrived and fixed within 10 minutes. We were on the 17th floor pool view. I'm very sensitive to noise at night. The pool sounds and airport were not bothersome from that floor. I travel for work, we have vacationed many places and yearly for 20 years to Vegas. Hooters has the best beds by far of anyplace I've stayed. If you are out of shape - this place is not for you - the beds are on a high platform and you have to hop in, there are bar stools rather than chairs. One thing I did hate was the large fake potted plants in every corner and in the room. It took up too much space it was in the way. Hooters is no frills, no waiting in line, great location, good nights sleep. We found our new place to stay on our yearly trip."
225,372,"Feb 7 2008 	Hotel Nightmare	It was the worse hotel I ever stayed. They sent staff 12:00A.M. in the morning using high pressure water jet to clean the vent on the roof top. My room just next to it. I tried to compliant to the manager on duty, have no response, and stay that was routine maintance. For me I have to suffer the unbearable noise until 3:45 a.m. And I have to work 7:30a.m. in the following morning. I will let everyone that I know about the terrible stay of the century."
226,372,"Feb 5 2008 	Not my favorite...	We stayed at Hooters for Superbowl weekend, Thursday through Monday.We had a Bungalow room, and the front desk wasn't especially helpful with directing us on how to get there. You actually have to go outside, around the pool, and through a side door to get to your room.What was bad: -Hallway and room carpet was disgusting and stained-Pool view bungalows are loud, as they blast music from 8am to midnight.-One day housekeeping forgot to give us towels. The next day the towels we recieved were dotted with brown streaks...yuck!-Tahiti Village timeshare desk within the casino means no shortage of people bothering you if you're a young couple.-Players club line was always a mile long.What was good:-$60/night for our first two nights-Fun casino-5 minute walk to the front of the MGM-Watching the Superbowl in Hooters with Sheila as our waitressI won't stay here again, but if you're looking for somewhere cheap to stay, and aren't looking for any frills, Hooters works."
227,372,Feb 1 2008 	The Good The Bad and The Ugly	First impression was great. Then....Heat / AC - worse than an old Motel 6. I had to get up all night to turn the heat on and off.Food - Dan Marino should be ashamed of putting his name on this dump. Service - What service?Price - GoodCasino - One of the best small casinos I've spent $$ on. I hope OSI wakes up. They need the training staff from Bonefish Grill to shape up this place. Call me when you get your sh.. together. Garry
228,372,"Jan 31 2008 	What a Surprise!!	We went to Las Vegas for a work-related convention and needed an affordable room near the host hotel ( Mandalay Bay) for the week. Hooters Hotel had rooms for $50/night which we reserved due to its proximity to the convention. I had reservations about the quality of our stay as we drove into town since this was a themed property and a re-furbished older hotel... What a surprise! The hotel staff that greeted us on arrival were friendly and courteous and promptly directed us to the elevators to our room, which were at the opposite end of the property through their small and tidy casino. The room itself was HUGE and well-appointed. The hotel was recently remodeled when acquired by Hooters and all the rooms have new furniture, including a large work desk that accommodated two of us using laptops, easy-to-use Internet access, a high bar table and stools for taking a snack break, easy chair for lounging and a large, comfortable bed. We were on the Ocean View side of the hotel and had a nice view of the Strip from our 9th floor room. The bathroom was large and clean and had the usual features (toiletries, hair dryer) The room was well ventilated, quiet and was well cleaned our entire stay. The property also feature a 'beach' area with pools and 3 restaurants, including a 'Hooters'What I expected to be a no-frills budget stay turned out to be relaxing, comfortable AND budget-friendly. I will stay here again and again while traveling for work to Las Vegas."
229,372,"Jan 19 2008 	Great Atomsphere	I've been to Las Vegas dozens of times, including about 20 trips in the past year. I'm a Diamond Total Rewards member and usually stay at Caesars, Paris or one of the other Harrahs establishments, but I've also stayed at Circus, Circus (one night . . . NEVER again), Stratosphere, Sahara, Venetian, Monte Carlo, Golden Nugget, and a few of the non-casino hotels.A year or so ago I went to Hooters to play blackjack. Although I left with a lot more money than I brought, I left with a bad impression. The parking lot was old and creepy, the casino seemed to be dark and smokey, the tables were packed too close together, and with a couple of exceptions, the dealers seemed unfriendly.I recently received an offer that I decided to use to add onto a trip I had planned at Paris for last week. I'm glad that I did. I had a great experience.First, the room was exceptional for a budget casino. My room was a suite, and althought it obviously wasn't as big or as nice as a suite at Caesars or Paris, it was nicely decorated, exceptionally clean, and the quality was much better than I expected. I wouldn't decorate my house the same way, but it had a casual and comforable warmth that was a uniqe change. I would easily choose that room over many of the rooms I've gotten at other hotels. I also had a strip view from the 19th floor, which was nicer than the view I've had at most Las Vegas hotels.But the most pleasant surprise was that the casino seemed to be warmer and friendlier than I experienced on my first trip. Either my first experience was exaggerated negatively, or they've made improvements that result in less crowded space, brighter lights, and less stuffiness. Most importantly, the dealers were a lot of fun. After playing blackjack at the stuffy Bally's and Paris casinos, the Hooters atmosphere was a refreshing change.The hotel check in was a breeze. The staff was efficient and there were no lines. I also never had a wait at the cashier's window.Although Hooters is at the end of the strip, it's an easy walk to the monorail and a reasonable walk to the middle of the strip.One of the nicest features is the proximity to the airport. I've had cab rides from Ceasar's and Paris that run as high as $25 and take a half hour due to long waits in traffic. From Hooters the fare was $7.10, or $10 with a tip, and took aboaut 5 minutes.We ate hamburgers at the Hooters restaurant and had ribs at Dan Marinos. Both experiences were great, both in terms of the quality of the food and the service.There were a couple of negatives. As pointed out in other reviews, the hallways need to be upgraded. The carpet is dull and worn, and the walls need help. They caused me to worry as I walked to my room.I also had to wait too long in the player's club line. The first wait was between 45 minutes and an hour, and the second was about a half hour.Overall, my stay at Hooters was one of the best experiences that I've had in Las Vegas, or in any other casino, for that matter. If you factor in the reasonable rates and the more casual, relaxed, fun atmosphere, you can't beat it."
230,372,"Jan 9 2008	Thanksgiving at Hooters	For the 9th year in a row, we headed to Vegas for Thanksgiving. We were a group of 10 - 12, depending what day it was. Most stayed at the Flamingo on the strip, however, my husband &amp; I decided to try Hooter's Hotel &amp; Casino. It's convenient location to the monorail and the great rates we received, Why Not?Check in was a breeze. We reserved a downstairs bungalow. The room was small, but cute &amp; had a slider door to a patio. We were there 5 days/4 nights &amp; everything was great. Good service on the casino floor &amp; we even won a little bit of moolah.We are planning a return trip in August for our nephews 21st birthday - Can't think of a better place to celebrate a 21st bday!"
231,372,"Jan 8 2008	Decent for the price!	Stayed at Hooters for 5 nights in December. This review is based on the fact that I paid 39/39/59/59/39 for each night. If I had paid a little bit more per night I would probably have an awful review to write, as it isn't worth much more than what we paid.The rooms were clean. You could tell that they did MINIMAL investing in the renovation. Covered things up rather than fixing them up. The HVAC was loud and rattling but it didn't bother us as we like a little white noise as we slept. The beds were definitely very comfortable and clean which was nice. We were given double beds instead of a king, but we didn't mind much. The hallways were definitely gross, the carpets were stained and they were dim and dank. The elevators were fine. We didn't eat at the hotel, but found the little gift shops to be ridiculously overpriced, go up the block to stock up on bottled water, gatorade, etc.The location is GREAT. Whoever is saying its a 10-15 minute walk to the strip is ridiculously slow. We clocked it at 4 minutes.The casino is fun. A completely different atmosphere than other Vegas casinos but we enjoyed it. I love that everything smells like sunscreen/the beach and that they play fun music.Again, if you can get a ridiculously cheap deal on this hotel, go for it. If you are looking at paying anything more than $70 a night, definitely not worth it in my opinion."
232,372,"Jan 7 2008 	I am always happy with Hooter's	This was the second time I have stayed at Hooter's since the remodel. The first time was literally the weekend after it opened, the rooms weren't finished but hey, it was a place to sleep. Our most recent visit we were originally put into a room with two full size beds.....so not comfortable. My husband asked if we could be relocated to a room with a king size bed.....the room was so much better! The bed was comfy....all in all I was very pleased. I love this casino because if you go with a group people are easy to find because the casino is so small. We never had a hard time getting drinks and the casino seemed to pay out for everyone in our party! The food on the other hand, not so good, same with the service. My husband loved the bacon at the Dam restaurant but they have closed this so now all the casino offers is Dan Marinos and Hooters. Dan Marinos is terrible, terribly slow service and rude employee's. The Hooter's, lets just say you pay for what you get! The girls are hot but lacking customer service...But I have to say I love this Hotel....I just don't eat here!"
233,372,"Jan 7 2008 	Not worth the money!	We decided to stay somewhere new in Las Vegas and did we make a mistake! We thought Hooters would be fun, but were we wrong! Besides the fact it was New Years and we paid $250.00 per night (In some cases more than MGM and New York New York) thinking it would be different. We were not greeted with cute little Hooters girls but quite the opposite. The only place you see the cute Hooters girls are in the restuarant in the back, the problem here is that the line is always long to get it. Then when you get in the service is not good.The casino is very smoky, and has people in it from somewhere else!Then our room was so plain, the air conditioner was broke and we were told the night we arrived (after the engineer had been up 4 times to check it) that it was not to be fixed until the next week. They did offer to move us the next day but fortunately it got colder outside plus I did not want to pack everything up again.We will never stay here again!!"
234,372,"Jan 3 2008 	Nice for the price	I booked Hooters Casino Hotel as a birthday present for my husband. It was a great deal - $25/night. The location is fine.. just slightly off the strip. The beds were very comfortable, but we booked a king and didn't get it until the last of our three nights. The hotel is still undergoing renovation. The rooms at this old San Remo Hotel look pretty good, but don't always have the right furniture. The first room we had didn't have any chairs, just the three barstools. The second room was better wth a desk chair and a nice bedside chair. There's also no coffeemaker meaning you have to go downstairs to the little bait shop to get a cup. That shop also has Krispy Kremes. The carpet needs replacing badly in the hallway. We got an odd set of towels - 3 large, 1 hand, and 2 wash clothes. There are few plugs. There is Internet, but we didn't try the connection because we didn't bring a laptop on vacation.Food: Donuts and coffee/juice are available at the bait shop at a reasonable price. We had breakfast at Dan Marino's restaurant because the hotel gave us a 2-for-1 deal. It was pretty good. Good service. We ate at the Hooters restaurant and I wasn't impressed with the food, but the service was good.Casino: Don't bother. The slots are really tight day and night. The promotion of $100 in free spins is an indication of how the casino isn't serious about keeping people playing. The money is used on $2 slots and gone in about a minute.We probably won't stay here again. I think paying an extra few bucks to be on the strip in a more central location or downtown would be worthwhile."
235,372,"Dec 31 2007 	have stayed 3 times	Great hotel my wife and I always stay here. We travel to Vegas 3-4 times a year and search for the best rate and hooters always comes out on top. To be honest, this is my favorite hotel in vegas. The last time we were there, the hotel has declined a bit. nothing noticeable to the first time visitors. Beds are most comfortable in vegas(based of apporx 12 beds i have stayed in, in vegas)easy accesses to the strip through trop or mgm. the dam restaurent is the absolute best 3 am food in the world.cant wait to go back"
236,372,"Dec 30 2007 	Reasonable inexpensive accommodations	I admit it--I stayed here only because of the price. I couldn't believe that I could get a reasonable room in Las Vegas for only $26 per night, but that's what I paid. What I got in return was a clean room with a comfortable bed. They have internet access in the room, but it's not free and it wasn't working most of the times that I tried to use it.The location is next to Tropicana, about a 5-10 minute walk to the Strip. MGM Grand is directly across the street.I visited many casinos during my stay in LV and the one at Hooters had more smoke and more noise than any other. There would occasionally be someone screaming out loud for no apparent reason. Maybe it happens elsewhere, but here the sound travels throughout the casino.I'm not dissatisfied with the hotel becuase I got what I paid for, a clean and quiet room. However, I doubt that I will stay here again."
237,372,"Dec 27 2007 	Won't be back...	It was a clean place to sleep... that's really it. Terribly rude staff in Dan Marino's (a man got up and left it was so bad) and poor service in Hooters (a pretty face in orange shorts doesn't make up for the lack of service, one customer was so disappointed with the service she made a big scene). Walls are thin. Another family on our floor had children, and you could hear every word they said. The Hooters Casino Hotel website said there were &quot;complimentary coffee stations&quot; in the rooms. Our room didn't have one, and when we inquired about it, they gave us a blank stare, and told use we would have to gamble in the casino if we wanted free coffee. All with an air of rudeness.Stay away from the Tahiti Village booth. The Tahiti Village staff make you think it's part of the Owl Rewards Club and you tell them which room you're in, etc. Turns out that Tahiti Village is not connected to Hooters, and they just have a booth in the hotel. Tahiti Village is a timeshare property, and they will give you tickets to a show if you go to a two hour presentation (and put a deposit on your tickets). We mistakenly thought it was part of the Rewards Club and gave them our room number. THEN they gave us the timeshare rundown, and we weren't interested. They called our room on three separate occasions and left somewhat harassing messages. This isn't necessarily something Hooters can help, but they do allow Tahiti Village to have a spot within their hotel and market to (i.e., harass) their customers. Because we felt like we had to continually avoid they Tahiti Village harassers, and because of the general rudeness of the staff, we spent little time in the Hooters casino... go across the street to MGM. It's much nicer, and the staff are a lot friendlier. The two stars are for the clean room and a decent location. We won't be back, and don't recommend this hotel."
238,372,"Dec 26 2007 	Not worth the savings!!!	My girlfriend and I travel to Vegas 5-6 times a year and have stayed at many many hotels, both on and off the strip. I am definately not one to complain, the hotel for me is only a place to sleep...especially in Las Vegas, but our five nights here were a bit ridiculous. Despite my reservation they put us in a room with two beds (didn't make much sense) but having spent alot of time traveling, this was not my first experience with the matter. They were holding a package for me, which took about 30 minutes to find, but again, I understand these things happen. What bothered me was the staff. As a whole they were unfriendly and rude, and I'm not talking about the dealers in the skimpy outfits. It was the front desk, the waitresses, the bartenders that really had an opportunity to make or break the stay for me and they failed miserably. My girlfriend was so taken aback by the general lack of courtesy and kindness that she asked to speak with a manager, only to be given a VIP host. Polite as he was, he merely directed her to fill out a comment card about the matter. The Dan Marino restaurant was nice enough, though I had to interupt the waitress and the hostess from side conversations with their boyfriends to get them to seat us and take our order. The food took about 45 minutes to bring out, strange because we ordered 20 hot wings and celery sticks, and we waited so long for a check we ended up guessing on the bill and left cash on the table. The clientele was slummy and for the most part belligernatly drunk after about 10:00. For the women reading this review, my girfriend wouldn't walk the casino floor or bar without me. For the men traveling with women, if drunk guys hitting on your significant other over and over and over again bother you...find another hotel. And for you gamblers out there, yes the reviews are true, the casino floor is about the size of a basement. All in all, the service is not worth the savings, pony out a few more bucks and don't let the hotel and casino ruin the vacation--"
239,372,"Dec 8 2007 	Of ribs and chicks	Stayed here on the Saturday after Thanksgiving for a night, and having been there the night before feasting on the all you can eat ribs at Dan Marino's and almost lost some money trying to pay for the meal, I decided to stay at the property. I just came in at 10 am and asked the front desk guy if there's any rooms available. He said yes and gave me a good rate ($59) for it without me having to show my AAA card or saying anything for it. Made the cash deposit, and he gave me the keys to one of the bay view rooms. The location wasnt that great (next to the stairs and view of Airport), but the beds were the best i've stayed in a hotel in a loong time, and the decor is pretty hilarious, orange everywhere, a mini bar stool and table, and a mini tree. Service was great, the krispy kreme bought at the hotel store was awesome, and the girls there were great to talk to, especially the one at the store. Would return here if i want something no frills to stay in vegas, and definitely recommend it to everyone. Try Dan Marino's restaurant too while you're there....good food for a decent price."
240,372,Dec 3 2007 	Had a blast a Hooters!	My bestfriend and I just met up last weekend in Hooters for my 30th birthday and we had an absolute blast. The room was nice and very clean. The casino was excellent and you could actually get a drink when you gambled. We arrived several hours early for check-in and they still let us check into our room! The room service was excellent as well as our 2 o'clock in the morning dinner in the resturant. Being girls we had read some of the reviews and were a little afraid we might get bombarded with midlife crisis perverts but this wasn't the case at all! I would and will stay here again!
241,372,"Nov 29 2007 	A Hoot at Hooters	Hooters is a nice hotel - rated as mid standard, there are good and bad points i will list below but overall the stay represented excellent value for money and would recommend this as a great hotel.Hooters is just off the strip ( about 10 minutes walk past the Tropicana) to get to the nice part of the strip with New York and Excalibur and MGM) It is over the road from the MGM and it has a monorail to get you around the whole strip.The location isnt brilliant and you can feel a little isolated in the hotel.The hotel has good facilities, it has an amazing restaurant, lovely pool and spa area, it has a good range of slots- but the main tables are closed more often than not.The rooms are nice and spacious, big TV, large bathroom, was clean and comfortable.The carpet does the hotel no favours there are drinks stains everywhere and the negative reviews on here mirror this, however this was the only issue I found that could be something to moan about.Reception were friendly and informal, Room Service was nice and the staff were always helpful and approachable.I would recommend this hotel for anybody - the girls are stunning and friendly so guys will love staying and eating here. It isnt too formal and isnt too enormous. I found there was a real range of guests from families, youngsters to older people.The location isnt bad but another 10 minutes away and it would be an issue.OVERALL a thumbs up to a very enjoyable stay"
242,372,"Nov 6 2007 	What a great place	We looked for a hotel just off the strip, close to the action. We came to see the various cirque de soleil shows, and wanted to be close to the vemiues. Hooters filled the bill perfectly W.e had a large, clean, updated room where everything worked. No noise, no bugs, no smell, the elevator arrived within seconds on most occasions. It certainly wasn't posh, but we weren't paying posh prices. Only fault was that there wasn't a dresser for clothes, and you had to pile your stuff in the bottom of the tv cabinet. Staff was friendly, adn after a while, got to know us..We were across the street from MGM, and thought &quot;great&quot;, we can stay at the Hooters, and use the facilities of a &quot;real&quot; vegas hotel. After a few days, we realized how much better it was at Hooters, and ended up using their facilities. At MGM and other large casino hotels, you walk for what seems like miles to get to the various restaurants, shops, the pools etc, and wait in line. Everythign at Hooters was convenient - the pool was right next to the elevators, several restuarants and bars within a few steps, there wasn't the &quot;zshoom&quot; of hundreds of people in the lobby, restaurants, etc.. The casino was small and uninspiring, the mega casinos seemed to be a lot more fun. But we didn't come to gamble - our daily limit was $1.00 - and we had fun visiting many of the different casinos, all of which were welcoming, despite our limited wagers.Perhaps others had bad luck during their stay at Hooters - ours was really good.."
243,372,"Nov 5 2007 	great place	I went out there for a my bachelor party with 11 of my buddies. We went out for 3 nights, it was $75 total for each person for 3 nights which was awesome. If your looking to gamble and drink, this is the place because the drink girls were so quick to bring back your beverage and the tables were not expensive. People have said that the casino is small which it is but not once did it get too crowded at a table, there were always seats at the blackjack tables. The hotel was right off of the strip, right across from mgm and tropicana. I would recommend this hotel and plan on going again, and the hooter girls were too bad to look at either"
244,372,"Oct 24 2007 	Just OK	Stayed at Hooters for 3 nights in one of the &quot;bungalow&quot; rooms outside the main building overlooking the swimming pool. Very good king bed and one chair but almost no other furniture. Loud music from poolside from 8 am to 10 pm or so. The rate ($43/night) made it hard to resist for 3 nights in midweek. I might stay again in the off-season, but not on weekends, when the price jumps to $200+ per night."
245,372,"Oct 22 2007 	Good Service....needs some improvements	First, let me say that I am not usually too picky. Although I have been fortunate to stay at some very nice hotels on the strip, I have also stayed at my share of lower end hotels. Clean and comfortable are all I really care about. The check in process was friendly, quick, and we got the rooms/locations we requested. Although we were there at 1:00 our room was already available which was nice. The rooms are remodeled and attractive. There were no bad smells which I have experienced in non-smoking rooms in other Vegas hotels. The beds were very comfortable. The comforter and pillows were pretty, however after looking closer at the matching decorative bed pillows, we noticed small stains that appeared to be blood on them. Yuck! A few stains on the carpet but not enough to make a big deal of. The bathroom - needs work. The toilet barely flushed half the time. We were scared it was going to overflow. The tubs appear old and the drainage is slow but all in all, it's adequate. The Dam Restaurant and Dan Marino Restaurant were both very good with great service. Nobody in our group won anything at the casino although it was a nice comfortable size and not too smokey. The two gift shops offer some great unique Hooters gifts and they stay open quite late to make it easier to shop after the night out. A group of younger guys would probably be perfectly happy at this hotel. I think most others would be satisfied enough even with the few problems. How often are you really in your room anyway? It's Vegas!"
246,372,Oct 19 2007 	Decent but not great	I stayed at this hotel from Oct.15-18. The hotel overall wasn't bad. The casino was a bit small &amp; ranked very low in my book when I compared it to the other casinos on or next to the strip. I would refer this hotel to the 20-35 age male traveling groups &amp; no one else. Its like a Holiday Inn Express with a Hooters restaurant inside.
247,372,"Oct 18 2007 	FUN PLACE!!!!	We stayed five nights at Hooters returning last night,i had to come on here and defend all the horrible reviews i have read.that place is GREAT!!! well that is if u are not prententious or snobby u will have a great time. we had an &quot;ocean view&quot; room which was overlooking the pool. our room was very clean...spacious, cable tv, our beds were made and towels restocked.the ONLY downfall to the whole hotel was the noisy a/c unit and the dim lighting in the bathroom, but who really cares?!?the casino was alot of fun, although kind of dead at times, it was alot more personal and faster service than the other large casinos on the strip.it was right across from MGM, in a safe convienent location. cab rides are 10 bucks to the airport, Palms hotel etc... dont take the monorail it is a waste of time, and take forever to get to the station at MGM, spend the extra money and take cabs! the staff was very nice and the pool was really enjoyable.i layed out everyday, on the weekends the pool bar was open. the pool was pretty warm, with a warterfall and hot tub also.we would watch the people laying out from our window overlooking the pool, lots of ppl seem to stay at the pool until late.the check in and out was very fast. if i do go back to Las Vegas (which i will!!!!) i would stay there again,...it is alot of fun..and i love the orange hooters lighting everywhere!!!! we stayed at the Wynn one night which was beautiful, but i dont like staying in the mega hotels, too many ppl, takes to long to walk anywhere...Hooters is def recommended by me!"
248,372,"Oct 17 2007	Good to the next to last drop	We just returned from staying at the Hooters Casino in Las Vegas. We found the employees to be very friendly and it is in a great location. We had an enjoyable time until 5 minutes before we checked out. More on that later.We are among the unfortunate few who stayed at this hotel in recent years when it was still the San Remo. Based upon that, our expectations going in were very low. We were greeted by enthusiastic front desk people. Our &quot;Ocean Front&quot; room was spacious by Vegas standards, with a King size bed, desk, dressing area and bar table with stools. The bed was as comfortable as anything you'll find in more upscale hotels. The carpeting was stained in a few places, but otherwise, the room was clean with no offensive odors.The dressing mirror and counter was a nice touch, but there weren't any electrical outlets there. On the nearby desk, however, there was a powerstrip and computer connection.The bathroom was nice and again kept clean. We stayed three nights and the housekeepers did a nice job maintaining the room.For gamblers, there is a greater variety of table games than the casino offered when it first opened. The $10 minimums kept many of the Hooters clientele from gaming. Even on Friday and Saturday nights, you could find empty seats at the tables. The Casino Royale on the strip, with their lower table limits and liberal cocktail service, seems to cater more to the 21 to 35 year-olds that were staying at Hooters.The only hiccup came the morning we were checking out. Hooters has a 24 hour cafe called the DAM Restaurant. We arrived at 5:55 a.m. to eat breakfast. We were seated and the hostess put breakfast menus in front of us. We ordered two of the English Muffin breakfasts. The waitress said we couldn't have that because breakfast didn't start until 6:00. As we walked out, she apologized and asked if we could just wait five minutes. My question to her was, &quot;if you don't serve breakfast until 6, why give someone a breakfast menu?&quot; It's not like this is an inexpensive place. Their breakfast menu started at $8.95 and went up. We stayed here as part of a package and got a great deal. While the overall experience was good, it's not worth the $195 rack rate they advertised for a weekend night."
249,372,"Oct 12 2007 	Dirty Rooms	Hooters is dirty and yes there are bugs. I saw cockroaches and dead bug smears on the wall. This place should be shut down. The service is horrible, over 1 hour to get your bags delivered to your room. When I called the front desk I was told I couldnt expect speedy service. Rooms full of dust, they need a major cleaning."
250,372,"Oct 7 2007 	no Party at all	paid 110 USD plus tax for midweek stay Mon thru Wed.Hotel is ok but cant compte with the newer ones is Las Vegas.Stayed at the pool in the afternoon but it was quiet, no action at all.2 Hooters Waitresses behind the pool bar , dressed in pullovers since it was pretty cold in the shadow.Lots of Hooters Girls in the Restaurant, but the ones in Santa Monica were friendlier.Would stay again only at a lower rate.Greetings from Switzerland"
251,372,"Oct 6 2007 	Affordable and clean place to sleep while you see Vegas	My husband and I stayed at the hotel for an extended weekend over 4th of July. We booked our rooms ($303 for 5 nights) on the hotel website. They included Bobby Slayton tickets our first night in town. The check in was quick and friendly. The hotel has a fun theme and the rooms carry the tropical concept into them. They were clean and basic. Food at The Dam was okay and seemed to be many of the same offers as in the Hooters restaurant. The onsite steakhouse was okay, I wouldn't recommend it for a great steak lover but alright for the money.The pool area was very nice and a fun atmosphere. Try the &quot;Hooter Juice&quot; which was a frozen blended drink with a nice taste and quite a kick!I would recommend Hooters based on our experience for a clean, cheap and conviently located hotel. If you want a reasonable place to stay while you enjoy Vegas, this could work for you."
252,372,"Sep 30 2007 	Bed Bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	My brother and I stayed at Hooters Casino and Resort on Sept. 15th. I woke up at 4 a.m. with bugs crawling on me and in my bed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I went to the front desk to complain and all they would say is how do you want to pay for the room. They did'nt offer us a ride to another hotel or anything they did tell me the Orleans had rooms but this was all the way out by the RIO not close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay.We walked down the side street toward the strip and there were some people out who were following us and tried to get in an elevator with us by the Tropicana. I had to call a friend back home to help me find a room. What a HUGE HUGE problem for us. In Vegas and no hotel room at 4 a.m. not a situation I would ever recommend.I called the health department (CCH) on Hooters since I could'nt get anyone on the phone. They came out and several rooms were shut down due to the infestation of bed bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I have left several messages for the managers of the hotel and they must not of felt that this was that big of an issue because it took 2 weeks to get them on the phone. And the only reason I got anyone on the phone is I called the corporate office. Still no resolution . I don't know about you but I don,t like to have to wear bug infested clothes for the whole week I am in Las Vegas working a trade show and attending a wedding. I would only reccomend this hotel if you want to take some bed bugs home and be told this is not their fault...................."
253,372,"Sep 28 2007	Sexy hooters girls!!	The girls were great. Coming from Ireland it was some change to see these girls. (though wouldn't wanna live there)Check-in spot on, quick, stayed on 9th floor. Nice room, 2 double beds, v confortable. Cleaned every day if wanted. Food in restaraunts v good, salads even tasty. Casino was good too, small and friendlier.Only fault was the fact that access to reception was through whole building to get there.Location good, just beside mgm &amp; nyny.And again beautiful girls!"
254,372,"Sep 18 2007 	Welcomed by cockroach in bathroom	We went to Vegas for the Badgers vs. UNLV game. We were traveling with a group of about 6 couples from WI. My husband and I were the first to arrive in Vegas and Hooters on 9/5/07. We had been on planes since 5am and it was now 2pm our time and it was HOT in Vegas. All I wanted to do was get a cold beer and change my clothes. Upon arrival they have brilliantly placed the bar right next to check-in. I was able to satisfy my first desire by ordering a cold beer. Check in was great. Easy and quick. Although, for some reason we got 2 double beds instead of a king. No biggee, me and the hubby will snuggle. We proceeded to our room 806 in the Bayview tower. The room sort of look like the pictures. The decorations were all what I expected. What I didn't expect were the stains on the carpet or the rust on the bathtub. There was also cracked, peeling paint on our bathroom walls. The view left a lot to be desired. We could see the back of MGM along with the exhaust fans on top of the Hooters roof and parking garage. Not much for an inspiring view. However, really for the price and it being Vegas I wasn't expecting a palace. Just something clean and functional. I immediately opened my suitcase and grabbed some cooler clothes. I went into the bathroom to change. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something scurry across the wall into the corner by the mirror. I looked closer to find an insanely large COCKROACH. First of all, I have never seen a live one. Second, I have never seen anything that big except on like the Discovery Channel. Disgusting!! I made my husband kill it. I am not a prude, though. One bug isn't going to scare me off. Although, now I was inspecting every nook and cranny of that room. I didn't find any of it's friends so we carried on and left to go to Downtown Las Vegas for the day. We returned late that evening and ordered room service. Room service was good and prompt. I took a shower that night. Which led to another discovery. My shower curtain had mildew all over it. I was so tired and so sweaty from the 100 degree heat I just didn't even care. I carefully washed up trying desperately to not let any body part make contact with the shower curtain. Gross!!The next morning I was walking around the carpet barefoot while we made plans for the day. I went to get dressed and put on my shoes. As I leaned over to put on my socks I noticed the bottoms of my feet. To my horror they were dirty and black. Did I mention I took a shower the night before? Yep, all I walked on that morning was the carpet in our hotel room. Puke!!!This was my final straw. I was now just grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place. I called the Manager, Wendy. I told her about the bug, shower curtain, and my feet. She seemed very calm and non-responsive. Even started telling me how yes, bugs in the desert are bigger. They seek out moisture and sometimes come in through the vents. I kept thinking, ok, but I am EIGHT floors up!! Also, why is she telling me this like it is something that is common. If I am customer service or a Manager at a hotel I would not want my guests to think there are more bugs. I would act completely appalled and tell them that is unheard of and apologize profusely. She finally asked if I would like to change rooms. She said the set of rooms I stayed in are not as nicely renovated as the Oceanview ones. She could change my room and the bellman could help us. We just had to do it before 6pm that night. We already had plans for the day and were about to walk out the door. I told her I would call her back and we would try to meet the 6pm deadline. Problem was, we had completely unpacked our suitcases. I told her if we didn't meet her deadline then at the bare minimum I would like my shower curtain replaced. I mean really is that all she could offer. To inconvenience us more by making us pack back up and now moving into another room basically identical to ours, but &quot;possibly&quot; in better shape. We ended up going out with our group of friends, having loads of fun on the strip, and did not get back until late. Past the 6pm deadline. However, we did notice our shower curtain had been changed by the cleaning service. What we also did was from the night before when we ordered room service was accidentally drop a french fry by our bed. We joked that morning about it and I said that would be my test to see if they cleaned it up. Yeah, it was still there. Beds were made. Towels and toiletries replaced, but that stupid french fry was still there. This became our gauge on how well the cleaning crew performed. Yep, that french fry never moved the entire 5 days we were there!!!I, personally, don't think they vaccum. I never saw a vaccum by one of the cleaning carts. I did see a man vaccuum the hallway once outside our door, but that was it. I also question whether they sweep the bathroom. I dropped a rubberband one morning and the next day it was still there. I think they simply change your towels, empty trash cans, give you toiletries, wipe the sink/tub, and call it a day. Even glasses and empty soda cans weren't thrown out for us. Like they thought we were going to the local recycler or something. I don't know. (??) In WI our hotels clean top to bottom. Maybe that isn't the norm in Vegas. No, that cannot be this is like our 6th time in Vegas and never have I seen such poor cleaning in a casino hotel. Especially a hotel that is realitively new to Vegas, has a well established brand, and is trying to make a name for itself as a Vegas strip hotel competitor. Unbelievable. Therefore, if you like creepy crawlers, black dirty feet, stained up carpets, and living in trash. By all means stay at Hooters. Its' cheap, but you have to be willing to comprimise on clean. Trust me your not getting any sort of Vegas Strip luxury hotel staying here. YIKES!! ** We took pictures. I am in process of getting them developed. I will post them as soon as I do. The only thing we missed was the bug. My husband killed it and flushed it down toilet before I could snap a picture. Seriously, it was the size of a walnut. Makes me shiver thinking about it. --Sincerely a Grossed Out Badger Fan"
255,372,"Sep 2 2007 	Celebrating my daughters 21st b-day at Hooters	We arrived the evening of her 21st b-day.  Check-in was quick and we made our way to the room to drop off luggage. We booked a standard two bed smoking room. Our room overlooked the pool area and at night it was pretty with the lights sparkling over the water.Our room was very clean, the decor is average, the beds were very comfortable and more importantly it was very quiet. My only complaint was when we showered as the drains were plugged and it became half shower and half bath. Our room was serviced every day by 2 pm.The Casino is quite small and that's a bonus as you could never get lost. We found the dealers to be very friendly and helpful. My daughter was forever getting carded and security helped out by giving her a bracelet to wear so everyone would know she was of legal age.The food was average but the coffee at the Dam restaurant was very good.All in all it was exactly what I expected and I would stay there again because of the affordability."
256,372,"Aug 22 2007 	Fastest drinks in Vegas Baby!	We've stayed at the Luxor, and granted it's a whole different crowd, the service here was much faster and more personal. After visiting all the &quot;Big&quot; casinos for a little gambling we always came back to little ol' Hooters for the largest winnings and fastest drink service. By the way, I didn't find a better Cosmo anywhere in Vegas. The rooms are comfortably appointed and quiet. The view from our room on the 6th floor tower was non-existent. We booked directly because a family member is an employee of Hooter's in Tennessee and the casino gives employees a hefty discount. Even if we had paid full price it was a bargain. The Dam Restuarant is killer for all the food and service. But don't even bother with the wings at Hooter's restuarant, they suck big time, no flavor and ice cold! But do enjoy the Peanut Butter Pie. While the casino is much smaller than most, it's a &quot;hoot&quot; to visit."
257,372,"Aug 20 2007 	Dirty and old but cheap and good location...you make the call.	My husband and I decided to go on a last minute trip to Las Vegas for the first weekend in August. I had a few hours to find a place to stay for that same night and the next one. Cost and location were both factors, so we ended up with the Hooters hotel because it was the cheapest we could find the closest to the strip. For those two factors, this hotel was great. We booked directly with the hotel and paid only $79 for the Friday and $99 for the Saturday. Also, the location wasnt much different from the time we stayed at the MGM Grand. The other nice thing was that after walking through all the huge monstrosity places, it was nice to come back to a place where it was easy to find everything and you could get to your room without a three-mile hike. For most everything else, though, my reaction is, eh.Though this has nothing to do with the hotel itself, I have to say that if anyone ever tells you they go to Hooters for the wings, it is a lie, lie, lie. I know thats kind of a joke to begin with, but I found out it really is true--their wings are terrible! Greasy and flavorless--both at the Dam Restaurant and the actual Hooters. (If you want wings, stick with Buffalo Wild Wings.) I know it's convenient, but don't bother eating at the hotel. (I have to say, though, we didn't try the Dan Marino's steakhouse place, so I can't comment on that.)Anyhow, back to the hotel. The outside and public areas seem to have been dressed up since it was the San Remo Hotel, and I think the rooms are a tad nicer, but the hallways and elevators are like something from the Bates Motel. Id read other reviews that mentioned how depressing the hallways were and thought, Who gives a crap about the hallways? Well, as it turns out, I do. They were that gross. The carpet is threadbare and stained badly. When I woke up early desperate for non-alcoholic liquid (too much salt from all those margaritas, I guess!), I walked down the hall to the soda machine with my two bucks. The machines dollar reader was broken. So I took the elevator down to the next floor. That soda machine would only take exact change. Finally I went down another floor and got my drink. Then when I went to go back up, the elevator wouldnt work correctly. The door would start to shut and then would open againonly to start to shut and then stop and open again. This started to make me nervous, so I hopped out and tried to find stairs. I couldnt find a way to get from one floor to another. So I went back to the elevators and prayed that this time, a different one would come (which it did). We were later in the same elevator and another couple said it was acting really screwy every time they used it, too. I know its an old building, but elevators that dont work right make me nervous.Something else that I wasnt impressed with was the fact that there were hairs in the shower. Not just onethat I can understand, it happens. But numerous hairs that appear to be from different parts of the body? Yuck. Also, the in-room safe was broken (we didnt bother to ask anyone to fix it, though).Something that is part good/part bad is the fact that upon checkout, we were billed for a meal we didnt eat. (I am SO GLAD I checked every item on the printout!) It turns out that while we were eating breakfast at the Luxor, someone else was eating breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants and charging it to our room. The good part was that the guy at the front desk immediately credited us back for it and was very nice.I know this review has a lot of complaints. Im not normally a very picky person when it comes to hotels (I swear). What bothered me here is that it seems like they just tried to slap a coat of paint on everything and present it as way nicer than it was. A lot of the problems I saw would be easily remedied with just some time and attention: maintain the pop machines and safes, make sure the rooms are cleaned well, wash the windows every once and awhile, etc. Overall, I understand that I got what I paid for, and thats o.k. We had a good location and a bed to crash in for cheap. Its just that next time, Ill spring for something a little nicer."
258,372,"Aug 20 2007 	Shouldn't have read the reviews here first...	We booked the final two nights of our week long vacation at Hooters (Aug 13-15) as the price was very good compared to most of the strip properties (as there was a large convention in town) I always read the reviews on here prior to staying at any property and given the majority of favorable reviews I went in thinking quite positive about this property. (with an air of aprehension) Well, I should have known better. My wife and I are fun, outgoing people and we had a terrible time at this property. First the pool area which is made out to be lavish is really a snooze fest (this may have been due to it being a weekday) but the worst part was they stop cocktail service almost as soon as the sun disappears around 4 pm. We like to go out for late afternoon swims, and as such if we wanted to enjoy a beverage we had to walk inside the Hooters restaurant to get a drink (where the service was incredibly slow, although the girls were very friendly, albeit not as attractive as we expected) The casino itself is small, with limited table game options, and lacking of the energy/atmosphere of most of the strip properties. We found the two pit bosses and non Hooters girl dealers we came in contact with to be cold, thus we didn't spend much time at the tables here. (the Hooters Dealers were much friendlier, and easier on the eyes) The rooms themselves (we upgraded to a suite) were ok, there was a 42 plasma in the living room, with a small bar area with a fridge (which kept drinks very cold). The beds were actually quite comfortable. That is where the good parts of the room ended. The windows looked as though they hadn't been cleaned since the San Remo days, they were like that scene from My Cousin Vinny (very, very dirty for those who can't recall), the carpets and couch were stained extensively, the soundproofing was non-existent. However all of these items could have potentially been overlooked if not for the showers. The room had two showers (which may have been nice) however there is something seriously wrong with their water tank/pressure system. In the course of a 10 minute shower, my wife and I would be routinely scalded and frozen in numerous intervals (we took 3 showers and this occured every time, to both of us) All in all, I guess given the price if we need a place to sleep, and they fixed the showers we may stay there again. The &quot;off strip&quot; location is no problem, you spend very little time getting out of the hotel as it is so small, and MGM and the monorail is right across the street. Also you don't have the outrageous taxi lines you do at other strip hotels. However we will most likely pony up the additional $$$ and stay center strip next time as we did at the start of our trip at Planet Hollywood."
259,372,"Aug 10 2007 	Can't go wrong at Hooters	We stayed at Hooters for 3 nights and had a great time. The room was booked online at their website a months or so before arrival and we managed to get them for $37 a night.Upon arrival we were not sure what to expect for that price but we were very pleasantly surprised, the room was big, had a great King Size bed, big TV, our own safe and a great and clean bathroom.Sure, it's not flashy, but it must be the best deal in Las Vegas, it's only 2min away from the Strip and casinos such as the MGM and New York New York. The room was cleaned daily and the pool looked really nice as well (never used it though).We will definately stay at Hooters again if we return to Las Vegas!!"
260,372,"Aug 7 2007	Overall OK but some problems	I stayed at Hooters July 26-28 as part of a private Parrothead Party. The hotel offered special rates for our group, so can't complain about the price. During our stay, one of the three elevators to our tower ceased to work. It was not repaired while we were there. The hall carpet was stained and appeared to be filthy, found someone else's hair in the bathtub, and generally was not so clean. In the hotel's defense, the beds were very comfortable and clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful, there was a nice pool area and tiki bar. Would not be my first choice of places to stay in Vegas, but was convenient for our group's party."
261,372,"Aug 6 2007 	good place to stay on a budget	I stayed here for 2 nights ( a friday and Sat night) and while it's not an MGM Grand it is a great place to stay for under $130/night. I booked a week in advance and couldn't expect much on a budget. It's in a good location yet you don't have to pay for being right on the Strip. It's 3 blocks from the strip. I could have paid less for the stratosphere which is supposedly right on the strip but in my opinion the strat is in a bad location far away from the major casinos. There is a friendly atmosphere at hooters and I was definately hesitent after reading the reviews. The casino is smaller but that was ok with me. The elevators were normal with the exception of one time where we had to wait 4 minutes or so.. big deal. We even ate at the hooters restaraunt (defying the negative reviews) and it was ok. It is hooters people, have you ever had a fancy meal at a hooters? It was decent food, no wait, friendly girls and good service. I would stay here again."
262,372,"Aug 3 2007 	Great Time!	My husband and I and another couple choose Hooters for the price and were not disappointed. We stayed there 7/20 to 7/22Check in was fast and friendly, even got free tickets to the comedy show there!Rooms were clean and nice, our view was of the strip!The pool was fun and lively but the pool service was poor, we had to get our own drinks even thou there were several girls walking around.The casino was fun, youthful and had great service.The wings were great and so was the Key Lime pie at the Dam resturant.We will stay there again!"
263,372,"Aug 3 2007 	DIRTY!	I have never written a review about anything. I feel very strongly that people need to know my version of the truth about this hotel. First of all, I would like to say that I have no complaints about the staff. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. They were also very eager to compensate for our dissatisfaction. Upon arrival at the hotel, everything seemed fine. The reservations were correct (thank you Vegas.com). The room availability at the time of check in was either two queen beds or one king bed in the bungalows. A bungalow, overlooking the pool, sounds fun, huh?! We give our bags to the bellhop and head up to our room. The room was located outside of the hotel/casino structure. Walking through the pool area was a must to get to it. We opened the door to get in the building and immediately were taken aback by the smell in the hallway. It smelled just like a deep fryer, as my husband liked to say. I think it smelled more like someone had died! Being optimistic, we continue on to the room. We open the door. It is quite dingy and dark in the room. We stayed there for about an hour and a half until our luggage showed up at the room (we did have to call for it). Then we headed out to eat dinner (our first meal since breakfast)--over dinner we decide that we can't stay in the room. It was just too dirty for our standards. We go talk to the receptionist and she was very accommodating. She said in about an hour she would have a room for us with a king size bed in the ocean view rooms. We were excited about this! She comes and gets me in an hour and my husband and I gather our things from the old room and move them into the new room. We immediately attempt to turn on the air conditioning, and what luck would have it, it wasn't working! (las Vegas with no a/c--not going to happen!) Then I realize the sink in the room does not drain! We call for someone to come fix it. After 2 phone calls and 30 minutes later, the mechanic arrives. He fixes the a/c (thank God) and attempts to fix the sink. He used this contraption that forced air through the pipes to remove any clogs there might be. This device managed to spray dirty (leftover) sink water onto the mirror and counter space. The man doing the work used the room towels to haphazardly wipe up the mirror and sink. I do have to say, for the quick fix it did work for about 24 hours....then the sink went back to overflowing if the water was running too long. (we did not want to take the effort or our time to have someone come fix it)The following day (after being at the pool all day) we come back inside to shower and get ready for the evening. My husband showers first and then I hop in....while I'm in the shower the lights int he bathroom turn off!!! (not any other outlet or light in the entire room)--so I am condemned to taking a shower in the dark. With all of this aside the rooms (both of them) were filthy. There was a layer of dust on the artificial plants as well as the night stands and clock/radio. The carpet looked as though it hadn't been vacuumed in a month. I was thoroughly disgusted."
264,372,Aug 2 2007 	Loved it at Hooters	My wife and I just spent July 22nd thru the 27 at Hooters.What can we say other then this place is incrediable.If you are looking to relax and have a very down to earth stay this is the place for you. No snobs expecting something for free.The rooms are very comfortable. Beds are so soft !!The only thing I would say is the water pressure was not that great. I do not know if staying on the 19th floor had something to do with this. It was not a big deal though.So in closing if you like down to earth and you just want to relax this is the place for you. If you want upper class and people to kiss your butt around every corner go to the Belliago or Ceasers.
265,372,Jul 31 2007 	no pool	I stayed at Hooters in Las Vegas only to find out that we were unable to use the pool for 2 days due to a private party.We had the option to use the pool Next door but if I wanted to use that pool I would have booked a room next door. Instead of Paying a $20.00 donation fee
266,372,"Jul 30 2007	Great Hoot!	Okay, Hooters isn't the Mirage. They live up to their motto of &quot;Delightfully tacky, yet unrefined&quot; but I would encourage you to take it for what it intends to be. The price was terrific for $50.00 on a weeknight I had a very nice room, everything was clean, and beautiful ladies everywhere I looked. This is a great place for guys and fun couples who don't want to have to remain casual and have a good time. The pool area was very nice and staffed by some incredibly beautiful and attentive ladies. Food was good at every price and prices for everything were reasonable by Vegas standards. It's an easy two block walk to the strip and I never felt concerned at night. It's impossible to beat for the price and I intend to return. Did I mention the beautiful ladies everywhere?"
267,372,"Jul 24 2007	Rooms leave much to be desired	I stayed here for 3 nights with my husband and best friend over the weekend. When we first arrived we got our room (no problems there) and headed to the elevators. We were in the Bay View Tower and only one of the two very slow elevators was working. When it finally came to get us, we went up to our floor and walked to our room. I did notice the carpets in the hallways were stained and everything just felt dirty. The room was ok. We had a view of the pool with a tiny balcony (one person size) and the two beds we requested. When we left the room we waited 5 minutes for the elevator to come get us before trying the stairs. The signage was very poor and while we were able to figure out a passage to the outside (by the parking garage) we couldn't get to the lobby level/casino. So, we had to go back up the stairs to wait for the elevator again.That night, after a long evening of drinking, we came up to bed. I woke up many times throughout the night due to the incredibly uncomfortable beds. All-in-all a pretty restless night of sleep. Then, at 12 PM (I know, it is noon, but it is Vegas), we were awakened to blaring music! A band had started playing at the pool and there was no chance of sleep after that b/c everything could be heard.The rest of the time was no better. The hotel became more and more trashed as the weekend went on and never seemed to be cleaned up. They did the individual rooms but the hallways remained disgusting. On Sunday morning, a trashcan of vomit was placed in the hall by the elevators and although I saw the maids several times all morning, it was still there when we checked out at 2 PM.On the bright side, they do have good drinks, the Nipper Juice will knock you over with 4 kinds of rum and the pool is a good time. I also appreciated the location b/c it was so easy to get to MGM and the monorail. I am a firm believer that a room is a room in Vegas and just a place to pass out...but if you can't get to your room (or out of it) due to slow elevators, you can't sleep b/c your bed is uncomfortable and a band is playing and you hate walking thru the halls, maybe it is better to stay somewhere else."
268,372,"Jul 22 2007 	will stay only here	from the moment we got to hooters, we loved it. we received excellent service from all the friendly staff---bradley you're the best. we arrived at 11:30---checkin time is 4:00. i asked for a quiet area(i can't sleep)---we werre given room 1630. immediately--NO WAIT!!! the rooms are nice, clean, and the beds are so comfy. there was a safe, coffeemaker, table and chairs. huge towels and great water pressure.there are 2 pools and 3 jacuzzis--plenty of chairs. the only downside is the building blocks the sun around 3:30 but by then you have had enough sun.we ate ate the dam restaurant once, got 99cents shrimp cocktail by signing up for a players card. we ate at hooters twice. enjoyed meals and service. the talapia was excellent.the casino is small---didn't bother us---the girls brought drinks before we could even finish. figured the crown royal i drank made up for the money i lost in the machines which wasn't much---had fun playing.our last day they were taping the tv show &quot;the best damn sports show period&quot;. we did not have to get out of the pool--but the manager Kim asked us to give up our chairs for awhile---he gave us drinks and made sure we got our chairs when they were through. nipper juice is awesome.we had a 5:30 flight so i asked for a room extension. would have gotten one till 3 but only took it till 2 because a friend was taking us to lunch. no chargethis was our 8th trip to vegas. you can keep those monstrosities on the strip. it took us less time to get to the strip and our pool than if we would have been staying on the strip. we have stayed at tropicana, flamingo, harrahs, new frontier, monte carlo, aladdins, and ballys. this, by far, was the best. it is not a 5 star hotel---but we got 5 star service. i wonder if those 5 star places with the 5 star prices really give you what you pay for. hooters will see us again."
269,372,"Jul 22 2007 	perfect	Booked a bungalow room (49.00) and was upgraded to ocean view room. Room was clean and everything worked fine.Casino was small, but I was always able to get on blackjack table. The dealers were very nice and better looking than your normal dealers. The dam restaurant was good for a late night breakfeast and the other restaurants were also nice. Just a short walk to the strip and the monorail is close by. MGM, NY NY and Excaliburs are all near by and offer a wide variety of entertainment and restaurants. We ate at Excalibur, Dicks last resort and roundtable buffets, both were excellent.I am planning a return to Vegas in 3 months and will stay at Hooters again then."
270,372,"Jul 19 2007 	Spend the extra money and stay somewhere else	I booked three rooms three months in advance for the weekend at Hooters. After reading that the hotel seems to get your rooms wrong regularly I decided to call about four hours before our arrival and verify the rooms we requested were in fact the rooms we would receive. I was told no problem over the phone. We arrived (3 couples) and we given all wrong rooms. Two rooms were smoking (non smoking was requested) and one room has two beds (one was requested). We were told this was all the hotel had available. Once in our room we called the main desk and begged to be moved (the smell was awful), we were moved down the hall to a room with two beds. It was our anniversary weekend and did not want to sleep seperate. Called again and was told our prior room was all that was available. Now lets talk about the view from the rooms: second floor, our view was of an electrical box and the parking structure, our friends had a view of the ventalation system with a bunch of cigarette butts outside the window. Not very pretty. The lay out of the rooms were nice and the beds were comfortable. Casino was to small, played at other casinos that had tables open. Lastly they were filming a TV show at the pool and the pool was not open until 2:30 on Saturday, not very good when it's 115 outside. we were credited $30 dollars to the resturant (whooo hew)!!!!!"
271,372,"Jul 16 2007 	Good Time at Hooters	Went there for a men's weekend with some friends. True to form it is delightfully tacky. Hit $300 on the first slot machine I played so that helped set the tone (donated it back through the course of the weekend). The rooms were very clean and had no complaints with them. I would have to say that for a hotel just off the strip it is a great place to stay for those on a budget. The pool area was lively if you try to remember you are staying at HOOTERS and not the Four Season's. By that I mean the people are fun but shall we say adventuresome. So if that is what you like this is where you will find it. The casino was much smaller than I anticitpated with not enough tables for my taste, but there were plenty of slots. The bar toward the back of the property is a greatplace to kick off an evening and if you are looking to drink all day, make sure you look like a tourist and by the yard at the bar. $25 for a gigantic Jack and Coke with refills for $15. One hell of a deal. The breakfast buffet was OK but not spectacular. They have omelettes made to order and the potatoes are great. Could not find one person working tere that was having a bad day and everyone seemed friendly and helpful. One nice thing about the location is right across the street is the MGM. We all got day passes for the tram and took it to the far north end of the stip and worked our way back on foot. Well worth the price compared to how long it would take for you to get there by cab."
272,372,"Jul 15 2007 	Loved Hooters	My husband called Hooters hotel back in March to ask if they could do anything special for our 12th anniversary in June. They told him to book a tower room and they would upgrade. When we arrived , (no waiting line) they had upgraded us to a two-room, hot tub suite. The room was beautiful!! The king size bed was soft and very comfortable. The L-shaped couch along with the (42 inch?) flat screen TV made you feel right at home. It was like a small apartment and it had two bathrooms. The casino itself was small- not like the mega-hotels, and had a great atmosphere. The servers came around often. The only bad thing was that the maintenance workers and housekeeping had to use the guest elevators as there are no service elevators for them to use."
273,372,"Jul 14 2007 	Great atmosphere at Hooters!	I stayed at the Hooters Casino Hotel in mid-June and loved it. Decor in the casino and the room was typical of a Hooters restaurant with lots of orange vinyl and natural wood. A little jarring to look at compared to other luxurious hotels in Vegas, but it grows on you. If you are driving, the parking ramp is immediately adjacent to the hotel and access is very convenient. Driving in and out on Tropicana is a snap. Although technically off the strip, it is a 5 minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from your hotel room. I have stayed at Bally's, Luxor, Harrahs, and other strip properties where it took longer just to get the elevator down.My room was in the &quot;Oceanview&quot; tower (used to be the silver tower when it was San Remo) and it was large, comfortable, clean, and exactly what I requested. The hallways and elevators are a little beaten and dreary, but the room itself was great. I arrived 2 hours early for Sunday check-in and they were able to give me the King/no-smoking room I requested. In contrast to older reviews I read here, all the staff I met seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable.Pool area was very lively and had a live reggae-type band playing on Sunday. I didn't see much cocktail service walking around, but service was fast at the pool bar. I thing large drafts were $5 and frozen drinks were $8 - $10. There were a lot of lounge chairs and benches surrounding the pools, and it seemed some were always open. The hooters restaurant has a porched area overlooking the pool where you can get food. Crowd was mostly couples in their late 20's - early 40's and not the drunken bachelor party group I was expecting, but it was a Sunday.Casino is a little small, but they have all the table games and a good variety of slots. I found 9/6 JOB video poker and decent pay tables on Dueces Wild. BJ was mainly $10 minimum . . . I never saw lower. There were a lot of 6/5 tables and the placards stating that are small, so look carefully before you sit down. Cocktail service was speedy wherever I was sitting.To summarize: This is a 3-star place with a really fun atmosphere and decent rooms, food, and gaming. It is a great place for the price, close enough to be considered on the Strip, and I plan on returning with my wife for our next vacation."
274,372,"Jul 12 2007 	What a great deal!	My girlfriend (40) and I (41) stayed 5 days/4 nights July 1-5 in a &quot;Poolside Bungalow Room&quot; for $50/nt and really loved it. We were in room 264 overlooking the center of the pool area. No complaints on cleanliness. Room decor resembles a Hooters restaurant right down to the orange barstool seats. (there was a sitting chair as well). Bed was fine (a little soft). Room was large. It had a small balcony overlooking the pool area. The pool was busy, but never too crowded (get a spot under the waterfall for a &quot;cool&quot; spot in the shade). The food was so, so. The breakfasts were good in the Dam Restuaurant (didn't try Dan Marino's). Always room at the craps table - $5 min during the week. The Nipper Juice at the Pool Bar was very good (a slurpy with a kick!).Such an incredible price for the location - behind the Tropicana across from the MGM (and monorail stop). I bet our walk to the Strip was faster than many of the rooms inside the MGM! 4 nights for 200 bucks was a steal.Plus, ya get Hooter's girls everywhere for no extra charge!See the Vegas Forum for additional info on our Hooters experience and our trip."
275,372,Jul 10 2007 	Happy Birthday at Hooters!	My friends and I had a great time at the Hooters Hotel. The atmosphere was laid back and lots of fun. The rooms are comfortable and staff was wonderful. Loved the pool party. It was definitely a Happy Birthday.
276,372,"Jul 10 2007	Great Place to Stay	After reading the prior reviews, I also thought that I might have made a mistake in booking at Hooters. However, that was not the case at all. I have stayed at many casinos on the Strip and Hooters has delivered the best service yet. The Hooters girls were always helpful and friendly, as were the front desk and bell hops. The restaurants, especially Hooters and Dan Marion's steakhouse were excellent. The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable (loved the beds). The casino floor was smaller than those on the strip, but in this way it was no overwhelming, and in some ways, more fun. The table games were very relaxed with the Hooter girl dealers offering advice and adding to the fun of the game. The pool was great and the drinks served while gambling were much larger than those served at the Strip casinos. An added bonus was that there were $5 Blackjack tables next door at the Tropicana, in case you did not particularly want to &quot;lose your shirt&quot; that day. All in all, a wonderful experience. I would absolutely stay there again. If i were to mention any negatives, I would say that the elevators were slower than I'm used to and that the Sports Book was tiny."
277,372,"Jul 6 2007 	Fun!	I stayed at Hooters hotel a couple weeks ago and was very pleased. The rooms were very nice w/ big soft beds. The casino size was just perfect and you didnt have to worry about getting lost like you did at the other big casinos. It had a very nice pool, but be there before 3pm or the sun gets blocked by the hotel and it gets chilly. It also had a great location, just a block off the strip. one negative thing i would say is DONT eat at the hooters restaurant. The service is terrible and rude. We ate there twice and realized it was the biggest mistake we could have made. It was very spendy for the food you got, and the waitreses were anything but friendly. Overall i would def. stay here again, but avoid the Hooters restaurant."
278,372,Jul 4 2007	Terrible Hotel	Stayed between July 1 and 3. Called to confirmed non-smoking room the day before and were not available when we got there. Stayed at room 310 where the carpet was dirty and got stains. The bathroom got peeling paint and cheap fixtures and rusted out valve behind the toliet with broken tiles. Only one elevator was working the whole time while 2 others were out of order. No AC in the hallway or elevator. Noisy AC in the wall. Lack of Management!
279,372,"Jul 4 2007 	Hooterific Time	After looking at some of the reviews on this page I was expecting a real dump. That was not the case. The hotel is not the Wynn or Bellagio, but it also doesn't come with the attitude either. It was clean, and the staff were very helpful. When we checked in there was a bit of a line, so the cocktail waitresses offered us free drinks. Way to pass the short time! The Hooters restaurant and the Dam Restaurant are both delicious (especially after a heavy night of partying). The concierge was very helpful, and gave us good advice on where to go on a Tuesday night. The rooms were very very comfortable and equally clean. The beds are better than in any hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. The pool is a decent size and has a small waterfall. On our last day I asked for late check out and they had no problem. All this for only 50 bucks a night through the Hooterific Package. This hotel is not on the strip but if you just walk across to the MGM you can board the monorail anywhere on the main drag. I definitely recommend this place."
280,372,"Jul 3 2007 	Hooters Las Vegas Nevada	We arrived at Hooters on Thursday and I really enjoyed staying there. The rooms were very nice and had very soft beds. I loved the casino. It wasnt huge like the rest of them, so you could find your way around easily. I would NOT recommed going to the Hooters restaurant. The service was TERRIBLE. My group ate there twice and we had to literally go and find a waitress to help us. It was pretty spendy and not that good. They girls looked like they were about 12 years old also. So if you dont want terrible service and spendy prices, go elsewhere!The elevators were all working good and there was never a line to get on. The hotel was also in a very good area, not too far from the strip. The pool was very beautiful, but the sun is blocked by the hotel early, so you need to go to the pool about 10am to get a good few hours in. So overall i would for sure stay there again, but i would NEVER go to the Hooters restaurant ever again there!"
281,372,Jul 2 2007	LOVED IT...	I was a bit nervous...my husband and I wanted to go to vegas for our 10 year wedding anniversary and we got an incredible deal on this hotel. I read some reviews...got some feedback from others who have been to vegas (this was our first time) and so I was still nervous but bit the bullet. We had a WONDERFUL time. We got there early and rooms were not ready..you just drop the bags at the bell desk and off you go...we didn't mind the hotel at all..the room was clean the bed was comfy..and we didn't spend an enormous amount of time in our room...Some drawbacks...the elevator..very slow...it got stuck once with my hubby in it...and the water in the shower would go from scaulding hot to cold the entire shower...but its an older place...again for the money something I was willing to tolerate...we would love to go back and the location of this hotel is close to the airport..and also right off the strip..so we walked a lot to and from the bigger casinos...Its not something to be afraid of...the staff was nice..we had a great time and you will too!
282,372,"Jun 30 2007 	Had a w'owl of a time	Have just spent 2 weeks at the Hooters Casino Hotel. Booking in was quick, but we did have to wait until 4.00pm to get into our room.The room was very clean, well set out with a large TV and enough space for clothing. The bathroom was adequate, the one cup at a time coffee machine was in there, , but there was plenty of room for it next to the sink.. The room had a bar stools and table in the corner, which we didn't use much, rather be sat in a real bar.The bed was extra large and extremely comfortable, very soft. The only down side of the room was the noisy air conditioning unit, which rattled away during the day and night.The casino itself was small by comparison with most of the others on the strip, and the bars in the casino got very noisy in the evenings, But the hotel does cater for the younger crowd, so the noise was to be expected.The pool was nice if you could get near it, we struggled to get a sunbed most of the time, you had to be down there by 9.00 to get one. No-one asked for any ID to get into the pool area, so anyone could have used the pool.The hotel was only a five minute walk to the strip, and a five minute drive to the airport, we were ripped off by a taxi driver on the journey from the airport to the hotel, so make sure you only pay around 10 dollars for the trip.We found the beer expensive in the hotel bars, much cheaper at other casino's like Bills .Overall the hotel was clean and the room adequate, but we didn't feel we could relax by the pool or enjoy the casino because of the noise."
283,372,"Jun 22 2007 	Excellent Value for Money - Good Location	I was slightly concerned about my choice of hotels after reading the mixed reviews but I neednt have worried.The staff at check-in were helpful and friendly. We were told that they didnt have any king-size non-smoking rooms available but would we be happy to accept a room with two double beds instead with the option of changing to a king-size the next day. After a long flight though we were more than happy to accept this. The room was fine  a good size with very comfortable but very high beds. We had an excellent view of the strip and it was quiet (well, except for the air-conditioning unit which was annoyingly loud!). The rooms are nicely decorated but they are obviously not to Bellagio or Wynn standard, but you cant really complain when youre only paying 25 per night! Although everybody thinks of Hooters as a party hotel we didnt experience any excessive noise. One of the lifts was out of order for a day or so, which proved a bit of a pain, and they arent air-conditioned so when youre stopping on every floor from the 10th in a small lift it can get a bit stuffy!The hotel itself doesnt have a huge amount of amenities but enough to keep you happy. The casino is small and friendly and it makes a nice change from the other super casinos on the strip. There are plenty of Hooter girls to be seen although some seem more interested in chatting to customers rather than serving drinks.Id definitely recommend staying here, especially if youve stayed in one of the bigger hotels before and fancy a change."
284,372,"Jun 21 2007 	Great Value 	My wife and I stayed at Hooters Hotel and Casino from June 17, 2007 through June 20, 2007 in room 833. We took my father to Las Vegas as a Fathers Day present and he stayed in room 853. Having never even dined at a Hooters Restaurant and with my wifes apprehension about staying at a Hooters establishment, we were both very pleasantly surprised and pleased with our accommodations.As I needed to purchase two rooms, price was a major factor in selecting Hooters. I found a great deal on Expedia for only $33 a night! This was for a 3 star hotel that had a good ranking on TripAdvisor (no. 68 out of 240). The total price for two rooms for 3 nights plus fees and taxes was only $221.00. This was an extremely great value. To have stayed elsewhere on the strip at any decent hotel would have doubled the cost of the entire trip. I liked the location of the hotel as it was right across from a monorail stop at MGM Grand and down the street from a mini-mart. The elevators were all working and I usually did not have to wait long for one.We checked in at 2:00 pm and were able to secure rooms before the official check-in time of 3:00 pm. We only had to wait about 8-10 minutes to be checked in. We were given smoking rooms, but as a nonsmoker I could not detect the slightest odor of cigarette smoke in my room. Our room was very clean, spacious, and did not show any signs of age. I liked the nice touch of putting large plants in the room, but felt the wooden dcor was a little tacky. The rooms had a nice view of the hotels on the southern part of the strip (Luxor, MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Tropicana). The television had a large selection of channels and was nicely positioned right in front of the bed. The bathroom was very clean and was of average size that came with all the usual amenities including a hair dryer and vanity mirror. The bed was very comfortable, but the air conditioner was a little noisy. I did not hear any noises from the adjoining rooms. The rooms were serviced every day, but some maids were a little too quick to open the door after knocking. The staff of the hotel was very polite and friendly. The drink service at the gaming tables and pool area was very good. I very much enjoyed the pool area, which had a lively atmosphere. There were two pools and two hot tubs. However, one of the hot tubs was cold all four days we stayed there. There were plenty of towels and security was always on guard. We ate at the Dam Restaurant for lunch. The food was good, but service poor. I heard some of the staff members state that the restaurant was reduced to a skeleton staff to save money, which has had a proportional impact on customer service. The prices were very affordable. I appreciated the fact that the casino table limits were as low as $10.00. I walked across the parking lot to play Blackjack at the Tropicana where table limits were as low as $5.00. Overall I very much enjoyed my stay and believe I got an excellent value for only $33 a night. I had stayed at the Hilton Hotel for my only other trip to Las Vegas and if given a choice between staying at one hotel or the other for the same price, I would choose Hooters. Marc T. Hardekopf"
285,372,"Jun 20 2007	Hooters this place is a hole	Stayed at Hooters June 15-18,our second night our roof started leaking..we were on the top floor ..floor 19...we had to get transferred to the 3rd floor no comps for this...Manager was a retard would not even give us a free night...got the 3rd floor room and the A/C was busted someone did show up and they fixed it..all in all if you are on a budget its not bad ..otherwise avoid this hole."
286,372,"Jun 12 2007	Just OK	I arrived late Wednesday night and was able to get the room I requested (king, nonsmoking). The room was clean with a view of the pool. I will say the the beds are wonderful but they are put on a metal box to make them higher. I hurt myselft twice because part of the bed frame sticks out. One of the elevators was out for 3 of our 4 days so it made going up and down a long wait. On our 3rd day our A/C went out but it was fixed by the time we returned to the room. Housekeeping was good but we had several lights out that were never replaced and the smoke detector was left on the desk the whole stay. For the price the hotel was fine. We did have issues with the casino because the craps dealers pulled our bets incorrectly twice, so that was frustrating. If you are on a budget this hotel is good but I don't know if I would stay again."
287,372,"Jun 8 2007 	Spot on for the cash	Check in was easy, room comfortable and clean. The staff were generally happy and had more personality than at a lot of the casinos we played. Cant knock the location, short walk to MGM an New York New York. Dont really know why most people moan on here....what do you expect for 50 bucks a night?!?!? As long as you dont mind the smell of greasy chicken wings all the time and dont eat there (food was crap), you cant go wrong"
288,372,"Jun 8 2007 	Not a bad hotel but service wasn't great!	Our stay at the Hooters was fine...........it's a partying place, so definitely very upbeat and loud. But that's to be expected if you're going to this style hotel! The rooms were clean and neat, and we had a view of the pool, which was nice. Location isn't bad, either, just 1 block off the strip. Our only issue, was when we arrived at 11:30 am, and was told we had to wait until 3pm to receive a room key.......no problem. By 5pm, after 2 checks with the clerks, we still did not have a room, and they were just then sending the maid to clean the room (They had told us they were sending the maid 2x already, starting at 3pm when we originally came for the key.) At this point I was frustrated, as we had tickets for a show at 8, and needed to get ready, etc., so I asked our options. They replied, &quot;We don't guarantee check-in time, nor do we guarantee the room you've paid to receive. Just that you'll have &quot;A Room&quot; by the evening.&quot; I have never heard of such a thing! Why on earth does one pay additional for a nicer room, if there's not a chance you'll get it??? I wasted money without knowing it! So, whether it's the response of a grouchy clerk, or their customary policy, I would not recommend based on the service levels. Otherwise, it would be a decent, less expensive option in a pricey city.............."
289,372,"Jun 6 2007 	Could Have Been Better	We stayed here cheap because we were going to one of those timeshare things, so i can't complain about the price. I would have never paid what they were asking for that night $287. This hotel is worth no more than $80-$90 a night. Only stay here if you have a really really good deal. Pros:-Right on the strip across from the MGM, behind Tropicana.-Comfortable beds and pillows-Casino has a laid back feeling-Rooms have new furniture-SafeCons:-Small casino -Small simple pool-Parking lot elevators sounded like they were going to break-Only one hotel elevator was working, the other was out of order.-Elevators were hot with no air conditioning-You can see where parts of the rooms were remodeled, with paint peeling behind wood molding and bathroom floor damaged.-Several large carpet stains in the hallwayI believe this would have been a much nicer hotel if they just would have knocked down the old hotel and built a new one. It just seemed like the cheap way to make a hotel."
290,372,"Jun 6 2007 	Never again!!!	I looked over other reviews and my experience was very similar to another one posted here. We reserved a king size bed far in advance and when we arrived to the hotel we did not learn of the two twin beds until we walked into the room. Dealing with the front desk and management become a common theme on this trip because they made no effort to make the stay enjoyable. We actually received better customer service walking through other hotels on the strip and we were not even staying there. When I asked about the bed set up in our room I was also told they do not guarantee bed preference, only the room it self and that no hotel on the strip guaranteed it. So I called around to test this statement and my first two calls proved them wrong. If it were not for the convention in town and every other hotel booked we would have cancelled our reservations and moved to another hotel. Hooters hotel is also less then spectacular, the paint was peeling of the ceiling, the rooms were very small, and all of the little things you would come to expect from a hotel on the strip were no where to be found. Its as if they expect to thrive on name alone. If it came down to staying there again or canceling the trip I would cancel and look for another vacation spot. Pretty frustrating after coming home from serving my country in the middle east, expecting a relaxing vacation and having what should have been a wonderful time ruined by the horrible customer service of the hotel you are staying at. Never again will I return to this hotel and I tell everyone I know to avoid it, you should do the same."
291,372,"Jun 4 2007 	Hooters - Just OK...	Hooters has hit the strip. However several improvements need to happen soon.Casino - Small but unique. I really liked the music going and the atmosphere. However game limits were high and most of the people staying there are on a budget. The budget players would walk to Tropicana to play.... I'm not sure why they have the poker room but mostly play on 2 tables outside the poker room... You come in from the parking garage right next to these tables. Very distracting.... Always people trying to get through.. etc....Room - Well.... I thought the room was ok... We had a view of the pool and airport. However the window was so dirty that if you wanted any pictures you had to slide it open and stick you arm out the window. We called 3 times to get the window clean but management never called back... They just DO NOT CARE... Parking - Well that is quick and easy but the elevators.. Honestly they sounded like they were literally coming apart. A must fix. Parking is abundant. A bit hard to get through the garage as they are tight corners.. Same way up is the same way down.. Watch out for the other guy..... I was expecting a cleaner place since it was recently redone. But that is far from True. A quick paint job, new beds and coverings and that is it... They even still used the same ole door hinges from the San Remo that have years worth of paint splatter on them.. Only good thing going is the hooter girls... Poker room is a joke.. Management is very weak there too...I will say I thought the RIBS at Marino's were good. All you can eat for $17... Nice waiter.. Good food..."
292,372,"Jun 2 2007 	Extremely poor customer service	The reservations that we booked for our stay requested a king size bed. When we arrived we checked in with no problems, went up to our room and found 2 double size beds. My first agitation with them is they said nothing about this at the front desk. When we called to have the problem fixed they were less than helpful, and all they could say is that they only guarantee the smoking preference of the room and not the bed request. The attitudes of the staff was extremely rude and irritating because it was clear they could care less. We were told to call back the next morning for assistance in switching to a new room. The next morning we called and were told it was first come first served. I considered us first since we were there the day before requesting a king size room. They wouldn't even assist us, and kept saying they didn't guarantee the room and started to say they wouldn't even guarantee the smoking preference. Even the manager treated us rudely and wouldn't do a thing to satisfy the situation. I will never stay there again, and have told everyone I know it wasn't worth it."
293,372,"May 28 2007	NOT NEAR ENOUGH HOOTER GIRLS	Stayed in the suite top floor. Room was OK, Staff was mostly friendly. Drink service at the pool was non existent. Location was good not near enough staff for the volume of people."
294,372,"May 6 2007 	service below expectations	Let me preface this by saying that this is not a reflection of the above average service at the Hooters restaurant that is located in the Hotel. We booked a non-smoking room with a king-sized bed. Upon check-in, the clerks behind the desk told us that they were completely booked solid, and only had smoking room with 2 beds. I asked for our money back, and were told that this was not possible. Several minutes of arguing later, a non-smoking room with a kingsized bed &quot;suddenly&quot; became available.We thought that this might have been an isolated event, but according to several other guests we spoke with, they were greated with an equally difficult time. 3 men who had booked a room with 2 beds were told that only a room with a kingsized bed was available until they argued a bit with the staff.Coming back from the pool in our towels and bathingsuits, our room key did not work, and even with ID the housekeeping staff refused to let us into the room, and one of us had to walk through the whole lobby and casino area, dripping wet in a towel to fix our key.Besides these complaints, the hotel was very clean, the beds were very comfy, and the casino, restaurants and pool fostered a fun and exciting atmosphere. Not too far off the strip, and I would consider staying here again if I could get a good deal."
295,372,"May 1 2007 	Awesome Time	date: 05-01-07From WisconsinI recently stayed at the Hooter's Hotel &amp; Casino in April of 07. I was very surprised at how clean the casino area was. Check in went very smooth and fast. We did have trouble finding the elevators, but a friendly staff member named Michael showed us the way. The room was nice and clean, only problem was the noise coming from the pool area. Had excellent food and service at Dan Marnio's.. We also won some money at the Casino!!! The price was right I will be staying here again."
296,372,"Apr 30 2007 	A hotel that doesn't take itself too seriously	Stayed at Hooters LV for 2 nights during early October 06.Firstly lets get a couple of ground rules set. If you wish to stay in a mega resort with an abundance of shops, attractions and restaurants, then don't waste your time and money by coming here. However if you wish to stay in a good quality mid range hotel where you can get typical Hooters style food (ie wings, burgers and beer) whilst kicking back by a beach style pool area, then Hooters is definately for you. Located on the site of the old San Remo, next to the Tropicana just off the South end of the strip and across the road from the MGM Grand's hotel entrance, Hooters was hosting families, elderly couples and a large array of single women (as well as the ubiquitous single men) when we stayed there. It possesses the &quot;Dan Marino Steakhouse&quot; which targets those who want a higher end feed as well as a generous buffet and snacks at the bar. A convenience store/souvenir shop is located at one end of the casino floor and another souvenir shop is located at the other end of the casino floor as well. Check in was quick and efficient and friendly.The rooms are what you'd expect from a mid range hotel Vegas hotel. Neat, tidy two double beds and a more than adequate bathroom. Our room overlooked the pool area which was a good location. We had no problems with noise either in the hallways or from outside. A very well appointed gymnasium is located off the pool and was cheap by Vegas standards at only $10USD per day. Overall I was more than happy with my stay at Hooters. One word of warning though. If you can't stand the sight of wood panelling then run a mile. You'll understand what I mean when you stay there!!"
297,372,"Apr 30 2007 	Loved Hooters	My husband and I stayed at Hooters Easter week to renew our wedding vowels, we could not have been happier!! Check in was a breeze, the girl at the counter offered us several rooms to choose from, we took one on the 9th floor with a great view of the pool and the airport. We could lay in bed and watch the planes go up. We had NO noise problems at all. The room was very clean and welcoming. The bathroom sparkled with plush, thick towels. Housekeeping was on the ball, we would put the do not desturb sign up until we left for the day, flipped it over indicating the room was ready to be cleaned and it was when we returned. I can't say enough about the casino, we loved it!! It was small enough that we didn't get lost, but big enough to have a great time and win enough to continue playing. We have stayed in other places on the strip in the past, but we will only stay at Hooters in the future. Don't worry about the &quot;Hooters&quot; girls, they are as nice as can be and very professional, most are just college girls trying to earn money. We actually passed up drinks while we were gambling. The location is great, you are only 2 blocks from the strip, there are sidewalks and walk signals.All in all we had a GREAT time and will be going back in the future. DON&quot;T LET THE POOR REVIEW SCARE YOU OFF, IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO STAY."
298,372,"Apr 30 2007 	Terrible Service	Terrible service. Would not honour non-smoking even though our email confrimation stated it. Manager was inflexible and rude. Rooms were below average. No bedspread and they did not give us one during the entir 2 days stay. Room windows were filthy and whne opened a deep fry smell filled the room. Casino is dingy and girls are average. Would not return. Advice, spend the extra $50 per night and go elsewhere."
299,372,Apr 29 2007	Great Stay	A group of 6 people from work who happen to be all men stayed at the Hooters Las Vegas because it was a great deal. I admit being the one who booked the trip that I was a bit nervous booking rooms at Hooters Hotel. The stay turned out to be much above expectation. The rooms were all new and very clean. They were all well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. Now I don't know if my wife could get over all the Hooters girls in the casino and lobby however for a group of guys this place was fantastic. I would have no problem staying at this property again and would rate it as a 4star for the great price we payed of only 50$ a night and the quality of the premises.
300,372,"Apr 22 2007 	Fun 'Redneck' Weekend	We booked our stay at Hooters because we had previously visited the casino and it looked like a fun place to stay. The offer of two tickets to the Nascar race also helped in our decision. We already had tkts to Brooks &amp; Dunn's show so we took the chance. Despite some iffy reviews, we had a great time. The beds were great-wanted to bring mine home. Pool area was nice. Staff was friendly. We had a late check in and had no problem. We would definitely stay there again. If you are looking for a smaller friendly place to stay in Vegas, give it a try. We did."
301,372,"Apr 12 2007 	Hooters was great!	We had a great stay at Hooters. The room was neat, clean and the bed was very, very comfortable. We had a nice view of that end of the strip. Room service was prompt, courtious and the food was excellent! The hamburgers we had at Pete and Shorty's were awesome.The staff seems very happy and the service is excellent. We will definately stay there again."
302,372,"Apr 11 2007 	Fun place no problems at all.	I was leery about booking Hooters and was close to booking Imperial Palace or The Tropicana (we were on a budget) instead but ended up being really glad we went with Hooters (especially after seeing Imperial Palace, eek!). We had no problems whatsoever at Hooters, we booked a guaranteed bungalow room through the website but were upgraded to a tower room on arrival, I'd been hoping that would happen! The room was fine, very clean, the bed comfortable, the bathroom was good, cute basic toiletries etc. No issues with noise, no issues with anything actually. We ate at The Dam the first night, had a good pizza and some drinks, we liked it and prices were really reasonable. Played the slots and a little on the tables, it was more of a place where we'd play for a little while on our way out and back in than where we'd hang out for hours. It had a fun and homely feel though and it was a nice place to come back to at the end of a long day and night out. We found the location to be really good for us, especially for hanging out at New York New York, MGM, Aladdin Dessert Passage shopping centre, the Bellagio etc. If you want to be near Wynns, TI's or The Venetian, Hooters is up the wrong end for you and you'd be better off staying closer to the middle of the strip. Don't worry about being just off the strip if you stay here - some of the hotels are so huge (ie. MGM) your room could literally be as far back off the strip as Hooters is situated. It took about 4 or 5 minutes to walk onto the strip so it didn't worry us at all. Overall, if you're not on a Bellagio budget, Hooters is a decent choice."
303,372,"Apr 3 2007 	Great value for the money!	This hotel was remodeled recently, and the update was great. The surfboard and palm tree theme was fun! I called early in the day to tell the hotel we would be arriving very late, but would still need a non-smoking room due to my son's asthma. The front desk staff who took the call was extremely helpful- asked what we would like a view of, and reserved a room so it would not be an issue when we arrived late. He added that he would put us in for a late checkout since we were arriving after midnight- extra points! When we got there, we were starving, so we ordered room service at 1am, having low expectations. The prices were standard room service rates, but I was astounded that the fruit plate included yogurt, a big muffin, granola, and a HUGE plate of wonderful fresh fruit. It was large enough for all of us to have a good helping of everything. The bathroom was very nice, very clean, and the towels were better than the towels at any big-bucks hotel! The pool area looked great- though we didn't have time to enjoy. This hotel was a great value!"
304,372,"Mar 28 2007 	Great value and service for the money	My husband and I recently stayed here and we were a bit skeptical at first, but had a great time. Here's some positives and negatives about our trip.Positives:Great price-look to the Hooters website for the best ratesFriendly service-Not everyone is runnning around in Hooters uniforms-but everyone down to the chambermaid said hello to us on a daily basisSmall enough not to get lost in-if you've ever stayed at some of the larger hotels on the strip you know what I mean! The lobby was very easy to navigate with a fast check in serviceSmall but engaging gambling floor-lots of slots that pay and lots of tables that were always busy-including a hooters girl pit for those who just can't get enough!!Great restaurants Hooters was above average compared to our local Hooters and-Make sure you try the nachos at The Dam restaurant-HOLY COW-big enough for 3-4 people who are really hungry-and they're good too!!! We had to have them twice while we were thereSuper comfortable beds! Clean rooms and great views from the ocean view towerHooters rewards club-Make sure you join it's free -swipe your card on a daily absis to try for a million, but if you don't win, you still get free points towards cash back as well as free hooters stuff like t-shirts, shot glasses, etc! We did our cheesy gifts form Vegas shopping this way!Negatives: Room was a little low budget for Vegas-but still nice-just not a lot of glamSmell of smoke occasionally in the morning in our room---not sure why???Overpriced Hooters stuff-but it's all overpriced in Vegas!Pool could use some more landscaping, but it's still a super fun place, with an actual waterfall coming down. Very fun amotsphere, conviently located to food and drink access.Overall we had a great low budget vacation in Vagas, and Hooters was the highlight! We just wish we had stayed at Hooters the whole time instead of switching to Hard Rock-we actually came back to gamble and eat at Hooters while we stayed at the Hard Rock-be sure to read my other review on that!"
305,372,"Mar 27 2007 	Above expectations	The hotel is older but you can tell that they have kept it up. The room was great! We booked the bungalow with two queens. The room was large and the decor was perfect. The room even had a bar table with orange top chairs just like in the Hooter's Restaurant. The bathroom even included a sewing kit and Q-tips. How thoughtful! The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet. Oh, and did I mention that they are located less than a block from the strip? The casino was smoky, and the elevators are old and slow. Free internet in the rooms, but no business center."
306,372,"Mar 25 2007 	Not bad for the price	We stayed there for my husband's 30th birthday...his choice. I was leery at first because I had seen photos from when they first opened. Obviously they have remodeled since then. I was impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of the room. We were there for 3 nights and enjoyed it. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. We had a discrepancy with our bill, but a phone call to the accounting department had that solved within an hour. The casino is small compared to the super casinos on the strip, but all the games are there. My only complaint would be the poor ventilation within the casino. The smoke was heavy and almost unbearable for a non-smoker on the weekend. Overall, I was impressed with the quality and am happy we chose this hotel for the price instead of a more expensive hotel with rooms that are just as decent."
307,372,"Mar 17 2007 	Hooters Rocks	What can I say. Hooters is FANTASTIC! The casino is small and felt personal. The cocktail waitresses were polite and prompt (and easy on the eye) but the Hooter girl dealers were distracting.Rooms, fantastic. Heaps of room and had everything you need. I do not know what previous reviewers were on about as I had no issues with noise from neighbours. The pool area was good and the fire pit burning of a night meant I could sit outside and socialise over a beer or 3!Restaurants: Hooters was always busy but had no trouble getting a spot at the Dam Restaurant. Try the Nachos. $8.95 and between 3 of us we could not finish them. HUGE. Will stay at Hooters again, no problems there!"
308,372,"Mar 16 2007 	Loved Hooters	I have just returned after staying a week at hooters hotel in las vegas. This was my first trip to the area and wasnt sure what to expect. After reading the reviews i was very nervous, but got a great deal so took a chance. And I am very glad i did. The room was nice size and comfortable. The bed was amazing. We only had very nice and quick service. Upon getting to my room our safe was not working, i called the front desk and they had it fixed within 5 mins. We had no trouble with having hot water, but we never got up before noon. The casino is smaller compared to the others on the strip, but you dont have to wait for your comp. drinks like you do at the bigger ones. I would stay here again, it has a nice relaxed feeling to it. Travel tip: See the shark reef, ride the monorail or take the public buss or bye some really comfortable shoes youll be doing alot of walking."
309,372,"Mar 14 2007 	Good value	Stayed two nights, very busy week in Las Vegas and prices for last minute stays were OUTRAGEOUS at nearly every other resort, so I figured for 50 bucks a night, how can you go wrong? Check in was efficient and I was in my room in no time. Overall the room was clean.. there were a couple of issues (stepped on a pretzel!) but nothing terribly serious. Bed was fabulous! Great quality mattress. Roomy bathroom with nicer than average toiletries and good water pressure. Towels were nicer than average for a hotel in this price range. Pretty cool heated pool area, very nice lounge chairsMy friends all teased me for staying at Hooters, (the rest of my group were at MGM) but I would stay here again, for a budget hotel it was very nice."
310,372,"Mar 7 2007	Great time at Hooters	Everything was excellent My husband and i went with his hockey team and some players wifes...Really the only problem was the distance from everything on the strip....it was a ways a way from everything and the pool closed WAY to early..we went with a hockey team and we all wanted to go swimming one night and it wasn't open which really sucked. Everyone was very friendly and food was good,The beds were very comfortable and the water nice and hot for showers,,it also has a firepit out by the pools which was really nice.All in all it was a very good stay and i'd stay again at hooters"
311,372,"Mar 7 2007 	I have seen better	I stayed at Hooters with a group of girls at the end of February. The casino and rooms look exactly like the restaurant..nothing spectacular. It was cheap which was great but you really get what you paid for. The rooms were really cheesy looking but I didn't stay there for the decor. Our toilet overflowed and they only wiped it down with towels. My biggest complaint is how much the entire Casino smelled like cigarette smoke. It was a relief to walk out of there and go to the other nice smelling casinos on the strip. There isn't any place worth going to in the casino and the food at The Dam wasn't very good. How do you mess up a milkshake? I think this Hotel is good for a group of guys, gamblers and cigarette smokers. If you don't want to spend a lot of money and you don't mind smelling like an ashtray then this is a good place to stay."
312,372,"Mar 1 2007	enjoyed my one nite here...	booked here last minute because jetblue canceled our flight.. got a room for 59bucks, but when i got to the hotel, they put us in a tower room...awesome! everything was clean, didn't smell of smoke.. was very happy with the room for what we paid.. plus it's quick walk to see some hotties dealing cards downstairs.. this place is full of guys though..so u wont see many female customers... great job hooters! for providing a laid back hotel for a great price! i would stay here again... check out time here is noon! compared to 10am or 11am at other hotels on the strip"
313,372,"Feb 27 2007 	A work in progress	My wife &amp; I stayed at this property for one night in early Feb. We were in town to see a concert at the MGM. We choose this property because of the close proximity to the MGM and the price. It's an older property in need of updating, but you can see where they are trying. The rooms were nicely decorated. The beds were super comfy and the bathroom was good sized. However, our room was in need of a new door and new sliding patio door (ours were old and rickety). The wall are thin, so you do hear a lot of noise. Being that it is a smaller/older property, the corridors are narrow, which probably contributes to the noise factor.The front desk staff was indifferent upon arrival and checkout (they were neither welcoming nor rude). We had one meal at the cafe. The waiter was nice and the food was good, but a bit pricey. Overall, for a night's stay it was fine, but we wouldn't consider a longer stay."
314,372,"Feb 24 2007	Not a bad place at all for the price	We stayed a night here the first part of Feb. I was highly skeptical, especially since it was 2 females. I was extremely impressed! The decor is cool, sort of beachy, surfboards, etc. The room is a really good size, with plenty of counter and desk space. It was clean. I have stayed in many of the enormous hotels in Vegas but what I liked about Hooters was the fact that it was relatively small, not a lot of walking from check in to our room, and not a lot of walking from the elevator to the rooms either. The windows in the room opened up too, which was nice for fresh air, but really not very safe, as they were low and a person could easly step right out!! It was not pool weather but the pool did look pretty small, however we didn't walk around it to know more about it."
315,372,"Feb 16 2007	Ah.....the smell of wings in the morning	It was our 1st time in Vegas, and we had a blast. We stayed at Hooter's for the obvious reason, cheap. We were under the impression that it was a brand new hotel. We thought, well you can't go wrong with new. This hotel is not new. It is old and barley refurbished. There were alot of great things about Hooters.1) $10 tables which are hard to find elsewhere2)Comfy beds3)Resonable drink prices4)Lots of cocktails while gambling bacause casino is small5)Close to MGM/NYNY6)Hotwings are good when you are drunk7)Chicken Squak on the phoneWith the price come quite a few of those &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; negatives.1)The shower was hot &amp; cold the whole time I showered. This sucks when you are hungover and want a long warm shower2)The carpets are stained and gross3)The elevators are stinky, small, and tempermental4)You can't get away from the smell of wings and cigarettes5)It is quite a walk to most of the strip &amp; cabs get expensiveOverall, I enjoyed the experience. I will probably stay at one of the larger hotel/casinos next time."
316,372,"Feb 16 2007 	Really enjoyed ourselves	We vist Las vegas every year on our way to family and also stop there on the way back, We have tried other hotels but so far Hooters has been the one we return to and have told others its so central for what ever you need to get around L.V.The strip is only a walk away also getting the metro link plus the bus stop is right outside what more can you ask. No i am not a 21+ but a 50+ and i really enjoy staying here most people have been helpful and the rooms were clean and plesant as well."
317,372,Feb 14 2007 	Had a Blast!!!	Had a one night stay at Hooters this past week and had a ball. Stayed there once before during the transformation from the old Sam Remo. All I can say is wow!!! The rooms are very nice and the Beds are as comfortable as they come. The Dam resturaunt breakfast was outstanding and the portions are huge. Hooters resturaunt was a great meal as well. The renovation of the pool area came out great. Gambling was good and the cocktail waitresses brought em as quick as you could put them down. Wish I had been able to stay a few more nights but it is what it is. I'll definately be back at a later date.Fast pace Fun!!!!Massachusetts Mike
318,372,"Feb 14 2007	1st Time at Hooters was Four Stars!!! 	Our Trip was Fri December 22 - Sunday Dec 24. This was a superise trip for my husband as I told him at the airport we were going to Vegas. Was nervous after reading some reviews and after visiting hooters to gamble twice before the place just did not impress me. My husband was delighted to find we were staying at Hooters as any husband would. We rented a car and parked in the Parking Garage reluctlantly. There are some cameras in the garage try to park your car in a view of the camera that is what we did and never had a problem. There is no Valet here and the only other option is to park in the lot in between here and tropicana. Okay Beware of the Parking Garage Elevators one of them creaks and makes the most horrid noises it sounds as thought the box you are in is just going to pop. However we never got stuck and instead had a few laughs about it. Check in was a Breeze, the girl was friendly enough and I told her we were celebrating a special occasion and asked if there were any upgrades? She went and talked to her manager and offered me a Presidential Suite for $50 per night Upgrade or a International Suite for Free, We took the freebee. What a great room. We were in the Bayview tower which I think is the most accessable tower. Room 901 it was literrally right next door to the elevator which was a hoot, but seriously we never heard the elevator once or noise in the hallways which are very cute with surfboards and other cute decor. We entered the room to a huge entry way with a full bathroom, then a Bar with sink and fridge, palm trees Orange and Brown Decor, A huge plazma flat screen tv, little table to have cocktails at, a full size couch L shaped, the Bedroom was seperate and was very tropical themed I thought very cute. there was another TV, Desk, closet, and another Full Bathroom. We paid $50 a night what a deal. We went downstairs and sat at the 13 martini bar and enjoyed the live band that played yor requests, they rocked and we had a great time. We ate at the Damn Restrant a couple of times and the service was excellent and the food was too at a great price. Cute Diner.. Also ate at Pete and shortys, had some wings and slider burgers they were good too. The people at the club orange werevery friendly and helpful. Sportbook guy was nice too. Cocktail service is Non existant here I once ordered a drink and never saw her again. We hung out by the pool at night they had nice fires in pits that you could sit or stand around. Really enjoyed how easy the property was to get around. Yes it is small but we enjoyed that. Spent a lot money in the Bait Shoppe on goodies to bring home and was diappointed I didnt get a chance to try the hidden sushi bar in the back. We enjoyed our stay and safely walked from Hooters into the tropicana where we won some $ fast. also walked the four corners, went to Coyote Ugly was kinda fun, checked out the ceterfuge bar at MGM. All in all it was a great time. We are heading back to Hooters in March and I am hoping the second time will be as awesome as the first. If it is we are going back in May and July and we will stay here again. Check out all my pictures of the room and view, etc. Enjoy Cheers friends"
319,372,"Feb 9 2007 	We'll go back to Hooters!	My husband and I (40-ish) stayed at Hooters January 27-30. This was our first trip to Las Vegas; we are planning to return and will stay at Hooters again.We arrived just before noon and got right into a room. The young lady at the front desk was very efficient and friendly. We requested to switch rooms because the sliding door would not lock and within 20-30 minutes we were in another room. The room was clean and comfortable; very Hootersesque with orange lampshades and bar stools and table. The bed may be the most comfortable we've ever slept on.We enjoyed breakfast 2 mornings at the Dam Restaurant and highly recommend this restaurant. We ate 3 times at Pete &amp; Shorties (the sports betting bar), which had a basic bar menu with appetizers, sandwiches and salads; we particularly liked the mini-burgers and side salad. We had dinner one evening at the Hooters restaurant (your basic Hooters) and one evening at the Back Portch which is on the back side of Hooters and has the same menu. We spent most of our evenings at the Lobby Bar.The atmosphere in the casino and the entire hotel is very casual, fun and laid back; we LOVED it. The casino is much smaller than the others we saw on the strip.The only negative was on the last evening at the Lobby Bar when we were told our drinks would not be comped unless we had a minimum of $10 in the machine and playing max bets (new rules all of a sudden?). We left and went to Pete &amp; Shorties where we were told the same thing; again, we had been here 3 days and had not heard this. Other than these 2, all servers were very friendly and efficient.If you enjoy your local Hooters restaurant and the atmosphere, you will like the Hooters Casino Hotel in Vegas."
320,372,"Feb 5 2007 	Low down at the Ho down!!!!!	My boyfriend and I (in our early 30's) stayed at Hooter's Casino and Hotel on Sat., Feb. 3, 07 to celebrate his birthday. We frequent the Vegas strip and stayed at the Mandalay, Imperial Palace, Rio, Bally's,Harrah's, Paris, Bellagio....to name a few,but since we were only there for 1 (one) night and this was the Superbowl weekend, the prices of any hotels on the strip were astrinomical. Out of all the cheaper hotels we could have stayed at, my reason for choosing Hooter's was that it's new and the location -(I knew their grand opening was just about a year ago and that it was very near the South Strip (next to Tropicana and accross from MGM)). Booked reservation through tripres.com for about ($126) and was quoted a &quot;Bungalow&quot; style room. We ended up on the 2nd floor on the Bay View tower next to the elevator. (I asked why I was given a regular tower room and front desk said I need to pay $30 to reserve your request). Check in(arrived at 2p.m.) was quick and easy and rooms were ready and clean and a little bigger than what was pictured on the website. Cosmetic wise, the room was comfortable,new, and inviting (furniture, sheets, bedding-comfy!!!,towels,etc.-all new and plush) The building structure needs repair- shower needs temp. control-streams of hot water would jet out while showering,walls are a bit thin, you could hear the neigbors opening closet doors and murmuring but we were surprised we didn't hear the elevators); and the elevators-very tempermental, so please know your fire escape. Staff wise, everyone was average, they don't go out of the way to please you but just there to do their job and to answer questions. They might need to staff more cocktail waitresses cause it was very rare to have a comp. drink while playing the slots. If you ladies are worried about the taboo, only the cocktail waitresses are dressed the same as the girls at your local hooter's not the dealer's, the front desk, the Dam restauant workers etc. - there's no girls gone wild here!!!! Other than the 4a.m. fire/emergency drill and a short direct t.v. cable outtage at 3a.m., all was great! I would go back to the Hooter's hotel if the only purpose was just to rest (your in a city where there is something to do 24/7!!!). It's better than the IP, Harrah's, the downtown Vegas hotels or any other OLDER hotels on the strip. But if you are looking for the Las Vegas experience, pay more and stay at the bigger hotels with more amenities. Other tips from other ta's: get the club orange card for store discounts (20% off), the Dam restaurant is like a old-school Diner and prices are reasonable - had the prime rib for $6.95 and the burger - big- w/ seasoned fries for $10-24/7. Casino has $10 blackjack and $5 war. Walk next to the Tropicana for $5 blackjack and go to the MGM for Sports Booking. Location is great-just bring comfortable shoes. Only when we stayed at Hooter's, we noticed a tram at the MGM, don't know where it goes but we'll find out the next time we stay there! Have fun."
321,372,"Feb 3 2007 	Decent Place	Stayed here for a night in December and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms have a pseudo tropical feel - much different and nicer than I expected.The mattress was comfortable and had decent bedding, including full length body pillows. However, I should note that the beds are pretty high off the floor. People with mobility problems may have some difficulty getting in and out of bed. No problems with the bathroom - everything was clean and functioned properly.The sports book is a Leroy's so it's tiny and doesn't have drink service. You can sit at the VP bar and watch the games on the plasma TVs but you either have to milk the VP for free drinks or just pay. On the plus side, their parlay payouts are the best you'll find in LV and you can cash tickets under $1200 (think this is the max.) at any of the other locations.The casino is pretty small but the employees were friendly and the drink service was very good.Overall, they have done a good job refurbishing this property. Just don't expect the wow factor."
322,372,"Jan 29 2007	First Time in Vegas	My stay at Hooters was part of my first visit to Vegas. I along with three other friends were on a three week road trip and Vegas was one of our last major stops so price was a major factor in our decision. We got a deal through Expedia where we ended up paying only $88 total for three nights. This unbelieveable deal gave us a little pause on the type of hotel and room we would find when we arrived in Vegas, but to our delight our room was clean, spacious and defintely worth every penny. The location was great too... It was directly across the street from the Monorail and steps away from Excalibur, the Tropicana, the MGM and New York New York to name a few major hotels. One complaint we had though was with internet. Although we knew they didn't offer a wireless option our friends did purchase ethernet service and were unable to use it. However, the hotel promptly refunded their money...but it definately was an irritant. Also, although the valets and housekeeping staff were excellent, the front desk upon check in was really sketchy! In fact, I thought it was funny that the individual checking us in &quot;Robert&quot; not only gave us the worst attitude but was also designated the trainer on his name tag. My professional work includes training and development and I think that with leaders in the work environment that treat customers in such an inappropriate way is definately not good business and should make this establishment think about who they place in those roles in the future!"
323,372,"Jan 24 2007 	Good value but beware if you park there	A college friend and I met in Vegas for a bachelor party and we decided we needed a relatively-inexpensive option since we would only use the room to sleep. We shared a room at Hooter's with two double beds. This hotel allowed Saturday night check-in, which is rare in Vegas, and the price ($170) was cheap in comparison to some of the bigger hotels on the strip. It was only a short cab ride to where we needed to be on the strip anyways.Check-in was smooth and easy and there were no mix-ups with my pre-paid reservation. The room was clean and nice. Nothing spectacular, but adequate in every way for a shower and a bed to sleep on. The casino is small but busy and patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves. There is a small sports bar, an old-school diner, a regular Hooter's restaurant, and Dan marino's (finer dining) on site. We opted for the Hooter's restaurant for lunch and the service was quick and friendly. The waitresses all wear the standard t-shirt and orange shorts (both regular and cocktail waitresses on the casino floor). The only real negatives were one minor and one major complaint. The minor complaint is that the average patron was a little bit on the lower-class side. This is to be expected at one of the chaper hotels near the strip. If they were high-rollers that could afoord $800/night at Bellagio, they wouldn't be at Hooter's. This was of no consequence to us, but for those of you who feel uneasy around lower socio-economic people you might consider spending more money elsewhere. We were stared down by two imposing ex-con looking guys near the diner (for no apparent reason) but we just laughed it off.The major complaint is that my friend's truck that was parked overnight in the Hooter's parking garage was broken into and several items were taken (resulting in a $500 deductible). I would not recommend parking here. Other than that, it is a decent value for the $$. I can highly recommend Tao restaurant (at Venetian) for dinner and Pure nightclub (in Caesar's) for clubbing, if you have the $$. Our group of friends were high-rollers from the East Coast and we were able to enjoy top-notch VIP service at both of these locales."
324,372,"Jan 23 2007 	Excellent hotel	I stayed here for 2 nights in Jan (15th and 16th). I arrived at 16.00 and was given a twin Ocean View room. The room was very nice, it actually seemed quite new. I was staying on the 17th floor and I had a view of McCarran Airport, which was quite cool. The floor I was on was very quiet and I didn't hear my neighbours at all during my stay. I recieved a $20 voucher for Dan Marinos on arrival and I ate here one of the nights. The food was very good and the service was very good.The overall atmosphere of the hotel is very casual, which suits me fine as I don't really like the formality of most of the other hotels.I would defintely stay here again, just make sure that you avoid the bungalow rooms"
325,372,"Jan 21 2007 	sweet suite	After reading the bad reviews about cabanna rooms, I upgraded to a suite. Good move, because we had the &quot;presidential suite&quot; for the entire stay, for the price of the &quot;regular suite&quot;, (Hooters overbooked the reg. suites). The suite was large. 1 full bath, 2 half baths, pool table, bar with mini fridge and coffee maker. Living room with 42&quot; HD plasma tv and sectional sofa, which can be converted to a bed.  Between the pool table and living area is a dining table for six. The master bedroom had another TV (not HD or flat screen), and a jacuzzi tub, with an ajoining marble bath with a shower and double bowl sink. Hooters overall is a LITTLE casino. Not many choices in table games, only 3 craps tables, only 1 of which was running during our stay. Slots are from penny up to a dollar or more. Drink service is hit or miss, mostly miss. Table players get better service than slot players, unless Alana is working the slot area. A BIG TY to Alana for awesome service while playing penny slots. The pool area is small in comparison to other nearby hotels, but is heated, and has 2 separate hot tubs. I did see people in both the pool and hot tub, even though the outside temp. was below freezing at night and only in the 30's to 40's during the day. We only ate at the Dam and had room service, both are equal to a Denny's or Cracker Barrel. I would stay here again. Clean rooms, easy walk to other casinos, great price."
326,372,"Jan 16 2007 	Don't give a hoot for Hooter's	I arrived on Saturday morning and was allowed to check-in right away. The room seemed okay at first, but my opinion changed when it was time to go to bed. This property caters to a 20 something crowd, and with the low room rates, that's what it attracts. At 4:30 am, both nights of my stay, I was awakened by loud, partying neighbors. The walls are thin and noise from everywhere including the street comes right in. The heating unit was loud, but fortunately it drowned out some of the noise from the room next door. The casino is small and cramped. The blackjack tables are all single deck 6:5 games, or tables with side bets. Not a place for serious players. The sports book is tiny and along the back wall of a restaurant. The Hooter's girls were attractive, but most cocktail waitresses in Vegas casino's are attractive. I dined in Marino's, The Dam, and ordered room service. The food quality and service was quite well for each. I also needed a fresh towel brought to my room, and housekeeping brought it in a matter of minutes. All of the staff I dealt with were very polite and customer oriented. Personally, I won't stay at Hooter's again. The concept is good and I feel if they had built a hotel/casino from the ground up (rather than renovating a property that should have seen the wrecking ball years ago), it would have made for a better experience."
327,372,"Jan 8 2007 	Friendly fresh and convienent	As a 33 year diehard feminist, whose work a lot of time involves working with women victims of violence, there have been a lot of times that I have to explain my deep love for Hooters restaurants. (My fiance took me to a Hooters for a nightcap on our first date!) Imagine how my love was heightened when they have added a casino to their line of restaurants! When I saw they were opening a casino @ the old San Remo in Las Vegas I couldn't wait until it opened. A business trip right before New Year's weekend took my fiance &amp; myself there for 2 nights. It was fun, clean &amp; a very pleasant surprise. Their uniforms in comparison to the other casino's waitress is pretty tame. Also, the girls and guys on staff were all very friendly. Across from the enormous MGM this place was refreshingly intimate but big enough to serve our needs. I had been to the San Remo twice before, it used to have a great steakhouse, and in its ending days it was clear the place needed to be redone. Keeping the orginal setup for Hooters- the palm trees, white on orange decor is cool, bright &amp; hip.The Dam Diner was a good value with good food &amp; friendly service. The Hooters was a run of the mill place but nice. The nicer Dan Marino's was empty but nice--- elegant, dark &amp; sleek. The martini bar with the TKO house band performing cover songs was nice too. The waitress was attentive and the drinks generous. The band is nice &amp; willing to play whatever the audience wanted to keep the dance floor packed. It was fun. The rooms were just redone... not much, just update furnishings &amp; painting but nice nonetheless. I loved having the Hooters bar table &amp; stools in my room.... it made our nights festive for a drink of our own! Even the fake palm tree in the room with its kitcshy-ness made for a nice visit. I highly endorse this property--- I will definitely be back!"
328,372,"Jan 3 2007	Better than expected	It was going to be New Year's weekend and I had a daughter turning 21 on December 30th. I needed something within walking distance of the strip at a reasonable price because I needed three rooms. It was actually a friend who spotted this bargain on-line after she heard about our plans and decided to join us. Our price was $179.00/night and even at that price I don't think they were full by New Year's eve. Check-in was a breeze and despite one room not being immediately ready, it was 45 minutes later. They put our 21 yr old (and her boyfriend) next to us and my other daughter directly across the hall. Very convenient for our meeting during our three nights there. Rooms were comfortable, linens upgraded, bathrooms only average to less than average. There is no desk. Walls were thin but we never had any real problems with that. We dined in the Dam Restaurant a number of times; for lunch, breakfast and a late night snack. Service there was great, a rarity in Las Vegas. I ate in Hooters on two different occassions, in each instance service was excellent. This despite the second time it being five of us and being during the lunch hour on Sunday, in the middle of NFL football. Lines were 30 people long but we were in within ten minutes The staff was well trained consistent with all of their locations I was told.  But I save my biggest compliments for &quot;13 Martini&quot;, the lounge where my daughter had her first official drink. The waitress, Brittany, took note of the occassion, asked her what she wanted for her first drink and delivered that drink on the house at the witching hour of midnight. In a crowded bar with a rock n' roll band playing in the background she didn't have to pay that much attention. She did, the band acknowledged the event,...it was all good. In summary, we could have stayed next door at the Tropicana for twice the price, but didn't. We could have searched for good food with good service and more price at the MGM across the street, but wouldnt. We could have been considered just another cow following the herd but Hooters couldn't. They cut us from the pack on a couple of occasions and made us feel special. I will be back in Las Vegas in three weeks for a convention and I will be staying at Caesars. It will be nice and I will like it. But I will miss the homey feel of the 600 room Hooters as compared to one of these mega-hotels. Hooters was the perfect location for our Birthday/New Year's trip"
329,372,"Dec 31 2006 	Clean and a great value	The first thing to keep in mind is that the tower rooms are new, while (I think) the bungalow rooms are not. I think this explains the disparities in the reviews. We got there REALLY early (10:15 am). My husband went to ask if they could call us on our cell when our room was ready, and when I got to the desk, we were checked in already with no extra charge. I've never had that happen anywhere else. It probably isn't common here, either, but it made our day! We got in a tower room and it was the cleanest hotel room I've been in in a while. We had a non-smoking room that had really never been smoked in, unlike most non-smoking rooms and it was bigger than it looked online. It looked over the pool, not the Strip, but it was only 60 bucks a night over Christmas. The restaurant had a nice little breakfast buffet and ridiculously huge plates of nachos along with friendly service. The casino is nice, with fairly loose slots and better than average cocktail servcie from Hooters girls. Frankly, the Hooters girl uniform is one of the most modest cocktail waitress uniforms on the strip, so don't let the Hooters thing throw you if the restaurant isn't your thing."
330,372,"Dec 28 2006 	Great value enjoyable stay	We stayed at Hooters Nov. 29th - Dec. 2nd with another couple. My husband and I booked a &quot;free&quot; Second Honeymoon package with Condolidated resorts. We had to listen to a 2 hr. timeshare presentation on a new property called &quot;Tahiti Village&quot; and our stay was basically free. Hooters is the hotel they put us up at. We were pleasantly surprised! Our room was clean, and spacious. Definitely not luxurious by any means, but certainly comfortable and we had a great view of the strip. We requested a non-smoking King and got it, although the entire hotel (and all of Las Vegas for that matter) smelled like an ashtray. I guess there's only so much you can do about it when everyone on the casino floor is smoking. The Dam Restaurant had an awesome breakfast buffet with the best bacon we've ever had...you have to try it. They also made a great milkshake. The Hooters restaurant had the typically great wings, but we didn't eat at any of the other restaurants.We really didn't do a lot of gambling, but found the casino at the hotel to be a welcomed respite from all of the other over-the-top, in-your-face casinos that we were in.The fitness center looked really well-equipped, and the pool area was very nice, although with the weather rarely reaching above 40 degrees while we were there, it was closed. They did have fire-pits out there if you felt like sitting out campfire style.All in all, if we ever do go back to Vegas, we would definitely stay at Hooters again."
331,372,"Dec 27 2006 	super 8 full of drunken rednecks	we lucked into the last parking spot in front of the building and walked up to the front desk. After several clerks got done chatting amongst themselves one went out of there way to help us and we were checked in.then, we got to drag our luggage all the way through the casino to the elevators in back.We got into our room and it was about average for hotels in the area, about what one would expect from a holiday inn except the colors were a bit more orange (and there were bar stools instead of chairs).Taking a quick nap being venturing forth into vegas we were woke up my the people next door shooting at each other.coming back that night there were numerous piles of garbage from room service left in the hallway which were still there the next morning. Coming back late the next evening, our room wasn't cleaned. I don't think our room was cleaned once over a 3 day stay.And don't be fooled about it being a &quot;new&quot; hotel, it was an old hotel with the casino remodeled and the rooms look like they got new furniture and maybe carpet."
332,372,"Dec 27 2006 	Comfortable at Hooters	My wife and I stayed at Hooters for 5 nights in December and loved it. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff were very friendly, there is a nice pool and hot tub that were open and they have plenty of places to eat. The breakfast buffet at Dam's restaurant was good. There were even fresh strawberries, raspberries. blueberries and blackberries, which is unusual. Hooters was only a short walk to MGM Grand and Tropicana, Excaliber, etc. The casino is small enough that I could always find my wife and the payback at the slots were just as good as anywhere else.The only negative comment would be they were only offering $10.00 blackjack tables during our stay while other casino's on the strip had $5.00 tables. Also, we were facing the airport which was loud sometimes but at least the windows open and the fan would block out the planes taking off.We would definitely stay at Hooters again."
333,372,"Dec 14 2006 	Great hotel great experience	I am 23yo who travelled with my best friend. Room cost $44 after tax, checkin was early and very easy at 10:30 am and room was very clean with no smell. Got 9th room overlooking the beautiful pool. I saw all of 5 people total at the pool, but it was there and looked great and warm. Booked though hotels.com and recieved a few credits including $20 at Marinos. Ate there and it was decent, nothing to write home about, except the $6 coronas. Bill was still cheap after the credit. Check out the $6.99 prime rib and get fries with it, not very classy but tastes great, although my Mid rare, was mid well, oh well. Strip is a three minute walk. From the airport you can take a shuttle for $5 each, a cab for reportedly $8-$9 or the public bus for $2.5 all day pass, or $1.25 each way. I opted for the public bus which you can pickup on level zero. Take 109 or 108 to the 201 conector, very easy and quick, just about 15 minutes. Check out low limits at Barbary Coast, Slots a fun outside Circus Circus, nearby Tropicana."
334,372,"Dec 12 2006 	Better than expected	Stayed at Hooters Hotel on Sunday night Dec. 10 after staying overnight at Arizona Charlies Decatur (see other review). Paid $39 with credits towards dining at Marinos.I was pleasantly surprised with the location. Walking distance to the &quot;strip&quot; and hotels on the south side (across MGM, next to Tropicana, near New York, New York, Excalibur, etc.) The service was average, but the rooms were definitely better than expected. I stayed in the Ocean View section and the rooms seemed to be upgraded and did not show signs of wear/tear. The casino on the other hand, was small (about 20 craps, blackjack, pai gow tables) and the Poker Room (dubbed Pete's Poker Room) was very cramped with only 4 or 5 tables. I missed the Sunday poker tournament, but I think it would have been fun, for only $27.Didn't get a chance to use the $20 dining coupon, because Dan Marino's restaurant is only open for dinner.Overall, I like the hotel. I've stayed at a worse(r) ones, so this one wasn't too bad. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the budget conscious travelers who want to stay closer to the strip."
335,372,"Dec 11 2006 	Will DEFINITELY return!!!	Both my and my sister's families, kids included, stayed at Hooters over Thanksgiving week. We all loved it!!! It's super close to the airport and right off the Strip behind Tropicana. We were able to take the MGM tram which was directly across from the Hotel or cab it to the far end of the Strip using back roads and avoided the traffic for a few bucks.The Casino is small enough to find the other members of your party without searching for hours but big enough to have some breathing room. The entire staff was very laid back and friendly and the dealers were great... Murphy and Rob kept my sister and I laughing for hours. Lastly, the cocktail waitress' who are all Hooters girls, were quick to come around with drinks and SUPER sweet, especially Toi.The rooms were very clean, comfortable and big, we even had an awesome view of the Strip. The pool was still open and was heated so whole family was able to spend a day outsided swimming and playing... even had wings delivered poolside by a beautiful bikini clad Hooters girl, which our husbands enjoyed!!!As for entertainment, the house band at 13 was AWESOME, played everything from Train to Pat Benetar!! Plus Wednesday nigths ladies drank free for 9-12! The Hooters Restaurant had all the games on so the guys got their football fix. And the Dam Restaurant served great food, the Prime Rib for $7 was the deal!!!All in all it was a great stay and we will definitely stay there our next trip to Vegas!"
336,372,"Dec 11 2006 	Very Dissapointed!	We looked forward to visiting the &quot;new&quot; Hooters Hotel and Casino on our most recent trip. We found our room to smell like an ashtray and the water heating to be sub-standard. As for the casino....YUK! It wasn't at all what we thought it would be! The staff was less than friendly, less than professional, and they sure didn't support a &quot;fun environment&quot;. I think we'll just stay at home next time and go to our local Hooters and play cards! Hooters should be ashamed of this endeavor...it is not representative of their other operations!"
337,372,"Dec 5 2006 	great	I have recently returned from a stay here and I must say what a fantastic experience is was. The check in was smooth and quick although I was a little worried when the young lady at the desk started by saying &quot;sorry about this but we are fully booked, wouldyou mind if I put you in a suite for the first night&quot; phew what a relief, the suite was really nice and plenty of room, with a gigantic plasma screen tv in the living area. The next day when we were moved to a standard room I was again pleased with the room,loads of space and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.The staff here were all very pleasant and everyone had a smile on there face. All in all this is one of the best kept secrets in Vegas, and I will return on my next visit ."
338,372,"Nov 30 2006 	mixed feelings also	My husband and I reserved our room at Las Vegas .com, and we got a really great deal. One of the reasons we wanted to stay there was for the fact that Dan Marino's resteraunt is in side that building. also for the fact that I am afraid of heights and elevators. When we found out they gave us the 14th floor, and we were not aloud to use stairs, we went back to the front desk, and they quickly changed our room to a bungalow second floor out by the pool. It was lovely. The room was great and the service was awesome. The second night we were there however we wanted to get into the hot tub because it was very cold that night. We were told to get out of the hot tub, it was closed, even though it wasnt nearly ten yet.( I thought in Vegas, nothing ever closes). We complained to the front desk about it, and they told us, well, we dont guests to get sick., because it was cold outside. The casino is small and smoky (but they are all smoky, but were from California). Dont eat at The Dam resteraunt for breakfast its awful! Other than that DO go visit Holly in the bar, she was a great person to hang around!"
339,372,"Nov 29 2006 	Enjoyed my stay	I enjoyed my stay at the Hooters Hotel/Casino! As soon as I entered I was smiling and laughing. The decor is just like being at your local Hooters. Only Hooters would have a tin ceiling with a chandelier in a casino!My room was in the 2 story bungalow section. I liked being over there vs being in the main building. Had an excellent view of the pool area, and that is a big plus at Hooters! Bed was so comfortable, and everything was great with the facilities.I especially enjoyed &quot;The DAM Restaurant&quot; for meals. Enjoyed seeing the Alan Kulwicki / Hooters NASCAR championship car in its permanent display."
340,372,"Nov 28 2006 	Great Getaway Weekend	We just got back from The Hooters Hotel was perfect for our group. We are all between the ages of 18-22 and the atmosphere was so relaxing and just fun. We got there at 2 in the morning on Thursday Morning and Left Sunday at Noon. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we all fell in love with it. Well the guys mostly fell in Love with the Hooter's girls. The rooms were VERY nice and oh gosh the beds are perfect!! My boyfriend wants to buy that kind of bed now. The price was great, we booked at the perfect time. We got 2 rooms for 4 nights for $ 400 all together. The swimming pool was perfect, and it had a little like camp fire pits around the pool which was great at night. The pool was heated also. I heard a lot of bad reviews about this hotel but I am glad we went there. Everybody loved it there. Perfect place for those who want to have fun and be close to the action!"
341,372,"Nov 25 2006 	Not impressed with Hooters	My wife and I just returned from a 6-night stay at the Hooters Hotel and Casino. We arrived in a good mood, but left disappointed.We had reserved a non-smoking room with a king size bed. However, during check-in, we were informed that none of these rooms were available. After telling the young man at the registration desk that we had specifically reserved a non-smoking room with a king size bed several weeks ago, he told us that Hooters doesn't accept reservations, only requests for rooms, and none of the rooms that we requested were available. This wouldn't have been that big of a deal if we hadn't traveled across the country and my credit card hadn't already been billed for our 6-night stay.We asked for an upgrade, but were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms with 2 full-size beds, but that we could be moved to the type of room we requested the next day. Since we didn't have any other options, we decided to accept his offer. I asked for a discount for the inconvenience, but was given four free drink coupons instead.Our first room was on the second floor. The view out of our open, unlocked, broken sliding glass door was of some electrical equipment. The bed comforters smelled strongly of smoke, the water took over a minute to get hot, and it tasted moldy.The next day, we had to wait until 2:00 PM for our &quot;expected&quot; room to become available. The water in this room still tasted moldy, but the water didn't take long to heat up since hot water was constantly leaking from the shower. This was more of a feature than a problem for us. This room also overlooked the pool area, which was a bonus, but it didn't change our impression of the hotel. Perhaps if we got this room from the start, we'd be happier with the hotel.The maids were the nicest people in the hotel. The staff at the registration desk were mixed. Some were very nice, some weren't.The Hooters restaurant was good, but no different than any other Hooters restaurant across the country.The casino is small compared to other nearby casinos, but this wasn't a big deal to us, since we don't gamble much.This hotel is a 5-minute walk from the intersection of Tropicana Blvd. and Las Vegas Blvd. If you've never been to Las Vegas before or stayed on The Strip, this probably won't be an issue. However, having stayed at New York New York last year, my wife and I agreed that it would be worth the few extra bucks a night to stay on The Strip in a newer hotel than save money by staying off the strip in this refurbished hotel."
