262,2131,"Dec 24 2007 	A great choice whether you're there for business or for romance	It may sound a bit strange, but I think it's true. Perfect for business and for romance too (not so for singles, partiers, families with kids and so on).Elegant, quiet, perfectly located in a very good part of town ... I think the Omni really has it all. It's obsviously not an inexpensive choice, but their rates are very reasonable for what you get.The lobby is beautiful and the rooms extremely clean, quite large and very comfortable, with incredible beds and bathrooms wonderfully appointed with marble and green and black granite. Room service was very good and front desk staff was efficient.One of the definite pluses of the hotel is the express check-out. So efficient, as you bypass the usual check-out procedures (unless you disagree with the price to pay). You gave them your credit card when checking-in, so finding your final bill in an envelope at your door room the final morning and simply leaving is always a great thing.The restaurant is average and quite overpriced, but I guess this is somewhat usual in this kind of properties. It was definitely what I like the least. You don't need to pay such prices for breakfast or dinner, especially considering you will find plenty of fantastic places to eat at reasonable prices in nearby North Beach and all over the city.The location is the very best I could personally ask for. I understand that those who visit San Francisco for the first time usually prefer to stay in Union Square (which, by the way, is within walking distance) or in Fisherman's Wharf (which I would never recommend), but, for me, the area around the Omni is the very best. for the following reasons:a) The area is very nice and you're within walking distance to places such as Union Square, North Beach, Chinatown, the Embarcadero, the cable car turntable, and so on.b) It is very quiet, as it is located at the edge of the financial district.So, when I have enough budget for it, the Omni is, for all those reasons and more, my personal choice in San Francisco, my very favourite city."
263,2131,"Dec 17 2007 	Great hotel for an anniversary stay	My husband and I decided to splurge on a nice hotel for our third wedding anniversary. We live only an hour from San Francisco, but wanted to eat a nice dinner there, plus we had tickets for a football game the next afternoon. We got a decent price for a one-night stay, and we got more than our money's worth at this very luxurious hotel! The staff was incredibly friendly, the standard room was very comfortable, and it's an overall beautiful place. I liked the complimentary bath robes, and the toiletries in the bathroom smelled wonderful! The bar/lounge is nice, although the bartender on shift at the time was a little stiff. Check-in was quick, although we checked in online ahead of time and they didn't have our folio ready. Loved the warm apple cider and cookies they had available for guests downstairs! The hotel is in a great location near Union Square, although we didn't do any sight-seeing since we just had dinner and the football game in mind for our stay. I can't speak to the restaurant (we had breakfast at Starbucks a couple of blocks away) or the business traveler amenities, but I'm sure they're quite nice.NOTE: Parking is a MAJOR expense at San Francisco hotels, and this one is no exception! We did our homework and found a 24-hour city lot one block up the street to park our car - St. George's Square lot, I believe. We only paid $7 for the night (although I think the cashier made an error...it still would have been cheaper than the $45 the hotel would have charged us for valet)."
264,2131,"Dec 13 2007 	Hotel stay part was great marred by concierge and steakhouse	We were there the day after Thanksgiving. It had a nice upscale feel for a reasonable rate of about $160 for a regular room (Thanksgiving weekend). Perfect if you want something nice that is kid friendly. Our family had a room, and the other family we were traveling with had 2 rooms with connecting doors. Both of our families have children ages 5 to 11. We loved the pretty hotel, decked out for the holidays. We loved its proximity to Chinatown (5 mins walk), and around 10 min walk to Union Square. It was a block away from a Walgreens and McDonalds, which is convenient if you have kids. The children loved their Omni backpacks and the complimentary milk and cookies. The staff is nice and attentive, they clean the room 2x/day. Downside is the concierge. They gave wrong information on restaurants twice - once they gave the wrong address to a restaurant they recommended at the Fisherman's Wharf. Another time they assured (and refused to double check) that a restaurant will be open for Thanksgiving dinner. When we got there, the restaurant was closed. They also were not aware of a fun pack that the Omni loans to kids that contains games and activities and such.For the restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steakhouse... It was &quot;ok&quot;. One thing a steak purist would frown on is that the steak comes to you with a humongous giant single carrot right in the middle of the plate as if it is the main dish. The steak and the potatoes are to its left and right. Also, the carrot was dripping in glaze that contaminated our steak. When we inquired about this, they said that it is a Bob's Steakhouse signature (putting the carrot in the middle), but you can always ask to put it on the side."
265,2131,"Dec 9 2007 	Great Hotel in a Great City	My partner and I stayed at the Omni for a long weekend, we are former residents of San Francisco and are well acquainted with The City and all it has to offer. The Omni is ideally located, within walking distance to Union Square (great shopping), Belden Place (great dining) and the Cable Car stops right outside the front door of the hotel. We found the staff to be friendly, accommodating and quite professional, the hotel itself has the feel of a smaller boutique hotel and is an excellent choice for lodging. Definitely plan to stay here again in the near future."
266,2131,"Dec 8 2007 	Top San Francisco Hotel	Two nights on business. Second time at this excellent hotel. Consider this one of the best chain hotels I've stayed in and one of the best in Sand Francisco. All requests made during reservations are met by the Omni. On the way to airport left cell phone in limo and Lex Doherty, the excellent concierge, arranged for the phone to be sent by FED EX to my home the following morning. Hotel has added touches such as a creative way of giving you a semi-complimentary continental breakfast... coffee and juice are free... with minimal charges for extras. CB is delivered to your room with newspapers without all the formality of room service. They leave at door so you don't have to answer immediately early in the AM. Excellent location and very convient and friendly staff."
267,2131,"Dec 8 2007 	Beautiful Hotel A+	The hotel is beautiful and the location could not be more perfect! However it is the staff at the Omni that makes this hotel above the rest. Upon our arrival the front desk assisted my daughter and myself to plan tours, directions and transportation for our stay. Joey &quot;suggested&quot; not pushed on several choices based on our interests. As we were in the first few minutes of unpacking in our room, Joey sent complimentary refreshments via roomservice. The extra attention the entire staff including the housekeeping service was beyond our expectations. Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. Chinatown and Union Square are within walking distance. Other transportation we purchased the 3 day muni pass and rode the trolley and cable cars to every destination on our list. The suggested tours of Muir Woods and Napa Wine Country were awesome. Tower Tours picked us up from the hotel front door, they were well worth every cent. The tour guide named Will was outstanding. It is recommended 100%. We will certainly return to the Omni for our next visit to this fantastic city and would not even consider another hotel. Although we did not dine at Bob's, I regret not having done so. It will be on the list the next visit!"
268,2131,"Dec 7 2007 	bland 	we had great expectations regarding our stay at this hotel after reading all the reviews on tripadvisor. We were also able to book 3 nights at a very good rate through omni's website. There was nothing wrong with this hotel except that it was exceptionally bland. It was comfortable (but so are courtyard hotels) &amp; clean (as you would expect) but it had no zing.Not that we were looking for nightlife but, like much of america, it was so processed it was boring. The front desk staff where ok but lacked any connection with their guests (this is, I admit, very common in the states - &quot;have a happy day&quot;!)When we arrived to the room both my wife &amp; I were glad that we had only paid $135USD not the usual $250-$400, as that was what it was worth.We had just come from the Signature MGM in Las Vegas which knocked us out!"
269,2131,"Nov 28 2007 	Great Place Great Location!	This was the last leg of our Honeymoon (having already been to Vegas and Hawaii) and we were looking for a relaxed atmosphere and comfort and we struck gold again!...The hotel was lovely and clean, the staff friendly and the food excellent in the attached Bobs Steakhouse...hint - try the Massive onion rings..mmmmmm.... just in the right place for you to get to the embarcadero for the F-trams or walking, or turn right to tackle the big ole hills (well worth it!)...Cant fault the place at all!...a perfect end to a perfect honeymoon...S"
270,2131,"Nov 21 2007 	Great Location Nice Hotel	I stayed at the Omni in San Francisco 11/10/07 for 1 night. I have been to San Francisco many, many times and this rates as one of the best hotels I've stayed at. They have a great location, the rooms were above average, and they have a restaurant that is definitely better than most hotel restaurants. (Bob's Chophouse)What prompted me to stay at this Omni for the first time in San Francisco was a free upgrade room pass I received for my horrible stay at the Omni in Austin, TX. I swore after that experience that I wouldn't stay again at an Omni, but wanted to use the upgrade and liked this location. Well, the upgrade (and what I was told I'd receive when I made the reservation) would have been an upgraded courtyard view. That didn't happen...we were given the inferior room anyway with an alley view so they didn't even utilize the upgrade or give us the room promised. If that hadn't occurred my experience would have been rated as &quot;excellent&quot;."
271,2131,"Nov 20 2007 	Overall a great place to stay	We stayed at the Omni Hotel a family of 4 including 2 small children, for 2 nights. On arrival my children were given a backpacks with gifts from the hotel which they were delighted with, checkin was also very quick and staff friendly. Our room was a deluxe room it was very comfortable, classically decorated and very nicely finished. The lobby area of the hotel is also very grand with beautiful chandliers and staircase. The hotel is a very short walk from china town where we enjoyed a meal one night, the only downside to the hotel was the valet parking, A call had to be made to request your car 20 minutes prior, we did this 4 times during our stay and twice had to wait another 10 minutes also. Parking rates are expensive at 50 dollars a night.This aside the hotel and our room were lovely and all dealings we had with the staff , we found them to be helpful and friendly."
272,2131,Nov 10 2007 	excellent	The staff and hotel were superb. Customer service from every staff member was amazing - recommendations for dining and attractions were right on - never too busy to help. The location of the hotel was terrific for walking to many of the prime tourist areas - safe and secure. Our room on the 5th floor was opulent.
273,2131,"Nov 8 2007 	Excellent service	This is an excellent quality hotel right in the heart of SF. The service from all staff was superb, location good, bar &amp; restaurant great and so on!!This was just a quick one night stay before flying back to Europe. I was intrigued by the &quot;most romantic hotel in SF&quot; label when searching as we were at the end of our Honeymoon. Truth is it's a chain hotel that pretends not to seek out the corporate clients even though there were plenty of them. However, unlike so many other big name chains, the Omni seems to treat it's private guests very specially going that little step further for customer service. (Too often I find the chains trying to get the corporate money and just neglect those of us that want a nice hotel).Lots of nice little touches too numerous to mention here means I shall return here (and to any other Omni).And was it romantic? - Well this is not a boutique hotel - it's a large-ish city centre hotel. But given those constraints - surprisngly yes!"
274,2131,"Nov 4 2007	Great Rooms Great Management OK Location (for us)	We stayed at the Omni based on reviews and overall pricing compared to other similarly rated large Hotels in San Francisco. We arrived quite late on a Thursday evening (9:30pm Pacific) due to our flight from Atlanta. We had booked online and I had asked for an upper level no-smoking room. There was no availability for either unfortunately I was told and initially we were placed in a smoking-permitted floor and room. I called the front-desk to ask if any accomodation could be made. The night manager, a wonderful person named Ellen K., indicated she would have us moved to another deluxe room that was non-smoking if we didn't mind moving to another room on our third day/night's stay. This was fine with us. Ellen subsequently called back a few minutes later and said the third night would be an upgraded deluxe suite room on an upper floor because of the trouble (at no extra charge of course). The entire stay was extremely nice, the BellHop area held an extra bag for us for three days while we went to Big Sur in a Miata and provided the bag as needed. Overall a great customer service environment. And the rooms/beds/furnishing was top-notch. The only possible knock is that the hotel is in the financial district. The night-life areas, such as Union Square and North Beach, are within a few blocks walking distance so this is a minor point-of-note. Don't wear heels like my wife did though."
275,2131,"Oct 25 2007 	Top Notch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	The hotel was top notch all the way. From express check in upon late evening arrival, to complimentary coffee, juice and paper delivered every morning to the room.The room was elegant and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was fantastic with wonderful toiletries.The workout room was private, just the right size and had complimentary water and fruit at all times.To top it all off, upon checkout they offered to take us via their Lincoln Town Car to our car rental agency in lieu of us taking a taxi.Would definetely stay here again!"
276,2131,"Oct 24 2007	Horrible Experience with the Management	My stay at the Omni San Francisco started out poorly when I requested a double room (with two double beds) but received a queen room (with one queen). I asked for a rollaway bed, and ages later received a ridiculous inflatable bed not suitable for a comfortable nights sleep. I managed, but it was very uncomfortable. The worst part, however, came after my stay when I had a $300 charge on my credit card. I called to inquire about the charge and they proceeded to tell me it was for room damage. I had no idea what they were talking about and after further investigation, they told me there was a hole in the wall of the room we stayed in. I of course asked for the manager to call me, and was extremely taken aback at how I was treated. He was pompous and rude and immediately accused me of putting the hole in the wall. He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state. I told him that they did, and that my friend (who I immediately phoned afterwards) actually saw the hole  but forgot to mention it to me (it was at the bottom of the wall near the baseboard in the hallway near the door, making it easy to miss). After I relayed this to the manager, he made a snide remark about how guests of his hotel are high-class and would call and complain if they received a room with a hole in the wall. Having no idea of the consequences of not reporting the hole, my friend didn't feel he needed to say anything and thus I never knew about it. The manager was horribly condescending and from his last remark implied that I was not a high-class guest and didnt belong at his hotel. I again assured him that the hole was not from me and he had no proof. He again insisted that his staff does not make mistakes and would never rent out a room with a hole in the wall. I was not going to budge and insisted that he reverse the charge. After going back and forth for awhile, he finally succumbed and reversed the charge. However, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I should not have had to defend my honor, and I knew he thought I was lying even after he reversed the charge. Even though I got the charge reversed, I still didnt feel like I won. This hotel should not be four-star, as four-star hotels would never treat their guests like this. The Omni San Francisco is a third-rate hotel with mediocre customer service and horrible management. Yes, it was bad luck that I got that room, but my experience with the management was enough to make me write this review and encourage travelers to stay somewhere else."
277,2131,"Oct 18 2007	Excellent Service	I have to say I am probably one of the most pickiest individuals with food and service. I will say the Omni surpassed my expectations. The rooms are nice enough (the beds, furniture, and TV) could be updated with more modern furnishings, but after that, the hotel is not only in a great location but their staff is extremely customer oriented and surpasses what you would get at any other hotel. I had one small problem with a smoker being in the room before me and the staff bent over backwards to get the problem corrected and comped a breakfast (with me asking) for the hassle. The check in was very easy and the food and drink in the bar was very good.I was very pleased and would stay there again."
278,2131,"Oct 18 2007 	Great staff great location	Location - - just a few blocks from Nob Hill (Cable Car Museum, Grace Cathedral and fabulous views), China Town and Union Square! The cable car stops at the corner just outside the hotel.The architecture in the Financial district is also gorgeous. That said, it is the Financial district and there is not much open on the weekend. (even Starbucks is closed on Sat and Sun!) You'll need to walk a few blocks for a coffee on the weekend.Staff - - The front desk staff is pleasant and very helpful. The door staff is fantastic. They give stellar directions, hail cabs in driving rain and even secured us a ride in an 'off duty' limo. Housekeeping is quick and thorough and very nice."
279,2131,"Oct 12 2007 	Terrific hotel in San Francisco	Omni is in the business district of San Francisco on California St. The room was very comfortable for 2, clean and quiet. Service was excellent. Bob's Chop House had breakfast that ran $25 but there is a Subway across the street. The restaurant seems to cater to the Business Lunch crowd. The concierge recommended a 3 day transit pass for $18. We walked out the door and literally stepped on a cable car. In other areas people were waiting 20 minutes to do the same.Concierge also recommended we take a city tour from Tower Tours . It too was excellentI'd stay there again."
280,2131,Oct 8 2007 	Excellent hotel in quiet location	Hotel lived up to the Omni reputation from check in through to check out. Room was clean and standard high - toiletries were top notch!! Location is in the financial district so not too much on the doorstep but all within easy distance and trolley right outside the door. No panhandlers outside which for SF is a blessing!Restaurant looked good and is recommended in guides but we didn't eat there as it is very pricy. The bar was expensive too but cosy and relaxing.Staff were very helpful and you could even buy a MUNI pass (highly recommend for value and convenience) at the desk.We were celebrating our 10th anniversary and at check in I was given a red rose and in our room was complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Beautiful touch and greatly appreciated after a long flight.
281,2131,"Oct 1 2007 	Solid Four Star Property	Great location on California Street, centrally located to the financial district, Chinatown, and Union Square. It's right across the street from the Bank of America building, which helps you find the hotel if you're not familiar with San Francisco streets.Check in was very professional and courteous. I was able to secure an early check in at 10:00 am. It's a mid-sized property, compact, yet business smart and understated luxurious. Getting from your room to one of the conference rooms takes only a couple of minutes at most. Elevators are fast. Rooms are average sized, very comfortable, with nice bedding. Lighting is excellent for in-room working. Bathroom was upscale with granite counters, marble floor, large mirror, nice lighting, make up mirror, scale, and a roomy bathtub. Upscale bath amenities are provided. The banquet food was excellent and well-prepared. Did not try room service or restaurants. Express checkout made my departure smooth and quick."
282,2131,"Sep 30 2007 	Good value	Nice, clean rooms. Very efficient and friendly check-in and check-out. Excellent value. The steaks at Bob's downstairs are indeed terrific, and so are the views from the top floor of the Bank of America building opposite."
283,2131,"Sep 26 2007 	Four stars feels like five...	My husband and I stayed at the Omni for our first anniversary and loved it! The staff was SO nice from the moment we walked in the door. They were happy to help and full of information.The location is perfect. It's an easy walk to China Town and Little Italy. It's also about a 10 minute walk to Embarcadero shopping.The rooms were great. We had a small suite, and the toilettries were upscale products that I've only seen in Neiman Marcus. The rooms are very clean and the bed was really comfortable.The hotel restaurant is Bob's Steak and Chop House. There is no wireless internet available - in the room or in the lobby.I would absolutely recommend the Omni to anyone interested in a fairly luxurious hotel experience."
284,2131,"Sep 20 2007 	Faultless	After two weeks travelling we stayed for three nights here. Uniformly good service from staff. Rooms were welcoming &amp; spacious without being too impersonal. Teenagers got cookies each night, we got an ice-bucket filled and chocolates.Good clean bathrooms. Interconnecting rooms a plus. Surprisingly quiet for central location. Walkable to main shopping &amp; to China town restaurants. On cable car route. Don't bother with valet parking it is only one block to easy parking. Take a cable for the internet. Small but pleasant bar."
285,2131,"Sep 15 2007 	Excellent Hotel	My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the Omni in San Francisco and we were so impressed with this hotel, we were compelled to write about it. The price is so affordable that you really don't expect to be 'wowed' by the hotel. But our expectations were far exceeded.The service of every staff member we came in contact with was exemplary. The Front Desk personnel were so helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, etc. They even booked a (future) dinner for us at a restaurant in Napa Valley, which was the next leg of our vacation.The Front Desk personnel, Bellboys, the Doormen, the Housekeeping staff---every single person treated us like royalty. Our room was perfectly clean when we arrived, the front desk staff went out of their way to see that we had a room with a view, and they always followed up by phone to make sure we received whatever service we had requested. Additionally, the location of the Omni is ABSOLUTELY excellent. We walked EVERYWHERE. To the Ferry Building every day, to Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, to Ghiaradelli Square, to Lombard Street, to dinner each night. We never had to take a taxi or other type of transportation. Granted, some of the walks were steep uphill climbs, but that was part of the inate charm of the city. What a fantastic, albeit short time we had in San Francisco. And many thanks to the Omni for making our stay so thoroughly enjoyable. Steve and Tammy Lunn, Laytonsville, Maryland"
286,2131,"Sep 15 2007 	Great location	The hotel had a great location - we walked to North Beach, China Town, the Ferry building and shopping in downtown and felt safe in the area. They switched out their room service menus 1/2 way through our stay and the prices went from reasonable to pretty expensive. R/S was always on time and they were friendly.Our room was small with two double beds, one chair and a desk but it was well kept and housekeeping was very good. Our room was by an elevator on the 8th floor so I was a bit worried that it would be noisy but it was very quite. Service was good in the hotel but sometimes the door staff was a bit too casual.We ate one night in the bar off of the lobby and the food was good as was the service. We also ate at the Market Bar down by the Ferry building twice - once for lunch and once for brunch. It was great and had inside and outside seating available. The Ferry building also had some great gourmet food stores and retail shops. We had dinner at Home in the Lower Haight area and it was very good. It had simple food and a nice atmosphere.Overall the hotel was a great jumping off location to most points in the city and it was a hassle free stay in a safe location."
287,2131,"Sep 13 2007 	Perfect Service at the Omni	We stayed at the Omni San Francisco for 3 nights at the Labour Day weekend.It was the last stop of our honeymoon to the US and we couldn't have made a better choice.We were upgraded to a Bay View Room on the top floor (17th floor).My wife was given a rose at check in, they brought us a bottle of champaign and chocolate-coated strawberries and had arranged our bathrobes with another rose the first evening.Room service was simply outstanding.I highly recommend joining the free OMNI Select Guest programme which entitles you to complimentary WIFI, beverage and newsparer service.Staff was charming, attentive and helpful with the exception of one gruffy bellman.Dined once at Bob's Steakhouse (belonging to the hotel), waiters so so, but great food, had a perfect filet mignon.Cable Car line runs just in front of the house.The only minor drawbacks:- WIFI service doesn't work on the 17th floor which they &quot;somehow forgot&quot; to mention at check-in (however, as Select guest you can use the cable internet free of charge)- walls are quite thin (the same old story everywhere...)- parking: as usual in SF, street parking is a mess and the hotel charges a hefty 40$ valet fee for 24 hours + 6$ city tax.Hotel is within walking distance of Ferry Building, Embaracadero, Coit Tower, Market Street, Chinatown and SOMA.Would highly recommend and always return there."
288,2131,"Sep 11 2007 	Travel Agent's review	My husband and I just returned from a wonderful 4 nights at the Omni, and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel.Arrival - we opted for public transportation, taking the BART from SFO airport to Montgomery st and walked up the street to the hotel (maybe a 10 minute walk) It cost us $5.15 per person rather than $42 for a taxi from the airport, and it took about 40 minutes.Check in/out - I had notified the hotel that we would be arriving early (10am) and we received our room right away. We were also permitted to check out late, at 1pm.Staff - were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. I had notified the hotel that it was my husband's birthday, and they sent up a bottle of wine (which was pretty good), a fruit and cheese platter and a birthday card. We had nightly turndown service and were given a weather report for the next day, and chocolates.Room - beautifully decorated room, comfortable king size bed, nice ammenities in the bathroom. There was a desk and an armchair with an ottoman - perfect for relaxing and putting your feet up after a long day of walking!Location - in the financial district, but within walking distance to all the sights (if you like to walk!) The hotel is very close to North Beach (Little Italy) and China town, where we enjoyed a few meals. The ferry building/market was a short 10 minute walk, and pier 39 &amp; Fisherman's Wharf were about a 25-30 minute walk away. We walked everywehre, and never found anywhere too far or more of a 1/2 hour walk. Concierge gave us maps and directions to all the places that we wanted to visit. There were also a few good nightclubs and pubs just around the corner from us.* Sign up for the free Signature guest program - you get juice and a paper every morning and nightly turndown service with a chocolate!Sights / recommendations* Alcatraz - we did the night tour (booked in advance), it was cool, and kinda spooky to be there at night.* Pier 39 - the sealions were one of our highlights, you could watch them play / fight for hours! We ate at Bubba Gump's (just for the novelty of it) but the food was lousy and overpriced.* Fisherman's Wharf - nice to walk around, lots of souvenir shops and fresh seafood stands.* Giradelli Square - go for the sundaes, they are worth the $8!* Lombard St - worth the walk up this hill / crooked street* Tonga Room - just up the street (hill) from the hotel (at the Fairmont Hotel) we went for the $8 happy hour buffet, well worth a visit for an early dinner, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, especially when it &quot;rains.&quot;* AT &amp; T park - saw a Giants game (bought tickets there), what a nice park, with beautiful views of the bay (if you get the right seats - we were on club level)* Ferry Building / Market - there was always some kind of street performance going on there.We'd definately return to the Omni!"
289,2131,"Sep 11 2007 	Excellent Stay	Stayed here with my husband for one night as an anniversary weekend getaway. The hotel was clean and the lobby is gorgeous. Reminded me of the Titanic movie with its 1920's decor. The rooms are spacious...a bit old, but very clean. The front desk was friendly and the hotel really does go out of its way to make you feel welcomed. Upon check in, my husband I were greeted with a rose for me and congrats on our wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to the 17th floor and given a room with a view of the bay. Nice! Then hotel sent a martini glass full of chocolate truffles and a small bottle of red wine with a card that wished us happy anniversary. Totally cute and a pleasant surprise.The hotel is defintely worth its value."
290,2131,"Sep 10 2007	Omni is heaven	The Omni was great! The room was clean, comfortable and the service at the hotel was second to none. We loved the coffee/juice and paper deliverey to the room each morning. The evening turn down service was perfect at the end of a long day! I very much recommend the Omni and we will definitely stay there again."
291,2131,"Sep 10 2007 	Beautiful hotel	I booked the Omni based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor and the Hotel was even more amazing than all of the reviews would have you believe. The rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly, attentive and helpful and the room service was fantastic. It's also extremely convenient to the cable car and Chinatown. I would definitely return to the Omni San Fran."
292,2131,"Sep 5 2007	Downtown Hotel But with a little more soul than most	This could be just a standard downtown hotel, but it's better than average. The staff is friendly, the housekeeping staff leaves you cute notes, they gave us a rose because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary...The location is very central. The cable cars stop outside and it's only five blocks to the Ferry Terminal Building.It exceeded my expectations."
293,2131,"Sep 4 2007 	The Omni is fantastic	What a great stay. We had signed up for the Select Guest membership and received complimentary beverages in the morning and evening turndown service. We got to check in early - like 9 am - and were always given great directions and advice for siteseeing. Our room was in great condition - really clean. The location was great too, as it was within walking distance of transportation, shopping, dining, etc. I would definitely stay here again!"
294,2131,"Sep 3 2007 	Perfect Omni Weekend Getaway	I love staying in wonderful hotels, so when my boyfriend and I chose to escape the Los Angeles heatwave and enjoy a romantic getaway in San Francisco, The Omni was the perfect choice. We drove and arrived at 3:00 am and were greeted even in the wee hours with a perfect check in and a smile. Our room was on the 16th floor and had great architectural views of nearby buildings. The room was elegant and cozy with top notch Molton Brown bath products. The hotel location is close to everything and you can walk to all points of interest such as Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach, SFMOMA, Yuerba Buena Gardens, etc. Weather was perfect, concierge made dinner reservations to the Carnelian Room for us on the 52nd Floor of the B of A Building which has spectacular views of SF. It was perfect. We took a trolley from the wharf back to the hotel and were dropped off right in front of the Omni. It doesn't get much better than that!"
295,2131,"Sep 1 2007 	Great hotel and location.	This hotel is in a great location, on a cable car line, near to china town and opposite a great restaurant in the bank of america builing. Our room was of good quality fixtures and fittings, staff were very helpful, with a nice bar area looking onto the street.Hotel is about a 10 minute waalk to union square for shopping, 15 minute walk to the nearest pier area and bay bridge.Fishermans wharf is a cab or bus ride. Book alcatraz prison tour before you arrive in san fran. Open top otur bus of city worth doing as well.No free parking at hotel, have to use car parks opposite, which are not cheap."
296,2131,"Aug 24 2007 	Elegant hotel and amazing steak restaurant!	We stopped here for three nights as part of our honeymoon. The hotel looks very elegant and the front desk staff are extremely welcoming. They are very happy to offer you advice about 'the sights' and will make every effort to make you feel a valued customer. The price, which is not excessive, was justified in the quality. I'd told them that it was our honeymoon when I booked the room. When we arrived we had been upgraded to a beautiful room on the 16th (out of 17) floor. When we got to the room we were greeted with huge strawberries dipped in dark chocolate, chilled sparkling wine, red wine, fresh fruit, mineral water all dressed with orchid heads and a hand written note congratulating us. It was really wonderful.The room was a very good size, bathroom fantastic - Molton Brown products. Bed was extremely comfortable with very good quality linen. The whole hotel was very clean and the housekeeping staff clearly took pride in their work. There was even a note welcoming us to the hotel from the member of staff responsible for our room- very nice touch.We had breakfast and dinner in Bob's Steakhouse. The breakfast was nice but nothing outstanding. Service on both occasions was good. The steak however was simply the best either of us have ever tasted! We both had the fillet mignon, it was cooked perfectly to our request. Fabulous.I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will happily book hotels within this chain again."
297,2131,"Aug 21 2007 	Excellent Stay	The Omni San Francisco really was absolutely wonderful. We got a great deal on their website, and we were really thrilled with the room, the lobby, the bar, and the location. The hotel is just a short cable car ride to almost all the tourist attractions, while also in a very safe area. We were very impressed and would definitely recommend it.As an added bonus, I accidentally left my wedding band on the nightstand the morning of our checkout, I finally noticed it when we were driving down the coast on the Pacific Coast Highway...I called the front desk, they connected me to housekeeping, and housekeeping overnighted it to our next hotel in Monterey that very day. Exceptional service."
298,2131,Aug 20 2007 	If only other hotels can learn from this Omni	Our family of four stayed at the Omni San Francisco for a too short 4-day weekend. We have stayed at a number of other hotels (including the Ritz-Carlton) over the years and can honestly say that this was the absolute best experience we have ever had. Everyone on staff was incredible and made us feel that we were the only guests there even though the hotel was sold out! This is the only hotel to be in San Francisco!
299,2131,"Aug 20 2007 	Easy walk to various sites: Union Square by muni cable car BART	After reading the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor, we used HotWire for our one night at the Omni, at a reasonable rate. (less than $200). We experienced the same outstanding service as previous posts mentioned, so I will try not to repeat information, except to recognize our concierge Justin Seeto who sent chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne to our room while we were out, to congratulate us on our anniversary.We called the Front Desk to thank him for the treats. Later, (most likely) our concierge also surprised us with a small bottle of wine, along with more chocolates, probably delivered during turndown service.I had also signed up for Omni's free Select Membership benefits online: i.e.complimentary morning newspaper - notify Front Desk which one, complimentary morning beverages - write on Breakfast menu tag and hang outside door before going to sleep, late check out - after 12 noon but notify Front Desk, evening turndown service, etc.We parked at St. Mary's Garage (entrance on left-side, 1/2 block before California, while driving north on Kearny). $32 for 24 hrs. No in-out privileges, but we didn't need our car since we could take public transportation everywhere, or walk a few blocks to Union Square/Chinatown/North Beach/Market St.We walked less than 10 min. to the Embarcadero stop on the F line (SFMTA's Muni ) to Pier 29/Chestnut St. to enjoy a dinner &amp; show at Teatro Zinzanni. We enjoyed this European-style cabaret, focused on fun through comedy, music, Cirque du Soleil-style feats, audience participation/interaction, and a 5-course dinner. Since the seats are arranged in concentric circles, all views are good. We hardly noticed that 3 hours had passed when the show ended as we ate dessert.We also saw the da Vinci exhibit at the Metreon (4th/Mission, south of Market), closing Dec. 31. The range of inventions displayed and re-created was astounding, especially the precursors to modern inventions. If you show a BART ticket until Aug. 31, you get a $4 discount off the adult admission price.We may take our kids next time for an Omni stay, or go by ourselves again!"
300,2131,"Aug 18 2007	NIce Stay Absolutely Beautiful	This hotel was and absolutely exquisite place...The Lobby was beautiful, and the Hotel Restaurants were GREAT!!!Recommended even for families with children!Also, it was in a great part of San Fransisco!!!"
301,2131,"Aug 15 2007 	Lots of Class	From the minute you step into the lobby and the eager (but not overly) front desk staff greet you, you know you're in for a great stay.The lobby is beautiful with seating areas for cocktails or dining... all sparkling and impressive. Great steakhouse and bar located in the hotel too...Right on California Street on the Nob Hill cable car line, you can close the double glazed windows and not hear a thing, or slide em up a little for some ambient SF street noise... it's great.The room I had was a king bedded room in front of the hotel on the 11th floor with a view of the Bank of America building. Great pillows! Firm but comfortable bed. The bathroom was marble and antiqued. The amenities were awesome (Pecksniffs) and just everything about the room was classy. It is a very smart choice in SF compared to some of the other long standing Nob Hill establishments who have seemed to take a turn for the worse in recent years (Stanford Court, Fairmont, Huntington).A great business or adult getaway hotel."
302,2131,"Aug 13 2007 	Fantastic !!!	We just returned from a long weekend visit to San Francisco celebrating our 36th wedding anniversary and stayed at the Omni. The room was beautiful and impeccably clean. The service and accommodations were wonderful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Since it was our anniversary, the maid had arranged towels in the shape of a heart with a nice little heart shaped note beside it. Our concierge Vida Lau at check-in congratulated us on our anniversary and said that something would be sent up to us later. Well, upon our return after a little walk in China Town there was a small bottle of champagne &quot;chilled&quot; with glasses along with some chocolate covered strawberries. And Vida had sent along a little note. Whenever we wanted to take a tour or ask about transportation either the doorman or the concierge were so very helpful. We had our breakfasts and one dinner at Bob's restaurant there and the meals were wonderful and so was the service. My husbnad and I agree that this by far was not only one of our favorite vacations but these were the best accommodations and service that we have EVER had at a hotel."
303,2131,"Aug 6 2007 	Loved the Omni	We stayed at the Omni only 2 nights and have never been to San Francisco. The hotel is very plush and well designed. The only problem is the walls are not thick enough to drown out noise from other rooms. We heard our neighbors come in at 1 am and they were quite noisey. The location is in the middle of many attractions so we were able to walk to most everything - although it's quite hilly! Dorian was a major attribute to our wonderful stay. He is a bell guy who was cheerful, wonderful to be around and gave us lots of useful information about a city we hadn't been to before. You've got to meet him! Overall, this is a hotel worth staying at!"
304,2131,"Jul 30 2007 	Perfection	What an amazing experience! Staying at the Omni was the cherry on top of our stay. Excellent service, impeccable room, and fabulous location. The staff is really great too. They even left my daughter a cookie and milk in the room our first night there. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for luxury in San Francisco. Short walk from both Union Square shops and Chinatown."
305,2131,"Jul 29 2007	Completely exceeded our high expectations	We just returned after spending several days at the Omni. We booked the hotel based on in part the reviews we read here.The hotel is quite beautiful, as we expected, but what we didn't expect was the service. We've stayed in many beautiful hotels, but no one has ever treated us as well as we were treated here.The staff went out of their way to help us, giving us hints that we didn't think to ask about, planning tips that we didn't know about and overall treated us as if we were the only guests instead of one of many.Aside from the great service, the restaurant was delicious and location was perfect.What a great stay!"
306,2131,"Jul 28 2007	1st Omni stay - Great!	We stayed at the Omni for our wedding anniversary. Beautiful hotel in the financial district, because of that the weekends are fairly &quot;quiet&quot; because the businesses are not working. Chinatown is a quick walk and not too far down to the piers. We would stay here again."
307,2131,"Jul 27 2007 	Great price	The location was pretty good, the rooms were very nice, but the view was &quot;so-so&quot;. We had a view of another building located behind the Omni. I can't complain though cause we got it for an awesome rate off travelzoo.com.I would stay here again!"
308,2131,"Jul 26 2007 	Flawless	Booked a room using Priceline and was lucky enough to get the Omni San Francisco. The hotel pays attention to every detail, and I mean EVERY detail. Upon arrrival at the centrally located hotel, we were greeted by the doorman and others willing to help with baggage. There was a bit of a line at the check in desk and one of the bellmen quickly realized the need for additional resources. After advising those waiting he would secure additional help, he did just that. Soon the line was gone and everyone checked in quickly. The reservation was under my name but they allowed my wife to check in while I parked the car, simply asking that I return to the desk with my ID and credit card at some point durign our stay. Now that is service.When we arrived at the well appointed room, there was a hand written note from the housekeeper welcoming us. That is a first ever!That evening the room was turned down, chocolates were left and the television was tuned to a station that was entirely soothing music and beautiful scenes. Again, what an amazing touch.When we returned to the hotel on day 2, another hand written note from the housekeeper indicating she hoped we had a wonderful day, this time the note was personalized to us (vs. Dear Guest). We visited the bar as well and while the drinks were quite pricey ($15 for a martini) the atmosphere and service were perfect. I would highly recommend the Omni. Many others before me have given high ratings and I completely concurr. Excellent, absolutely excellent."
309,2131,"Jul 15 2007 	Consistent Quality at the Omni	Stayed here July 6-8. Though this hotel is ostensibly in the &quot;financial district&quot; it is very conveniently located for walking (at the base of Nob Hill) and to public transportation (cable car, for the patient) and BART (take it to the 16th street stop to go to Tartine Bakery at 18th &amp; Guerrero). Pleasant walk to SF MOMA, AME Restaurant at the St. Regis Hotel (recommend) and Bong Su Restaurant. Hotel is representative of the attention to detail and quality that seem to be consistent with the Omni chain. Hotel staff are outgoing and pleasant. Check-in is effortlessly efficient. With &quot;Special Guest&quot; number (only sign up is required), there is free internet in the room. They also provide free beverages in the morning with this SG #. Opening window provides fresh air in the room, though the temperature control in the room is perfect. Nice bathroom amenities - lighted make-up mirror. Superior comfortable bed. Bathroom is a touch tiny. Hotel Manager informs me the hotel is planning a full renovation in 2008, but honestly, everything there is perfectly nice. Did not have an opportunity to use the work out facilities, but they are provided. Check out was automatic and accurate. Car waiting to provide airport transportation - nice not to have to wait for a taxi (and SF taxis make NYC taxis seem positively hygienic)."
310,2131,"Jul 13 2007	Best Hotel in SF 	Best hotel I've stayed in for a long while. Suberb professional service (though I wish there was a doorman opening the door each time I walked through.) Spotless modern class. Easy check in and out and no problems w/ the hotel at all. Location was alright, not that close to Union Sq though.Room size i estimate 300 sq ft. A little narrower than I would've liked but the beds were super comfy. you won't be disappointed."
311,2131,"Jul 2 2007 	Excellent Stay	We have just return from our stay in Omni. Hotel was beautiful. Service was unbelievable. Bathrobe and slippers were provided. Everyone was extremely friendly. Very convenient location, in front of the cable car line, but very quiet on the weekend. We walked to Chinatown, the Coit Tower, Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf. You can also take a bus to all the tourist attractions. Great shower in the bathroom. Loved our stay."
312,2131,"Jun 19 2007	The Omni...beautiful and convenient	The Omni suited my family of four. The room and hotel were beautiful. The level of service given by every employee was unsurpassed. We found the location to be very convenient. Many restaurants were in the area including the resaurants in the foot -traffic -only alley a couple of blocks away. Union Square was within easy walking distance for my husband, me, and daughters, 18 and 20. We took the Powell cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. We took a bus to the Japanese tea garden from Union Square.. We also visited Haight-Asbury from the same location. The Market, Montgomery St. BART station is a few blocks from the hotel and is very convenient for getting to and from the airport.It may be a bit more difficult to get around from this location with small children in tow, but for us, it was perfect!"
313,2131,"May 31 2007 	Great choice if you can get a great rate otherwise maybe not	Found a great deal for Memorial Day weekend....spent five nights here for $139/night (plus taxes).At this rate it was great and well worth my money, otherwise I don't think I'd come here again when rates reach $350+Lobby is fantastic, but as other reviews say, the glamour stops here. That doesn't mean the rest of the hotel is bad.Rooms: Standard rooms are small, but do include a nice size desk. Views from the room are just city block views, nothing exciting. Bathroom was very nice, with marble countertop and shower surround. Room staff left little well-wishing notes and Ghiradelli chocolate squares on the bed each night, a nice touch.Staff: Front desk staff was very helpful.Food: stay away from the breakfast...overpriced like most hotels of this type ($22 for continental breakfast? not for me.) I ordered room service from Bob's Chop House, which is apparently well known in SF as a good steak house. It was pretty good!Location: Easy walk to Ferry Building/Chinatown/Union Square. Beware, there's very little in the way of eating/shopping around the hotel since it's in the financial district....so if you find yourself in the mood for a quick eat, then you'll have to walk somewhere else or eat in the hotel.My next trip I'll probably stay in Union Square instead."
314,2131,"May 31 2007 	Another great stay at the Omni!!!!!!	This was our fourth stay at the Omni and again was not disappointed. On this trip though we also stayed at the SF Marriot due to a buisness commitment. I have to say that we thought the SF Marriot was big, cold and impersonal as compared to the Omni. We loved the cozy feeling of the Omni---smaller hotel, quiet area on the weekend and not bad during the week, a cable car right out front, North Beach a short walk away, the compimentary beverages in the morning, the hot apple cider in the evenings and the fact that we saw the same staff everyday during our stay. They got to know us and were very helpful and attentive to our travel plans. Not so at the SF Marriot! The Deluxe room was well appointed but not luxurious. The bathroom was well light and had a make-up mirror as well (something my girlfriend wanted to point out). We also ate dinner at Bob's Steakhouse and I have to say that was one of the best steaks that I have eaten in a long while----be aware that the prices are not for those on a budget but if you want to splurge then it is well worth it. For the price [though the Select Guest program] the Omni is well worth it. FYI, we have stayed in a Deluxe room to a Signature room from the 6th to 17th floor. We preferred the deluxe room on the 6th floor as we actually enjoyed hearing the clangging of the cable car bell. If you prefer quit then get a room above the 8th floor. Note that the views from the Signature rooms could be blocked by nearby buildings. Overall the Omni has everything I have come to enjoy about it and is our hotel of choice in SF."
315,2131,"May 30 2007 	A great hotel provided you get it at the right price.	My wife and I celebrated out tenth anniversary with a four night stay at the Omni, and were extremely pleased with the service we received. The staff we encountered, from front desk to maid service, were extremely cordial. We returned from our first day's explorations to find a bottle of champagne and dipped strawberries waiting in our room, compliments of the hotel staff. It's rare to see this sort of courtesy across the board, even at a luxury hotel, and it's that kind of attention to detail that leads to the almost unanimous raves you see at Trip Advisor.In addition to the excellent service, the location is great for exploration. We walked to the theatre, some great restaurants in North Beach, and shopping. Cab rides were readily available to anywhere else.I'd definitely pay extra for a Signature rooms on the 16th floor, as the little touches, like a high thread-count sheets, are definitely worth it. The bed is EXTREMELY comfortable. I'd also advise you to sign up for the Omni Club prior to check-in, as membership has some nice freebies, like complimentary beverages and newspapers brought to your room each morning. Free wireless access, too.That said, the decor and furnishings at the Omni are nothing special, rather bland and corporate. Our Signature Room was a bit on the small side, the hallway noise is noticeable, especially in the morning, and the TVs are showing their age, so I would hesitate to pay full rate card here. We booked a $189 Memorial Day Special through Travel Zoo, which is a steep discount from their regular rate. At that price, this place is an incredible bargain, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for business or pleasure."
316,2131,"May 14 2007 	Beautiful 	I loved the Omni Hotel. My boyfirend and I decided to vacation in our own city and treat ourselves to a luxury hotel for a couple nights. The Omni was fabulous. The staff was so friendly and helpful, the rooms comfortable and very clean, th bathrooms all marble. It is located in the Financial district which is a bit dead on the weekends but it is a 4 block walk to the Embarcadero and a quick cab ride to Union Square. I will definitely stay at the Omni again."
317,2131,"May 7 2007 	Great Hotel	Picked Omni from previous reviews... Some may say being on edge of financial district is quiet, well No! We experienced a Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Saturday was very quiet to get going as most local deli's etc within 10 min walk either do not open on Saturday or open later, say 10am which is fine. It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend. Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square, 15 mins tops. Loads of places to eat there. The cable cars are great, get a $11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception, valid for the cars and buses. Rooms are lovely, nice and big and great bathrooms, all marble, rooms have air con big TV , video games etc.We used as base to explore, Lombard street, G Gate bridge, Fishermans Wharf, Italian quarter, Coit Tower. Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy. One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off, hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all. Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street. This one passes over Lombard Street just by the 'crooked street' bit. Great fun standing on the side and leaning out.... which you are not supposed to do of course. We did have one evening meal in the Bob's Steakhouse, attached to hotel and one brealfast. Very good quality although a bit more expensive. Very very busy during the week with business people etc. The bar gets very crowded and noisy but in a nice happy, people enjoying themseleves sort of way.All the staff were very polite and extremely helpful, whatever the question is."
318,2131,"May 4 2007 	First Class hotel	After a work conference in Monterey (avoid the Hyatt Monterey - yuck) my husband and I checked into the Omni for the weekend on the advice from two business traveler friends. We LOVED it! From the moment we pulled up front (valet quickly greeted us, as parking was part of our $175/night rate) we experienced a very high level of service. When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby. The room was spacious and smelled beautiful - can't ever remember a hotel room smelling SO floral....but not overwhelming. Turndown service at night was nice (Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow, fresh ice, robes laid out), and the doormen and valets were extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions. We were also offered (for free) a ride in the hotel's town car to any restaurant/bar/shopping in the near vicinity - nice touch! Keep up the great service Omni!! Will stay again at the Omni - anywhere in the U.S.!!!"
319,2131,"May 4 2007 	Great Hotel- A+	Although I have stayed in many hotels for both business and pleasure,I have never felt compelled to write a review. The Omni impressed me so much that I felt it deserved some of my time to write this review.The hotel exceeded my expectations. Many city centre hotels can be dissapointing irrespective of their star rating, as the rating is normally based on facilities rather than outright quality.The Omni was very pleasant, well located and the staff extremely courteous. I stayed in one of their corner suites which had windows all round. Complimentary fruit and water was provided as well as the staff turning my bed down when night came.The only small gripe I would have is that some of the bar staff were a little &quot;green behind the ears&quot; in terms of their knowledge of cocktails!Thoroughly recommended. I would stay there again."
320,2131,"May 4 2007 	Excellent customer service and beautiful hotel	Planned a last minute getaway to San Francisco last weekend. After reading customer reviews on TA, I decided to select the Omni Hotel. The hotel was awesome! Customer service impeccable. Cleanliness was excellent. Front desk clerks and doormen learned our names quickly and called us by name for the duration of the trip. I would strongly recommend the omni to visitors. Staff very knowledgable on what's going on in town and recommended the best ways to get around. Great location in that it was in the downtown area but a couple of blocks away from all of the hustle and bustle on traffic and people. Would definitely stay there again.A great place to eat Chinese food is the R &amp; G lounge on Kearny Street (two blocks behind the Omni) food was excellent and very affordable."
321,2131,"Apr 20 2007 	Excellent Service Great Customer Followup!	I stayed in the Omni in March 2007. Booked thru priceline and I was looking forward for this stay since all the reviews are wonderful! Unfortunately, my case is slightly different. There were service issues during my stay so I had to move the rooms several times throughout the stay (Bad luck, maybe?). Most of the front desk staffs are very professional and kind. I like the fact the room service is prompt and the bed is very comfortable. Evening turn-down, personal notes and next day's forecast is thoughtful. As previous reviewers described, this hotel has NO view (I stayed at the Hilton FD last time, the views are GEORGIOUS, check my previous post for pictures). There are few types of the rooms and they do have different amenities in the room but the bathrobes are standard feature in every room and nice marble bathroom (except in the accessible rooms you get showers only).  There are few restaurants nearby (Tadich Grill is a must go!) few blocks walk to the bart station. Its not that bad of the area at night to walk around with but however it is a very boring area if nightlife is what you are looking for. Chinatown is nearby but still a bit of walk. The parking situation is bad, you will need to get a parking package or else you are looking to pay $40ish/night for parking. The gym on the 3rd floor is very nicely eqipped as well but I really think that they should add a swim pool / jacuzzi in the hotel. Make sure to join Omni select guest program, thats the way to receive the most perks such as 1. Free morning drinks, 2. discounted morning breakfast ( limited selection, but GREAT price &amp; quality/quantity for room service). 2. Free intenet access for select guest member. 3. Possible room upgrade.Also, Sat morning city walk program is nice experience! you will get to know the history of this area!"
322,2131,"Apr 17 2007 	Lovely Hotel Excellent Service	From the moment we arrived from the UK to the moment we left the staff went out of their way to please us. Walking into the grand lobby everything had an air of professionalism and efficiency. Our room was on the 17th floor with a wonderful view out across to the bay. With this standard of hotel you can expect to find the usual bathrobes and nice arrangement of toiletries, turn down service was provided each night along with the next days weather report, which was a nice idea. The extra touches made you feel that this was a hotel that really cared for their guests. Within a short walk from the hotel were a number of restaurants, shops and cafes around Union square. We enjoyed staying just outside of the main tourist areas however being close enough to easily walk around to places. We will definitely stay again when we visit San Francisco in the future."
323,2131,"Apr 16 2007 	As great as everyone says it is	We booked the Omni after reading a lot of reviews online. It definitely lived up to all the great reviews. The service is incredible, the hotel is clean and the location is great. The front desk manager went out of her way to accomodate our special needs, calling us on her day off. It was all very much appreciated. We didn't eat in the restaurant except for dessert one night and the chocolate cake could feed 4 people! It was delicious. The restuarant recommendations were wonderful from the staff. We walked to Union Square and the hotel is on the California cable car line. If we are to return to San Francisco, we'll definitely stay here again."
324,2131,"Apr 14 2007 	Worked for our weekly vacation!	We arrived and were surprised at how small the lobby was. Not a problem, just a suprise. Our room was fine for the three of us (48, 12, 10) with two double beds. The beds were very comfortable and big enough for the three of us. High ceilings. Nice bathroom. Service was very good. As a Omni Club Member we received free breakfast drinks at the door, free newspapers, and free afternoon brownies. A nice touch. As with many San Fran hotels, no pool. The location was good but not great. We were in the business district near Chinatown. We like walking so this was fine. (We almost picked the Argunaut but decided to not stay at the Wharf --- a good choice I think.) We never tried the hotel restaurant but enjoyed some hearby Chinese and LOVED the food and charm of the Italian neighborhood some blocks away (try The Stinking Rose and Cafe Greco). Walking to the Wharf was not too far for us. We took a taxi back rather than wait an hour for a cable car. (We luckily did not rent a car.) The Omni --- absolutely professional and no problems, but not spectacular. Would recommend if willing to walk around town."
325,2131,"Apr 9 2007 	Great Hotel Staff	From the desk clerks to the maids and doormen you can tell that the managements priority is service. Friendliest hotel I've stayed at, ever."
326,2131,"Mar 27 2007 	Overrated -- Clean Nice but definitely not outstanding.	I am a little amazed at some of the reviews I have read here. Don't get me wrong this is a nice hotel but it doesn't warrant rave reviews, there are some problems.No wireless internet, I can't believe a hotel in the financial district doesn't have wireless internet. The front desk said we needed to &quot;pay 50 bucks&quot; to upgrade to a room with wireless internet. Huh? You have to be kidding me. The doormen (as all the reviews state here) were not (a) very friendly or (b) very helpful. I would suggest hospitality training.Don't be fooled by the candid pics above you probably won't get the room that shows a duvet (that isn't the room we got), this hotel still uses bedspreads -- very unsanitary (anytime you get a room witha bedspread throw it in the corner immediately) they're a haven for bacteria. Otherwise, the bed was clean and comfortable. The bath, amenities, and towels were adequate though not luxurious. This is nota 5 star hotel or comparative to the Four Seasons though it did remind me of a Ritz Carlton.Our first room smelled like smoke but we were relocated quickly, our bill was overcharged for a mini bar item but was corrected and our room service order was wrong but also was corrected after a call. Park at St. Mary's if you are staying on the weekend it 's 1/5 the price of the $45 parking rate and catty corner to the hotel. Plan on paying for parking, it is San Francisco. We probably would not do a car if we stayed in the city again, it's too hard with the steep slopes and we are used to driving a lot.The hotel was clean and the location is off the beaten path a bit although still relatively close to everything. The rooms were really clean and the young man at check in was nice and helpful. We got a great price for the weekend so the hotel was well worth our price it but I sure wouldn't want to pay full price for my stay. I would defintely move up to higher end. hotel if I were paying listed rates.There is no view, it was of another building but that is to be expected in the city.Here are some other tips: We had a cheap great lunch at the mexican restaurant communal dining Mijita at the Ferry Building and parking was only $5 with validation, we enjoyed walking around the Ferry Building marketplace but skipped the touristy Fisherman's Wharf. We took the ferry to Sausalito and that was great. We walked from the hotel to the Fodor reccommended L'Osteria del Forno for dinner - it'sless than a mile, go late or go early there is often a line but it iscash only, tiny but casual and we enjoyed the food. Great for the price."
327,2131,"Mar 23 2007 	The Omni is awesome!	Great location, great room, great stay. The hotel is central to all the tourist activity. The room had a large comfortable bed with a nice desk and large bathroom. The staff was there to help with anything from the moment we walked into the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel for couples looking for a romantic weekend."
328,2131,"Mar 19 2007 	A great hotel	We recently spent four nights in this lovely hotel. The service is &quot;happy to see you&quot; wonderful. The doorman and desk clerk were friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and quiet. One morning, we ate in their small restaurant and the breakfast was teriffic. I recommend this hotel without reservation!"
329,2131,"Mar 15 2007 	Nice Hotel	My family and I stayed at the Omni for a weekend, it was very nice, the hotel location was great, the service was great, the hotel itself is very quite,and we got the best food advice from the guys that work outside. We had the best breakfast from a place I can't recall at the moment, it had a very unusual breakfast specials that were written on a chalkboard. It was a very small place and you have to wait outside for about 30-40 minutes, but it is worth the wait. Will definitely eat there again when I return to S.F. One problem we had at the hotel was taxi service, they usually do not have cabs waiting outside the hotel like other bigger hotels, so they have to flag one down for you,but with everything said, the hotel itself was great!"
330,2131,"Mar 14 2007 	Excellent Hotel Service and Location	I had a overnight flight from Hawaii and arrived at the hotel at 09:00 AM. I had a coupon from the Select Guest Program that enabled me to pay half price on a weekend and get an upgrade. The front desk representitave, Joey Nubla, checked my reservation and saw that my birthday was coming up. He then graciously upgraded me to a suite that was available and later sent a bottle of wine. The suite was large and first class with all the amenties that I have come to expect from Omni. I have stayed in many of there properties, almost always got a complimentary upgrade, and have been very satsified with the accomodations and service.Sincerely,Brent V. Marrott"
331,2131,"Mar 12 2007 	Not bad at all	I spent 8 nights at the Omni when attending a conference in San Francisco. The hotel's location is fantastic, bang in the middle of town without some of the grime associated with Union Square. The public areas and reception are clean and smart. The room was comfortable and quiet (courtyard rooms are quiet but with a view of the neighbouring office block), but very plain - nothing in there to denote it as special in any way. The service, however, was very good indeed - bright and attentive staff at every level from housekeeping to management. Room service food was fantastic, although for the most part I got take-aways from neighbouring Chinatown. I'll certainly use the Omni again."
332,2131,"Mar 10 2007 	Dont be put off by it not being on Market St or in Union Square	A lot of reviews of this fabulous hotel say its in a quiet part of town (financial district) and coming from London you imagine this means that you'll need a taxi to get anwhere and the area will be quite eerie.WRONG.If you have a pair of legs and can walk you can be on Market St/Union Square in 5-10 minutes.I'm used to big busy cities and there is nothing worse than staying in the throbbing throng with all the tourists. For this reason the location of the Omni is a real bonus. Far from the madding crowd but no so far to be any kind of inconvenience.It is true that most of the guests seem to be there on business but its no problem. Dont eat there if you dont want to hear suits talk turkey. Go out and enjoy the many fanatsic restaurants in San Fran instead.TIPS:Join the SelectGuest programme (a kind of clubcard membership) for free in adavnce and then you get a free paper and drink delivered to your room every morning at a time you specify. You also get the option of ordering light breakfast items at an extremely reasonbale rate. (cream cheese toatsted bage was about $3 or 1.50).The gym is stocked with complimentary water and fresh(ish) fruit. 'Nuff said on that one!Free internet service in the lobby.If noise bothers you stay as high up as possible. (on the 5th you can hear the tram bells, on the 13th you can hear nothing).You can buy your MUNI passes from the fornt desk at their face value.If travelling without too much luggage do yourself a favour at SFO and use the BART rather than pay for a taxi. A jounrey on the BART is only $5.15 and the walk from Montgomery Station is less than 10 minutes. The BART was very safe and clean.ROOMS:Look nicer than they appear in the photos. They're quite dark which is why the photos dont do them justice. It's all very faux-Georgian but tastefully done. Bathrooms are classy too.Not enormous amounts of storage but enough. Avoid the mini-bar.SERVICE:Front-desk and doormen were superb. Extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.Room service was extremely punctual with the selectguest drinks delivery. (you book a 15 minute slot and they there on the button every time).A Maitre D at Bobs steakhouse (attached to the Omni) was a bit stuffy but thats not their problem. Remember its mainly business people eating or using the bar there so I would avoid.LOCATION:You're in the business district but this does mean the area is well served by espresso bars, jamba juice and diners for workers. Also, a tram stops outide the hotel which is handy.You can walk most places very easily or use your MUNI pass for the transport."
333,2131,"Mar 8 2007	Perfect location for Family vist to Chinese New Year	We were thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Omni. We had adjoining rooms (a King and a double) and were assistd at every turn by Omnii staff. We have stayed in more than a dozen hotels in S.F. (St. Francis, the Palace, the Milano, Hyatts, Mariott, Sir Francis Drake, Kensington Park etc.) over the years and this was definately among the best. Many hotels will have nice lobbies, but have very ordinary rooms . The Omni had beautifully furnished luxurious rooms with every imaginable amenitiy. I would recommend it to anyone. As San Francisco is developing more and more to the east of Union Square, restaurants, shopping and attractions are near the Financial District location of the Omni. Plus, the California Cable Car line is right outside. We were in S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade (a block away), Prom Dress Shopping, (5 min walk) and to attend an event at MoMA (10 minute walk). Nearby Belden Place offers some of San Franciscos best restaurants and a truly european bistro experience, that is entirely family friendly. We had dinner at Brindisi. Make reservations for weekends at any S.F. restaurant.. The hotel valet parking is $45 , high even for San Francisco. However, around the corner on Kearny is a 24 hour city parking lot with security. A bargain. If you join the Omni's &quot;club&quot; before your stay, you also get real pampering including morning coffee delivered to your door with the paper and free internet. We loved it!"
334,2131,"Mar 5 2007 	Great Service Great Hotel Great Stay!	We booked the Omni based on two factors: price for 2 rooms as given through Expedia and also reviews from Trip Advisor. This was a getaway weekend for me, 2 adult sisters, and our Mom to celebrate Mom's birthday.BACKGROUND: Each member of our gang is a very seasoned world traveler, and we have stayed in every type of accommodation around the world from the St. Regis and Four Seasons to camping in a tent on Kuaui, with many a &quot;hostel experience&quot; thrown in for good measure. We are also all veteran San Francisco travelers, with one sister having lived in the city at one time. We have stayed all over the city in all types of properties (large and small, cheap and luxury) and we ALL AGREE: The Omni gets our unanimous vote as our new San Francisco &quot;home away from home&quot;!!! From check in to check out, everything was smooth and wonderful and the staff, from the front desk to the housekeeping staff, could not have been nicer or more accommodating.FRONT DESK: We checked in on Friday and arrived quite early (10.30 a.m.) expecting to have to store our luggage until later in the day. Surprise! Two rooms were ready and waiting. However, upon getting up to the rooms, we discovered that we had one room with 2 doubles and one with 1 king. We wanted to have two rooms, both with doubles, connecting if possible. One call to the front desk, a thorough search of the computer, and VOILA: just what we wanted. Not only that, but the bellman brought up the keys to the new rooms so we did not even have to go downstairs again.The bellman made sure to get all of our luggage sorted out, gave us a run-down on the hotel's services, put himself at our complete disposal, and was just a friendly as he could be. It is clearly obvious that whomever is providing the customer service training for the staff is to be highly commended: not ONCE did we ever receive anything less that a gracious smile, a hello, and an offer to assist. We also requested a VERY late check out (3 p.m.) and were accommodated without a hitch.AMENITIES: the hotel has a great fitness center with lots of cardio options, headphones for the plasma screen individual TV units, and free bottled water. Also has reciprocity for the full scale fitness club located across the street.Guest rooms have blow dryers, good lighting in the bathroom and elsewhere in the room, full tub with shower, nice toiletries, robes, and an in-room safe. Lighted closet with lots of hangers, and minibar too. There is FREE high-speed interenet access in the room (hard wired) as well as a business center that offers free internet if you did not bring your own laptop. They will also print free pages for you if needed.....Also: the WINDOWS in the rooms open to allow for fresh air ventilation! We love this! The heating / ac unit if very quiet and powerful too. With the windows open there is some street noise (even at higher levels) but we didn't mind.BEDS: comfy, comfy, firm and soft at the same time, duvet comforters, with great pillow choice. Pillows are an issue with me &amp; I usually travel everywhere with my own to avoid vacation-ruining neck pain, but I left mine behind in the interest of packing light. I was not disappointed!THE AREA: The location of the hotel is downtown near the financial center, near the end of the California cable car line and the Montgomery Street BART station. It is very convenient if you are doing business in the area during the week, and much quieter if you stay on the weeknd as we did. Many of the close-by cafes and coffee shops close over the weekend. However, there are PLENTY within easy walking distance (within 10 block radius) that are open all weekend. You can walk to Union Square in one direction and the Ferry Plaza Marketplace in the other direction and be in either location within 10 minutes. Also: this is a SAFE walk and you will not pass by too many homeless (a problem in any large city, sadly).TRANSPORTATION: If you are uncomfortable or unable to walk, the hotel has Guest Cars (town cars) that will happily take you anywhere in the city you would like to go (or back to the airport when you leave, crying). The doorman will let you know the cost BEFORE you get in the car, and the price is comprable to taking a cab, and much cleaner. The front desk staff can direct you to and make reservations for you at any of the terrific SF restaurants. EATING: This is a city that runs on it's stomach. For morning (or afternoon) lattes &amp; cappucino, we would recommend a stroll through North Beach with a stop at &quot;CAFFE PUCCINI&quot; near the corner of Columbus &amp; Vallejo (next to Tratoria Pinnochio). Also, &quot;MOLINARI'S ITALIAN DELI&quot; (on Columbus) for sandwiches &amp; the Salami. They make their own &amp; are famous for it. For dinner &amp; lunch, we would happily recommend &quot;BOULEVARD&quot; (great location, fantastic food &amp; service, very pricey) as well as &quot;YANK SING&quot; (dim sum, extended lunch hours only, including weekends, great food, traditional cart serving, moderately pricey depending on your appetite, delicious).In addition, if you go over the weekend, you MUST go to the Saturday Morning Farmer's Market at the Ferry Plaza. This is not to be missed, and go hungry, as you will be able to eat everything from pastries to tamales, with coffee bars, cheese, fruits &amp; veggies. Definitely worth a stop an a beautiful weekend to get your picnic fixins on your way out to Angel Island, Alcatraz, or the Marina District or Golden Gate Park.Whew! Thanks for reading through to the end. I hope that if you stay at the Omni, you will be as pleased as we were. Have FUN!"
335,2131,"Feb 24 2007 	Great hotel good location	We stayed at the Omni for three nights in February. A very high quality hotel, located 5-10 mins cab ride from Union Square. Although its in the business district, and so the local area is really quiet / closed at the weekend, there are some really nice restaurants about 2 mins walk away - just ask at reception for recommendations. Rooms are lovely - very clean, spacious, big bed, very quiet etc.. Some great touches like free internet access in Business Centre, free hot chocolate by the lifts - the mark of a really customer orientated hotel.The only downside is the poor choice of healthy meals in the bar - but as there are some nice restaurants nearby not really a major problem.Much better value for a weekend stay than the hotels in the tourist traps at Fisherman's Wharf. Another TripAdvisor winner!"
336,2131,"Feb 18 2007	Heart of San Francisco	Our family of 3 adults stayed at the Omni for a long weekend last summer. The room was a good size for us with great amenities. As noted by other reviewers, the staff was very helpful. If returning to San Francisco, we would stay again."
337,2131,"Feb 16 2007 	Lovely Hotel	I've stayed at this hotel before, and there was a reason I returned. This time the valet guys weren't as attentive, and one of the guys actually slammed the door on me to help another guest, a total over sight on his part, but nonetheless, a little annoying since my roller bag got caught in the door, and I almost fell. But as soon as I entered the hotel, again your breath is taken away by the gorgeous, ornate lobby....really quite exquisite. The rooms are always quiet, clean and beautifully appointed. Only thing is if you stay during the weekend, there are not a lot of places walking distance to eat. Everything is closed on weekends since it is in the business district. However, we did find some, If you want a real unique lunch, definitely try out the over 150 yr old establishment called the Tadich Grill...great food, and all the waiters are all men over 45/50 yrs. who wear white coats, and who are very entertaining. For lunch they have a $11 minimum per person. Another top restaurant is Aqua, walking distance, but make reservations early, and you are looking at a $75/pp prefixe menu, but this place is a rage right now."
338,2131,"Feb 13 2007 	Beautiful luxury no complaints	What a beautiful hotel... It was in the perfect location (4 blocks from BART, short walk from Union Square and Westfield/SF Centre), but reasonably quiet and not crowded with the usual tourist throngs.The check-in process was seamless and cheerful, and the door staff was pleasant and helpful.If you're thoughtless enough to have brought a car, as I did, be warned that valet parking is expensive (we were charged $45/day plus city tax) and the nearby garages were full on a weekday afternoon. To their credit, the staffers were upfront about the price and didn't charge us extra, even though we left the car there for more than 24 hours.The room was well-appointed and luxurious, with a nice, clean bathroom, bathrobes and linens. One minor complaint we had was the quality of the bedding... my mattress was sagging on one side, and my friend's pillows were very &quot;lumpy.&quot; The mattresses and pillows seemed to be in need of replacement, in general. But it wasn't bad enough for us to switch rooms or ask for new pillows. We might've been upset if we had to pay a lot (say $250+/night) for our stay, but we got a deal, so... just something to keep in mind if you're expecting pure perfection and paying rack rates. In all, we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely recommend it and stay here again if the price is right next time."
339,2131,"Feb 12 2007	Small for three	My family (three adults) stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Although we reserved a quadruple 2 double bed room, the room was very small and just twin room. The bed was only two single beds. Moreover the room was third floor and aside ballroom, and thus very noisy. MN (JAPAN)"
340,2131,"Jan 27 2007 	Magnificent and Wonderful ...	An absolute gem! 4-Star, 1st Class Wonderful Hotel !! Superb staff with friendly royal welcome and greetings, each and every time we entered or exited hotel ...and we were not even royalty !! The service was world class, in very well-appointed rooms. Rooms were of classic decor...spotless and pristine, with comfortable bed, robes, in-room safe, nice toiletries, and ample lighting. The location is quiet at nite, given near financial district, but still very convenient via walk, cab, or even famous cable-car right in front, to anywhere in SF !!! All requests made with the hotel were met without hesitation and perfection by the obviously well-trained, friendly staff. Must stay here when in town !!!"
341,2131,"Jan 21 2007 	Wonderful experience at the Omni	We just returned from a two night weekend stay at the Omni. We stayed there based upon TripAdvisor reviews and couldn't have been happier. Everything was as expected and more. From the attentive, friendly service of the staff to the comfortable, clean room, it was all perfect. We signed up for the Select Guest program when we arrived and had free coffee and newspaper delivered to our room at the time we requested. This was a really nice extra touch. The hotel is in a great location to walk to most of the main attractions in downtown San Francisco. We will definitely stay at the Omni again when we return to San Francisco."
342,2131,"Jan 19 2007 	Great Time at Omni in San Francisco	My husband and I stayed at the Omni in San Fran on 12/25 and 12/31 (spent time in wine country in between), and we had a lovely time. We purchased the Wrap Yourself in Luxury package which included free valet parking, 2 glasses of champagne at the bar, and a discount coupon for Macy's. We also used an upgrade coupon that we received for being Select Guests, so we upgraded to a bay view room on the very top floor. We have always found the Select Guest program to be very beneficial. As we were getting ready to go out for New Years Eve, there was a knock at the door. The Omni had sent us a bottle of champagne on ice, accompanied by 6 large chocolate-covered strawberries. What a nice surprise. My husband and I haved stayed in several Omni hotels, for both business and personal travel and we've never been disappointed by the accommodations or staff. We will definitely stay at the Omni in San Francisco again. Great hotel, attentive staff, and convenient location."
343,2131,"Jan 7 2007 	Omni style and service!	We spent two nights at the Omni after Christmas. Having stayed at the Omni San Diego, I was curious to see if the San Francisco hotel was deserving of its #1 rating by TripAdvisor reviewers. I booked directly through the Omni website and the $199 Park and Play offer included parking and a superior room. Having paid approximately $48 a night for parking at a hotel in the Union Square area, this seemed a great deal. As a Select Guest, registration info is on file and so you basically walk up to the desk and receive your room card. I had requested and received a front-facing (California St) room on a high floor. The lobby area was beautifully decorated and complimentary hot cider and cookies were available. The bed was extremely comfortable, as was the large armchair with ottoman. The room is tastefully decorated with a large work desk, many lamps, Bose radio and armoire with television/coffee service/mini-bar and large drawers for clothing. The large closet has a safe and bathrobes. The bathroom was large with a huge shower/tub with great water pressure. Large make-up mirror, too. As mentioned, Select Guest program will get you beverages and a newspaper, delivered at the time you designate. Some breakfast items offered to SGs at $2-4 such as bagels, muffins or breakfast burrito. Great prices! More extensive menu available through room service. This is one of the few hotels that delivers a large carafe of coffee if that is your selected beverage. Bagels come toasted, wrapped in a cloth napkin and with cream cheese and an assortment of fruit preserves. The steakhouse restaurant has very good food- a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches were on lunch menu. Prices a bit high but not out of line for SF restaurants. Staff very attentive. Hotel very quiet but the city, and Financial District in particular, have a low occupancy rate during the holiday period. This hotel is an excellent choice for business travellers."
344,2131,"Jan 5 2007 	Omni shmomni...	My family and I visited S.F. 12/27-12/30 and stayed at the Omni. We requested a roll-a-way bed and were given an inflatable bed. We stayed in the &quot;signature&quot; room which was suposed to have upgraded furnishings and amenities (for an upgraded price). I called the hotel directly three times to confirm and to make sure our requests of a king bed and roll-a-way bed were received. We thought it might be cleaner than the &quot;deluxe &quot; room we stayed in on a previous visit. It was not. The carpet was stained in several places and the furniture needs refurbishing. The light fixtures in the bathroom were still caked with dust.The mgr. could not understand why an inflatable bed was unaccepatble, but moved us to a &quot;mini suite&quot; after much effort(two hours of back and forth-you know). This room was long and narrow with one small window. It was dirty and dreary and had a bowl of rotten fruit in a silver bowl waiting for us. The bathroom was even worse. It had no tub,just a huge, mildewed and cracked shower with a weird wooden bench and bars everywhere. When I called the mgr. to tell her this was not ok she told me this was the &quot;handicap&quot; suite and all she had. It did have a &quot;kingsize&quot; sofa bed in it with dirty, musty linens on it. We took this over the inflatable bed but we were not happy.The doormen are very aggressive and have never turned down a tip for us..Also, do not join &quot;select guest&quot;. I did and I also called them to confirm our reservation and got nothing that I could see. I think there have been some fake reviews here...Hmm..."
345,2131,"Jan 3 2007 	The Omni Gets It Right	My 3-day New Year's getaway at the Omni SF reconfirmed my committment to this luxury hotel chain. I booked a 2-night stay via Expedia at an incredible rate, about $120 per night. I normally opt for affordablility over luxury, but sometimes you just want to be pampered and are willing to pay a little bit more. For those occasions, you can't go wrong with Omni. They understand the what a true luxury hotel experience is all about. At Omni, the customer is always right, and the customer's needs always come first. Case in point- my room key did not work upon check-in (they had given me a room that was still occupied, oops), and when I returned to the front desk, they upgraded me to a 2-room corner suite for my trouble, apologizing all the while. This was followed up with a personal note of apology from the front desk manager the next morning - and a fresh fruit basket in the afternoon, again gratis. The suite (room 920) was gorgeous, with a sitting room, 2 flat-screen TVs, and a DVD player. One of the nice things about staying in the Financial District is that it's very quiet at night - no sirens, ambulances, etc.I joined the Select Guest program several years ago. As others have noted, I highly recommended joining for the free perks. I enjoyed the complimentary beverages (choice of 2 - try the coffee and hot chocolate together!) and morning paper, and was pleasantly suprised to find that this Omni also offered Select Guests a range of reduced-price breakfast items along with the complimentary morning beverages. For $3.75 each, we ordered the breakfast burritos, which were hefty and delicious, served with fresh salsa. Imagine - a delicious room-service breakfast in SF for under $5! I stll can't quite understand how this place made money off my stay....I guess it all averages out in their favor. Stay here, you'll be glad you did."
346,2131,"Jan 2 2007 	good choice	Omni was a solid choice. Clean relatively spacious room. Upgraded to a &quot;signature&quot; room. Price was right for San Fran over new years. Wlaking distance to Chinatown, North Beach/Little Italy.A cable car runs in front of hotel up to Van Ness where there is a good movie theatre. Highlight of trip was walking tour of San Fran from Chinatown Alleyway Tours. They have a website and you book online. Also, if you like bookstores, City Lights is a must along with the new Cody's bookstore by Market St.Back to the hotel, a good choice/location, but nothing &quot;fancy&quot;.Note: Cab from SFO airport should be about $35 to $40. Avoid the SuperShuttle unless you want to visit all the hotels in Union Sq."
347,2131,Jan 2 2007	Great stay at the Omni	My family (4 of us including 2 teenagers) just spent 3 nights at the Omni. We really enjoyed the location--not among the throngs of tourists in Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf--between Chinatown and North Beach and minutes from the Ferry Building and all that it has to offer. The service at the Omni was extraordinary. Everyone was extremely helpful and kind. The room was nice--but not exceptional in anyway. I would definately stay here again based on the location and service.
348,2131,"Dec 29 2006 	Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommended	As usual, I left everything to the last minute and booked this hotel the day before I was due to stay. I got a really good deal on it (about 100 per night), I was a bit worried about the quality of the hotel, but it was the only decent one available. I was 100% pleased with this hotel. The rooms are very spacious and decorated very neutrally, really nice and relaxing. I booked a twin room with 2 queen sized beds. Staff are really nice, very willing to help. The hotel is on California street, only 10ish minute walk to union square and only a couple of blocks away from China Town. The Tram line runs directly out the front of the building so you can hop on and go to Fisherman's Wharf. Every evening when we returned to the hotel, room service turned down our beds, put relaxing music on the television and put a little Chocolate on our pillows that said &quot;each day must end with a reward&quot; (something along those lines). I couldnt have had a better stay in San Francisco and I couldnt recommend this hotel enough. I stayed in the Marriott for a few nights and the Omni beats it hands down."
349,2131,"Dec 26 2006 	Most pleasant hotel stay in years!	I visit SF often and, in the past, have stayed in inexpensive hotels on the premise that &quot;it's just a place to sleep&quot;. I've always felt that I'd rather spend my hard-earned money on something more important than a hotel room (e.g. a nice meal or a theater ticket).It was Christmas night and the Omni offered a deal that was too exceptional to pass up. For about double the price of the lowest category &quot;El Dumpo&quot; (including tax), I decided to treat myself to the Omni.The glowing reviews are well-deserved. The hotel, rooms and staff lacked NOTHING. Everything was sparkling clean, the service was friendly and efficient. Replacement batteries for a remote control arrived within 15 minutes of my call. The room-service breakfast arrived punctally and hot. Free internet in the lobby and a daily newspaper on your door. Gorgeous bath with everything you could want (including cotton balls, Qtips and sewing kit). Iron, umbrella and robes in the closet. Turn-down service. All in-room electronic amenities. Get the picture? Absolutely no negatives! As long as I can get a weekend rate near the one I just enjoyed, I'll never stay elsewhere again in SF."
350,2131,"Dec 10 2006 	Wonderful Stay At The Omni	We stayed at the Omni San Francisco over the Thanks Giving Holiday Weekend period and had a fabulous time. The service was faultless from our initial registration to the end of our stay. We were fortunate enough to receive an upgrade through the Select Guest Membership Scheme from a Deluxe Room to a Mini Suite which was fantastic.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the housekeeping was exceptional, I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel and as an aside, it is well worth taking the time to join the Select Guest Membership Programme."
1,2140,"Nov 25 2009 	Loved this hotel	Stayed here for 3 nights and was sad to leave!The staff in the hotel were extremely friendly and service was fantastic! paid extra to stay on the &quot;club&quot; level and it was well and truely worth it! The evening cocktail reception was fabulous, a fantastic opportunity to meet people and have a chat after a long day of sight seeing! The waiter in the Club lounge was probably one of the most charismatic people we came across in the US and he well and truly earned his tip each afternoon. By day two he had memorised our names and where we were from and told everyone that he spoke to!!! Would stay here again fo sure!"
2,2140,"Nov 25 2009 	Excellent location great if you have a Club Room	Really enojoyed 3 nights here in October. The location of the hotel is great, just a minute or so walk from Union Square. The room wasn't the most spacious that I have ever stayed in, but certainly not the smallest either. The furnishings were of a good standard and the room was cleaned daily.We had a club room which includes free drinks and nibbles from 4.30 - 6.30 each day and made full use of them! The barman was very friendly and we spoke to several other guests and picked up various tips on things to do and places to visit.The concierge was very helpful and made several bookings for us. We got a good deal on this hotel and enjoyed our stay tremendously."
3,2140,"Nov 20 2009 	In the centre of it all but needs spiffin up!	We booked the Prescott through our agent as a four star hotel. I would agree with that rating only for the location of this hotel- Union Square could not be closer. But the room we were given could have used some refurbishing- wallpaper peeling away, carpet seems old and musty, paint could have been done by a 10 year old. The awkward angles in the bathroom left me with bruises on my elbows while trying to dry my hair. We were on the third floor, and the street noises were relatively loud (as well as a rocking party in the private club across the street on Saturday night) but as I always travel with ear plugs this was not an issue- if you are a light sleeper this would be irritating. Our last night we ordered some late room service, and the one thing that I specified- I could have no sesame seeds on my hamburger bun, (which the lady checked with the kitchen when she took my order and assured me there were none on the buns tonite) and when my meal arrived- I was scraping sesame seeds off- too tired and hungry to send it back! The service from the front desk and especially Lane as Concierge brought the hotel back up to standards for us. The inclusion of the breakfast buffet ensured that we kick started our days with fresh fruit, bagels and coffee. Free WiFi when you join Klimpton on line. We love San Francisco, but I would explore other hotel options for our next visit. It is not worthy of four stars. Note: See Wicked if you have the chance! It was a highlight for us!!"
4,2140,"Nov 18 2009 	cute hotel	area- nice in the day time. at night, the feel is totally different. doesn't feel safe anymore. we took a cab from the airport. on the way back, we took the BART- was very convenient and close to the hotel (but there were some delays on the BART so leave early).hotel- feels worn, but cozy. we stayed on the 6th fl, club room level and had to change to a diff elevator bank. some of the floors are like a maze, but we got the hang of it. the room was not very spacious, but worked for it. the windows open pretty wide. that was nice for us since we liked the breeze, but may not be so good for everyone, esp young kids. the room was clean. the beds, confortable. breakfast came w/ the room, which was nice even though there was nothing hot. our floor was very quiet, we could not hear any one else on the floor."
5,2140,"Oct 21 2009	The Location Was Great But ...	...the room was teeny, tiny (2 queen beds stuffed into a 250 sq. ft. room). Seriously, walking from the bed by the window required a squeeze by the other bed, it's that small. Perhaps a better choice would have been two double beds, or paying extra for another level.The furnishings, wallpaper etc also looked kind of tired.On the plus side, the location can't be beat (we saw &quot;Wicked&quot; at the Orpheum, a $5 cab ride and went to the King Tut exhibit at the deYoung in Golden Gate Park, a $17 cab ride), just a few blocks off Union Square.And for the $150 we paid (plus tax), not too shabby overall. Still, the modern hotels surrounding it would have been a better choice, as much as I like the Klimpton chain and patronizing other than the corporate box-type lodgings."
6,2140,"Oct 16 2009 	Enjoy the wine reception each evening	All hotels in San Francisco seem to be small in the downtown area so taking this in to consideration this hotel was a great choiceBreakfast and wine reception each evening was includedA great spot for wandering around the shops as well as catching the cable car to Fishermans WharfThe staff were very helpful especially our waiter in the Club section, an extremely friendly and considerate person."
7,2140,"Oct 15 2009 	classic comfort	My wife and I stayed at the Prescott for a week in November. Although the entance vestibule is modest, there is an air of sopfistication about the place, particularly the 'Club' levels. Initially we were installed at the front, where there was a good deal of traffic noise, but had no difficulty in transferring to a quieter, larger room, albeit one with no view.The staff were exceptionally friendly and obliging and made several telephone calls free of charge on our behalf. The room was always perfectly cleaned and the public rooms were comfortably furnished. There is an open fire in the lounge, where complimentary wine is served every afternoon at 5.00.The gym is small, but adequate, accessible via the club area which is very stylish, a cocoon of comfort.The hotel is only two blocks from Union Square, so well placed for shops and transport in this fantastic and wonderful city."
8,2140,"Oct 14 2009	So much to see in San Francisco	We just returned from a 4 day weekend in San Francisco and I don't know where to begin. The Prescott Hotel was decent. The staff is definitely helpful but the room is small. Coffee and tea are served from 6 am until 9:30 am and wine is served from 5-6 in the hotel lobby. The location is great - a block to all the great shopping that Union Square offers. Great sushi restaurants, cafes, bars and restaurants can be found in the blocks surrounding the hotel. We took a tour of Sonoma and Muir Woods with Extranomical Tours on Friday. You will only spend an hour in Muir Woods but according to my sister - If you have seen one redwood you have seen them all. The tour stops at three wineries and a cafe for lunch. In order to pack in all the wineries you only stay for about 45 minutes at each winery. You have enough time for tastings, photos and a quick walk around the grounds. The wineries do not provide a tour of the grounds nor do you see anything about how the wine is made. It' great if you are only there for a few days like we were and are trying to fit everything in. We hit all the tourist spots - the Cannery, Ghiradelli Square, the Wharf, a streetcar, a cablecar, the Haight and Alamo Square. I recommend the $11 one day all you can ride pass or the $18 three day pass for public transportation. Two cablecar and one bus ride and the pass will pay for itself."
9,2140,"Oct 7 2009 	Good Hotel	Myself and some friends stayed at the hotel recently October 09. When we arrived after a long flight we were greated with smiles from the reception staff and were very helpful in explaining everything. The room was clean and tidy. The resteraunt staff were helpful, chaty and the food was excellent. The location of the hotel is near to the shops and other areas of interest. Only one fault outside my window there were fans blowing all night and day it sounded like you were constantly in an plane."
10,2140,"Oct 7 2009 	Thoroughly enjoyable 5 night stay in Downtown SF.	Stayed 5 nights in early September. Great location, only 5 mins walk to Union Sq. &amp; 10 mins gentle downhill to Market/Powell station. We took the BART train from the airport (recommend this) &amp; had a 15min walk up Powell &amp; along Post to hotel. No problem. Relax when you see the Donnatello Hotel! Staff were very helpful &amp; attentive, particularly front desk &amp; internet engineer. He arrived at our room after only 8 mins &amp; sorted our internet access problem staight away. More than adequate Continental breakfast spread with lots of fresh fruit. Sets you up for the day. It's worthwhile going Club class for the Happy 'Hour'. Great way to unwind after a day sightseeing. Meant to be 4.30-6pm but fortunately tended to overrun as we usually arrived about 5.30 after a full day in the city. Hints to leave were very subtle. Met some really nice folk from all over the world, picked up a few tips about other places we were going to visit. Our room was a bit small but very comfortable. Spent 3 nights in another cheaper hotel nearby later on &amp; appreciated the difference. We would DEFINITELY go back to the Prescott.."
11,2140,"Oct 6 2009 	Great Location 	I had a comfortable 3 night stay. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The location is one block from Union Square and a main trolley line. Easy walking distance to China Town, Convention Center, etc. The room was comfortable and clean, but small. Overall the place is a bit worn and needs a refresh. Worn out carpet, stained bath curtain, tiny pillows, 19&quot; TV, no in-room coffee - all things that could be updated. I had dinner a couple of times and found the found to be good (not great, but good). My other issue is noise - I was on the second floor overlooking Post, and the street noise was horrible. I should have changed rooms, but...never got around to it. Overall, I'd stay here again if the price was right."
12,2140,"Oct 5 2009 	Highly satisfactory	This was a good value hotel with great staff, good rooms and a brilliant location. I think it was everything you'd want for your money and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco. Great location near Union Square and a stones throw away from good bars and shops. It really was a good base from which to go anywhere on foot or by public transport. Very friendly staff and a good clean, relatively spacious room. I think it lived up to expectations and represented good value for money. We had a very pleasant stay here."
13,2140,"Sep 30 2009 	Lovely boutique hotel w great service!	My boyfriend &amp; I stayed at the Prescott for 5 nights in September. Throughout, the most amazing thing was the service: We had a minor problem with the cold water, and called down to the desk. It was fixed in literally 15 minutes. The concierge printed our return boarding passes for us in 2 min. with no charge (the Nikko 4 yrs ago wanted $12). Throughout, the staff was very pleasant and attentive to our needs. And more....The room was not huge but big enough. It was nicely appointed and cozy and clearly recently redecorated. The bathroom was lovely. All in all, an excellent hotel. Only two cautions: since this is a small &amp; only 7-story hotel, there is no &quot;view&quot;--just the buildings across the street. I did miss that. Also, for the elderly or infirm--there is absolutely NOTHING to hold onto when in the shower, and the tub floor was a bit slippery. But other than that--A+++++!!!"
14,2140,"Sep 29 2009 	Not bad	The hotel is at a good location, it looks very old, but very clean, the rooms are very small but clean, the toilets are very clean and well maintained. The Internet service was free since i registered for the Kimpton membership. There is no lobby for the hotel but the service of the people is exceptional. The response is prompt, professional and polite. The staff is very helpful and courteous. The food is good , but the options of complimentary breakfast is few.The hotel needs to modernize, and revamp the rooms, and maintain the service standards"
15,2140,"Sep 23 2009 	Very satisfied with club level at the Prescott	Two couples spent 3 nights at the club level rooms at the Prescott. We were in 422 and 426, both Queen rooms overlooking Post St and steps from the club room/wine reception. The rooms were fine, enough room, medium sized baths with shower tub combos. Windows open for those who like to look out on the street and get a bit of a breeze. We had flat screen tv in an armoire. One room had a faulty remote/tv which was replaced the next day after informing the front desk. The rooms were clean and had standard mini bar, iron, robes.We used the club room twice for the evening reception 4:30 to 6:30 pm. We had wine, champagne, and cocktails along with 3 cheese choices, pizzas from Postrio, and bread. Food was good and replendished often.Our Kimpton air/hotel rate included breakfast downstairs in part of Postrio. One side of the room had the cereal, pastries, bagels, juice, coffee, etc. Be sure to check the other side of the breakfast room for the eggs, potatoes, bacon, etc...it wasn't obvious that these were available.There were cookies on a plate at the front desk in the afternoon when we stopped in after touring all day.We received the New York Times daily at our door and on Sunday morning the SF Chronical was available in the Postrio breakfast room. We were very satisfied with the entire experience."
16,2140,"Sep 4 2009 	Great location very helpful staff and a good hotel	This hotel is right in the downtown area of SF close by Union Square. The rooms are quiet, a good size, well equipped, and very well serviced. The staff were able to help me find places to eat very well (i am a vegan), and were generally very knowledgable and helpful.The breakfast was good - but try and avoid those French people elbowing their way towards the pastries!! :-)"
17,2140,"Sep 2 2009 	Great value for money execellent location	The location of this hotel was very covenient. Although the hotel is a bit old, the atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming, we got a good rate and spent there 3 nights. The service was outstanding, and the concierge was very helpful when we needed some assistance with car rental."
18,2140,"Aug 31 2009 	Great for the price but disappointment for a Kimpton	I've stayed in several Kimpton properties, and this one has been the most disappointing. Let me preface my thoughts first: I got upgraded to a King Suite and only paid $150/night, which is a deal in SF and I would have been prepared for $300+ for a Kimpton.Let's start with the positives, considering the great rate I paid:- large room- very comfy bed- very central location- quiet room- stayed on the Club Level, and the bartender and food at the cocktail reception were very attentive and tasty, respectively- typical Kimpton, as-in a old hotel that's been modernized yet maintains some old-hotel charmsThe things that disappoint me about this Kimpton, compared to the others:- what happened to the turn-down service?- rooms have noticeable wear-and-tear -- including the scary white-ish spots on the sofa- mini bar is simply a cheap fridge where the bottles are tossed in and no organization- a/c was sporadic. The other couple in our party complained theirs never worked well (which concurs with other reviews posted recently)- half the windows will close, but not lock. Two were open when I arrived, so we had a couple flies that had to die an untimely death via NYTimes-smashing- the Club-Level &quot;free&quot; breakfast was basic. Cereal, pastries, coffee and fruit. Any proteins or hot items must be purchased at typical big-city prices.Long of the short, I'd probably stay here again if I could get the same rate. However, if there are no upgrades/refurbishments and rate is $200+, I'd probably give another hotel a chance first.PS. Want free wifi? Simply joint Kimpton's rewards program. It's free, and they don't pester you with emails. Fair trade, in my opinion."
19,2140,"Aug 21 2009 	Good location small room broken air conditioning poor service	Our room was in the &quot;anex&quot;, meaning we had to take the elevator to the 4th floor, get off, go down the hall, around the lounge, get on another elevator and go up to the 7th floor. Not a lot of fun getting the comp coffee from the lobby in the morning. Our A/C stopped working and our room was 78 degrees. The service man said it was on time delay and left. 30 minutes later (and now 80 degrees) we called again. This time he drained a pipe in the ceiling and the air came back on. Same thing 2 days later, and no air again the morning we checked out! So, on a 4 night stay we had no air 3 times. SF was having a bit of a heat wave during our visit, so no air was not an option! We won't stay here again."
20,2140,"Aug 10 2009 	Relaxing 5 day saty	Room was clean. Front desk very helpful. We had a suite so we had a lot of room. The only down sides were that they ran out food at the breakfast one morning. Also, we left our room one day at 8am and came back at 2:30 and the cleaning lady arrived at the door to clean the room just as we got back.We had a summer special so the rates were great.The wine hour was very enjoyable and we were able to meet new people. We had a newspaper by our door every morning. We paid for the package deal which included breakfast and it was well worth it. They offered a great spread for breakfast.We were there for a wedding nearby so we stayed 5 nights and we were very comfortable. The room was away from the elevators &amp; was very quiet.The location was terrific. Only a block from Union Square.We had dinner in their restaurant one night and the food and service was very good.Kimptons are known to be small hotels so don't stay there if you are looking for something large.We would stay here again."
21,2140,"Aug 10 2009 	Decent but not the best of Kimpton.	I was excited because we got a 20th Anniversary package at the Kimpton website that included a club level suite with breakfast and a $50 voucher for Postrio, Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in the lobby. The room was the largest we've seen in San Francisco and cost slightly less than other hotels in the area but it was tired looking, the furniture was scuffed and some of the wallpaper was peeling. The club level came with a 2 hour cocktail reception instead of the standard Kimpton wine reception but was just kind of chaotic, not as well managed as the wine receptions usually are. There was a decent selection of alcohol but too many people for the 1 bartender/attendant. Postrio had a limited menu because they are remodeling but we got room service for dinner and it was disappointing to say the least. Probably our least favorite meal of everything in San Francisco. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the rate was good, but there are definitely better options."
22,2140,"Aug 3 2009 	Terrible Tired and Smelly	We had a terrible experience at the Prescott -- and we didn't even stay there! It was so bad that we checked out before we checked in. We reserved 6 nights there for a convention nearby. We called from the airport to tell them we were arriving and see if they could have a room ready for us. When we arrived, we were told it would be approx. an hour before the room was ready. When they showed us to the room, it was so smelly and stunk so badly that the bellman called the front desk immediately and asked for another room. We went back to the Club Lounge to catch up on some work and wait for another room. We were told it would take approximately an hour. Four hours later, we were still sitting there. No one had come to check on us, offer us water or snacks, or update us on the status of the room. Meanwhile, other people were checking in and the staff was constantly rolling furniture and carts up and down the hall and making tons of noise. When they finally took us to the new room, this one smelled too. It was obvious that they had sprayed chemicals or air freshener to cover up odors. The entire hotel looked shabby and worn and smelled terrible. On the positive side, the front desk staff was very accommodating when we asked to check out and be released from our reservation. The front desk person obviously understood what the problem was and said &quot;we'll be doing a renovation soon.&quot; We fled to the Nikko where we were treated exceptionally well and given a clean, comfortable, and nice smelling room."
23,2140,Aug 2 2009 	Hotel in Decline	Poor service from staff that did not care. The hotel's premier restaurant is not a &quot;cafe&quot; there was not follow up and I was constally calling the front desk for things like the bottle of champagne that that came with our package and the dessert that the waiter forgot but charged us for and on and on. It became tiresome. The room was very small and when I asked if there were any larger they never got back to me. I hope all the Kimpton Hotels are not sliding like this one but I am wary.
24,2140,"Aug 1 2009 	Great value for a perfect location	I would definitely recommend this hotel for its great location right next to Union Square and its sober look. Rooms are a bit old style but neat and we had nothing to complain about the bathroom, which was clean.Continental breakfast was generous and the staff was kind.The main drawback is the lack of complimentary wireless, which left us quite disappointed."
25,2140,"Jul 31 2009 	Poor service from front desk staff	The front desk staff was hacking into the computers to view utube ? It was very funny until we found out that the message we left for our client was misplace.We never heard from the hotel manager or anyone else.Nice Hotel but can't recommend to business traveler.Restaurant was fantastic! Very Famous Chef ! Poor WiFi3 calls before someone picks up. Same problem 3 nights in a row.Housekeeping,bellmen and doormen very nice and made us feel at home."
26,2140,Jul 23 2009 	Bathrooms Not So Clean	I have stayed in a number of Kimpton hotels and would rank this as the worst by far. Our room was quite small. The bathroom had significant amounts of black mold or something dirty in the grout that was so bad that I took pictures of it. We had reservations to come back to this hotel at the end of our travels in the Bay Area and ended up moving to another hotel because we really did not like the Prescott. The service at the hotel was okay but not fantastic.
27,2140,"Jul 18 2009 	Fantastic Service	My husband and I traveled to SF for a wedding. We have stayed in other Kimpton hotels in SF and decided to try the Prescott due to the low price we found through an alternative website. We paid $101 plus tax. Total was a little under $120 for the night. We requested to check in early and were granted a 2:00pm check-in, as well as a late check-out until 1:00pm. The staff were great in providing information to the SFMOMA, directions to the Golden Gate Bridge and printing our boarding passes for our flights. The negatives were not huge for me. It's $45 for valet parking, but it is SF and that is pretty typical. The rooms are small, but that is typical for a Kimpton hotel."
28,2140,"Jul 9 2009 	Immaculate rooms friendly staff and an ideal location.	From the second I arrived at the doors of the Prescott Hotel, I knew I had made the right choice. Welcomed in by a friendly doorman, our check-in was then handled quickly and efficiently, and although we were offered additional items for our stay, this was not done in a pushy manner. Our room was spacious, with plenty of drawer and wardrobe space. Every morning upon leaving our room we were greeted with a smile from the staff, as well as a daily paper.The hotel itself is perfectly located. A short stroll from Union Square and Market Street means shopping is less than five minutes away, and at the end of the block one can jump on the trolley car and be whisked off to Fisherman's Wharf in style.This hotel is a romantic haven - so much so that my partner proposed to me in our room on our second night here. If you're looking for a hotel that has it all, please look no further!"
29,2140,"Jul 9 2009 	Great service- Rooms a let down	Hotel entrance and service from front desk was outstanding, loction was brilliant, then we got to our room. It was dull, lifeless with old dark furniture. bed was ok but you got the impression that the room was only cleaned in the places you could see. Down the side of the bedside table in between the bed it was thick of dust on the skirting boards, only noticed as i dropped a coin down there. Also you can hear all the other guests in their rooms, i suppose its is due to the age of the hotel and that several buildings have been knocked together, the floors creaked and the windows are old sash windows don't stop any noise outside. Could really benefit from double glazing.The restaraunt Postrio was closed for refurbishment, so ate in the bar area but food was expensive with average quality.Overall, there were much better hotels in the area with better standard of room, would not stay here again."
30,2140,"Jun 25 2009 	Tasteful remodeled historic Hotel with modern amenities	I loved it - Tasteful remodeled historic Hotel with modern amenities. We spent 3 nights at the Prescott were was very impressed.Beautiful furnished big room with Heavenly Kingbed &amp; a nice, huge Bath room.The Front desk personal was very friendly and helpful.Be sure to go for dinner in the Restaurant from Wolfgang Puck, we was lucky to met him self. The Food was incredible."
31,2140,"Jun 22 2009 	Our experience was a little different......	Small room, smaller bathroom, shabby decor, lots of corridor noise. Big problem over free/not free breakfast: most unpleasant. We'll go elsewhere next trip."
32,2140,"Jun 22 2009 	Not for disabled.	The Prescott provides (for an extra charge) a delightful cocktail hour and good breakfast. Concierge was helpful, location very good. The restaurant had good food but was overpriced with small portions. The room was small and had a view of a brick wall. We reserved a handicapped room at the Hotel Prescott and were told a wheelchair would await us. Upon arrival there was no wheelchair. Two elevators with a long walk in between were needed to get to our room. Three elevators needed to get to breakfast. The bath had no walk-in shower.Upon checkout the elevator did not work and we were forced to use the stairs which was difficult with luggage and a walker. Although the hotel was advised a disabled individual was checking in we were not advised of the considerable difficulties of getting around in the hotel with the multiple elevators and no walk-in shower and we would never had reserved had we known this. I reported all this to the front desk but got no response."
33,2140,Jun 14 2009 	Excellent concierge high-performing staff great location for Union Square	Concierge is totally up with local restaurant scene. Hotel building is a bit old and creaky but my inside room on the sixth floor was quiet and comfortable.
34,2140,"Jun 13 2009 	Avoid the regular rooms spend extra for the Club level	I've stayed in a lot of Kimptons, and this one ranks near the bottom. The other Kimptons in the area, and several other hotels, are generally better. Nothing was terribly wrong, but the same ho-hum experience could have been had at a $60, anonymous hotel. I was in their regular queen room, an I believe the experience would have been much better if I'd stayed in the Club level. Maybe that's where the 4 stars kick in. The rest of the hotel is barely 3 star.The best thing about the hotel was the location, close to garages, transport and restaurants. And the front desk staff were courteous and informative. The room had a strange narrow layout - forget about watching tv from the bed. The cheap armoire is to the side of the bed, and the tv is tiny, set high up. The window looked out onto dingy sides of other buildings. Despite the cleanliness, the overall ambience was vaguely depressing.They continue advertising a lot of things that they apparently no longer offer, such as turndown service, and l'Occitane products (apparently reserved for Club guests). Regular rooms get Aveda shampoom conditioner and soap - that's it. You probably won't have robes in your room, but they'll probably send them up.I believe they provide free wireless internet to their loyalty program members only. It's an easy matter to sign up."
35,2140,Jun 12 2009 	Lovely boutiquie hotel - excellent service	I was attending a seminar in the city and decided to stay overnight. The location was central to where my meetings were and the local restaurants recommended by the staff surpassed my expectations.The evening cocktail reception was a pleasant way to end a hctic day. While there I met some fellow travellers who shared their experiences. They too were very happy.
36,2140,"Jun 11 2009 	Great hotel awesome location and charming staff	Well, after reading the other reviews I was really worried about booking, however, booked it on TZOO, for $99.oo nad then upgraded to club level for another 30, well, I must say we got a steal, the club level had an open bar including my favorite California &quot;Champagne&quot; and an awesome cheese &quot;bar&quot; and served hot pizza and it included each morning a bountiful continental breakfast. The location was awesome. In the heart of the financial district, blocks away from far more than we could ever dream of doing. The staff was polite and accomidating, you can tell with the economic downturn like every other company they have had to cut back, but, everyone tried their best to make up for it. We were lucky our room was actually quite nice and not as small as we thought, I will mention that yes it is an older hotel, that adds to the charm. Would stay here again at the right price."
37,2140,"Jun 7 2009 	A great value	First class service and accommodations. I've stayed at San Franisco hotels at twice the price and half the value. Almost every luxury and convenience is provided (we could have used a coffee maker in the room). Not much view but excellent location near cable cars, BART, Union Square. Could do wireless Internet right in room. Nice breakfast. Morning newspaper at door. Will happily return. . ."
38,2140,"Jun 2 2009 	Wouldn't stay again	I stayed at the Prescott Hotel last weekend with my sister and niece, and was not impressed with the hotel. The rooms were dark and small and the carpet was dirty. The view was awful as it looked out into the windows of the next door building. I was staying in a king suite with a pull out sofa, as we wanted adjoining rooms and they didn't have any. I was told the sofa bed was comfortable and there was a door between the two rooms. The door was a shutter and the sofa bed was so thin and uncomfortable I could not sleep on it. I notified the front desk and they said they would check on other rooms, but they never did. The phone in the room didn't work and the jacuzzi tub did not work. The food was over priced for the quality in the restaurant downstairs. The staff was not friendly and basically uninterested. I asked four times for pillows and bedding for the sofa bed, and finally got them after 9:30 pm. The bedding on the sofa bed looked as though it hadn't been washed in a long time. All in all the room was very unappealing and dark. I paid $15 to use the internet to print my boarding passes and the server was down. The hotel clerk said she wouldn't charge me the $15, but I received an email showing I was billed for it. The whole hotel could use a deep cleaning, including the elevator and all the carpet. I would not stay there again."
39,2140,"May 26 2009 	Great Priceline Hotel...but not 4 stars	This hotel is in a fabulous location with very helpful staff and great rooms. Got it on Priceline for $88 incl tax/fees (bid $70), which makes it a great value. We upgraded to the club level/two beds for extra $25 at check-in. High quality bed linens too.Keep in mind that this hotel is not really at a 4* quality, maybe a 3*+? But still a great find on Priceline!"
40,2140,"May 22 2009 	not a 4 star but nice	This hotel would really be a 3 star not a 4. I've noticed if you are shopping around for hotels in San Francisco, whatever the rating states, go 1 star lower. The location is ideal, you are right downtown by union square. The room is decent but tiny, nothing fancy, no flat screen tv. The bathroom is suboptimal and cramped and they are extremely sparing and cheap with giving out their Aveda bath products. They won't refill it unless you ask. The room overall is quiet and clean, and average. They really don't need doormen because they never once opened a door but they do greet you in a friendly manner. The free high speed internet is a plus."
41,2140,"May 18 2009 	Pretty average overall-could be better could be worse...	My husband and I just stayed at the The Prescott last month for two nights. The location was the best part, being right around the corner from Union Square. When we checked in and went to our room, we couldn't leave when we wanted because our in room safe wouldn't work. We had to wait for someone to re-program it, but apparently this happens everytime someone checks in because someone's kid once locked the keys in the safe! Would be nice if they would take care of this before making us figure it out and have to wait for them to fix it. The hotel itself is older and in okay condition, the room was fine except the picture in the bathroom was filthy and looked like no one had cleaned it in years-pretty gross. One nice thing was that high speed internet was included in the room rate, which is not always the case with SF hotels. We upgraded to the club-level for $1 more and the evening cocktail reception was included. On Sunday night there were so many people there and only one poor guy serving drinks AND appetizers to everyone-pretty ridiculous. When we arrived, the cheese plate with bread was decimated-nothing left and apparently when its gone...its gone. Monday night was less busy and there were two people serving. Breakfast was a typical buffet continental breakfast, but it was hell to try to get some boiling water to make a real cup of tea. They were concerned I'd burn myself! I even told them they could just pour the boiling water into my cup with the teabag and then give it to me, but they just didn't get it. Overall, our stay could have been much better, but then again, it could have been much worse-so I guess this is better than the latter."
42,2140,"May 11 2009 	Great Location But Dated	Have stayed at the Prescott on several occasions while on business in SF. Usually get great rates for 4-star on Priceline and Prescott is a top choice.First off, the hotel is tucked away with a very unassuming front right off of Union Square. You have to look for it hard or you might miss it. It is a boutique hotel and once in the lobby, you get the sense immediately. The lobby is tight but quaint and never had a problem at check-in. Staff is great and very friendly. The rooms are a bit dated now. Most are in need of refurbish and do not meet the standards of a true 4-star as listed. On the plus side, most of the rooms are very large for a city hotel. Even though a bit tarnished, the rooms are always spotless and in good order. Lots of unusual hallways similar to other old hotels. They have a great wine tasting in the lobby daily and the Club Level is very nice. I'm not usally into that stuff but found myself a couple of times having a glass and meeting some other travelers. Most are from Europe and Latin America. Very interesting.In-room amenities are great. Sucker for a mini-bar and has a great one. Wireless and wired internet with good functional desk and chair. Lots of windows though usually your view is of other rooms, but natural light.They have an attached restuarant. Only had breakfast that was very good and reasonably priced for hotel ($17). Parking is terrible - but its that way anywhere in SF. $45-night and you must valet.The location is great. Just off Union Square and walkable to just about anywhere. We walked over to North Beach to eat Italian. It was especially great after dinner walking off that great meal at North Beach Italian (must try). You go right through China town. If you pick the right streets, you miss any big hills.Summary - if you get it cheap, a great hotel find. Not a true 4-star anymore, but would recommend for all the little things."
43,2140,"May 9 2009 	Sad what has happened with this hotel	The Prescott used to be one of my favorite hotels in San Francisco, impeccable rooms, impeccable service. That makes it even sader to see what it has turned into. Rooms badly need an upgrade, bad enough that they are teensy, but now they are shabby too. Stayed in the &quot;other&quot; building, walls so thin I could literally hear people going to the bathroom. Was on street, windows single glazed so noise all night, plus stomping of people overhead. No reason to put up with this place, too many better choices. Try the Hotel Palomar or Hotel Monaco instead, far, far better value for your money. (Also parking is a total rip off at $45 for overnight. You can go aroud the corner, park yourself for $20."
44,2140,May 8 2009 	Great Place to Stay In San Francisco	Great location in Union Square. Staff was attentive and welcoming. Rooms were nice. Kimpton does an excellent job!
45,2140,"May 4 2009 	Great location	Great location, downtown SFO. Walking distance from China town. Economical parking is an issue. Good cocktail hour."
46,2140,"Apr 24 2009 	Great Location	Great Location, just off Union Square. Rooms are small, but clean and quiet. Loved the club level breakfast and cocktail hour. Tip-even after you book, keep checking back for prices to decrease hotel site. Each time I saw a deceased, I called and they honored the lower price. They group I traveled with was very happy! This was may second stay at this hotel and would stay again."
47,2140,"Mar 12 2009 	Great location great service -room was a tad small	I stayed here in June of 2008 and the customer service was awesome, bed was comfy and the location can't be beat in terms of walking to shopping, museums, etc. The room was a bit small but given the prime location it is understandable that a builder would want to create as many possible rooms while still maintaining comfort. I would stay here again - I like kimpton hotels and liked this even better than the palomar (where I stayed on a prior visit)."
48,2140,"Feb 26 2009 	false advertisements on room size on hotel website and terrible customer service	According to the hotel front desk and website queen rooms are 300 sq ft, my room was tiny, more like 200 sq ft at most. I emailed kimptons loyalty group about this, as it is misleading/false advertising and it took them a while to get in touch with me. They then forwarded my concers to the manager, and it took him over a month to reply. Interesting that the reply came the day AFTER I had called kimpton in touch again to find out what was going on.According to the hotel website the queen rooms are 300 square feet. Yet upon our recent stay Jan 1-4, the room we had(#721 club level) seemed much much smaller, perhaps half the size. I actually did an estimate using my wingspan, and generously speaking I thought the actual room size to be more like 15ft by12ft=180 square feet. I called the hotel after doing more research and the Prescott also quoted 300 square feet and that all the queen rooms were the same size. Yet after doing some more reasearch i found out that the rooms were NOT all the same size and it turns out they are more like 200 square feet!The contradictory statements between the Manager, the front desk staff and the hotel website earns the Low rating based on the room size deception.I mean after all if the room is two thirds the advertised size, then should'nt I only be charged two thirds of the room cost? That would have made the 3 night stay, a 2 night charge, with one night free. Makes perfect sense mathematically speaking, but the Prescott doesnt seem to be very good with sense making."
49,2140,"Feb 18 2009	TERRIBLE customer service!!	We were in San Francisco for a funeral and had booked this hotel through Hotwire. After receiving notification of the hotel location, I called and spoke to the front desk to request that we have two double beds in the room. The front desk agent said that they didn't handle that and transferred me over to the reservations desk. There was no answer so I left a detailed message. The reservations agent never called back so I assumed that the two double bed request was handled. When we arrived, they had the audacity to charge us $25 extra for a room with two double beds. We checked in with Benny and when I voiced my disappointment over the extra fee, he just shrugged and said that the fee was usually $50. When I asked for management contacts, he gave me two cards. I called and left a message with Garret Gerritsen and he never called back. In this economy especially, you would think that hotels would be better about customer service. It's just appalling how unresponsive the clerks and management are at this hotel. Think twice before booking at the Prescott!"
50,2140,"Feb 8 2009	Great Hotel	Difficult to fault the Hotel. Rooms a tad small, but otherwise all was great. Friendly staff, comfortable bed, excellent location, and very reasonable rate. Breakfast is a bit expensive if you go for the buffet, but the a la carte is good value for the quality. Highly recommended."
51,2140,"Jan 2 2009 	A Delightful Hotel	Our first visit to San Francisco, chose this wonderful hotel, all the staff very attentitive, rooms very cosy beautiful furnished. Stayed for 2 nights 14 and 15 Dec and 28 Dec 08 for 1 night. I left my credit card on table in Club Lounge and it was returned to my room within 15mins, what honesty. Will return.Jeannette MurphyDublin Ireland"
52,2140,Jan 1 2009 	Loved it	Best stay. Excellent room. Benny at the front desk was great. He was so helpful and professional. He made our stay great.
53,2140,"Dec 22 2008	Great time...	After bidding on Priceline for a two-night weekend stay in union square area and finding out I was booked at the Prescott, i came to TA to read the reviews. i read about 25. Everyone was right about the &quot;old&quot; smell with a trace of animal...but...it is pet friendly and old. the smell bothered me on first entering the room, but after that it pretty much dissappeared. the hotel is in a GREAT location (as far as homeless---it is SF, they are everywhere). the walk to US, the mall, the theaters and great restaurants was easy. We took the train into the city so we had no car and didnt need one. Beware that the parking fees are 55.oo a night. The staff was friendly, although i know the area and didnt need to ask for directions or restaurant reccommendations. the housekeeping staff will knock and enter at the same time, so like a previous poster said use your DND sgn. my room was decorated like, but was not arranged like any of the rooms that are shown in the pictures above. my tub was big, the bath was big, i had a king bed and a large and small window opening to post street-- so we had a view. since the rooms are kind of at all angles i think that the room set up differs greatly between rooms ... as far as club level cocktail hour. it was only cheese, bread ,g rapes and an occasional &quot;postrio made in the wet bar area&quot; pizza BUT the drinks were the main benny . breakfast was high end pastries, bagels, muffins, breads, instant oatmeal, fruit, cereal, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, grapefruit and orange juice. i met alot of people during breakfast and cocktails that ALWAYS stay here every year and some more than that. so , they must be very consistant in thier good service! However, I think it is very important to know that i did not pay full price for this hotel...i think if i had paid 160 a night i would still think i got a good hotel. if i paid 300 dollars a night i wouldnt.... BTW...the Honey Honey cafe WAS great. and the Le colonial WAS great and we did Kuleto's for lunch and that WAS great, too! Hope this helps."
54,2140,"Nov 28 2008 	Great value for the price and location location location	The hotel is extremely well located, close to the Union square, many restaurants and attractions. The neighborhood feels safe. The service is friendly and accommodating. Each room has a recycling basket. The L'Occitane toiletery products are well appreciated. The complementary happy hour cocktails are refreshing. The room is charming and the bed is comfortable but the furniture and facility have past their prime age. Namely, the tiles in the bathtub have moles, the television is of a quality that can only fit a lower star hotel, the elevator is extremely slow, the floor in the room feels bumpy and there is no ventilation fan in the toilet and it does not have a window. The room is kept relatively clean, there is no dust on the furniture, the carpet feels soft and seems spotless, the towels and bed sheets are clean, and although the tiles are mouldy, the bathtub, the toilet and the sink feel clean. However the surface of the cotton ball container in the bathroom is sticky; the comforter does not have a cover and is wrapped between 2 bed sheets, therefore it easily gets dirty and stained; there is also a damp smell in the room when we first entered it, probably due to bad air circulation, but it eventually disappeared.All in all, we are very satisfied with the hotel considering the location, the friendly staff, the comfortable bed and the price we paid for the room (US $114 tx incl., king room, Hotwire, booked 5 days prior to arrival). Note to reader: we have been upgraded to a Club Level king from a deluxe queen, though we do not know what is the difference between these two types of room besides the size of the bed. Perhaps because the Club level rooms are located in an adjacent building, linked by a hallway with a slope, the hotel wanted to create value to compensate for the extra walk to get to those rooms by upgrading them to Club Level. This hotel could had been a high-end luxury hotel in the past but not in its current state. We will stay there again if the price is right."
55,2140,"Nov 22 2008 	Good choice if you get a deep discount	I won the Prescott Hotel on a Priceline bid of $85/night for a 3-night weekend stay in mid-November. I was a bit concerned about previous TA reviews citing musty-smelling rooms, dirty carpets, old bathrooms, noise, non-functioning wi-fi, etc. Fortunately, I didn't experience any of these problems during my 3 nights there, and overall I was happy with my stay, esp. considering the discounted price I paid.My late night check-in was quick and painless. I was given a room on the 6th floor. It faced the elevators, but noise from the hallway was never an issue. The room's only view was of an internal airshaft and other rooms, but the upside to this was that it was quiet. A street-facing room would have been much noisier. The only noise I ever got was an occasional creaky floorboard, as you would expect in an older building; this never bothered me. The room itself was compact but well laid out and well decorated, in a sort of Ralph Lauren brown paisley theme. I think two people with two large suitcases would have felt quite cramped in the room. Since I was staying by myself, I rather liked the room's snug and cozy proportions. Thankfully, there was no evidence of the musty smell that other reviewers had referred to. Also, the carpet was perfectly clean and the free wi-fi worked great throughout my 3-day stay.The bathroom was very spacious, and must have been recently renovated, as the tile, grout, wallpaper and shower curtain were all pristine. Everything was gleaming and spic and span. Water temperature and pressure were perfect, and the bathrobes and the L'Occitane toiletries were nice touches.The &quot;living room&quot; in the lobby is well decorated and a great space in which to relax with a cup of coffee and a newspaper. Complimentary coffee and tea are served 6-10 AM every day. It's too bad this service isn't available all day long, as is the case with some other Union Square hotels. The range of complimentary newspapers, including the NYTimes and the Wall Street Journal, was much appreciated.I never tried breakfast in the Postrio restaurant off the lobby; it offers a very limited menu and is seriously overpriced. Instead, every morning I took my free cup of coffee and headed off to the unpretentious, casual and welcoming Honey Honey cafe just 1/2 a block away, at the corner of Post and Taylor.I didn't need any special services while staying at the Prescott, so only had superficial contact with the staff. I would say they ranged from gracious and efficient to just passable. The housekeeping staff was lovely and did an outstanding job cleaning my room. Some of the front desk staff seemed more interested in gossiping and joking among themselves than in helping guests. One morning, I (very politely) let the young woman at the concierge desk know that the coffee carafe was empty, and she said not one word to me the whole time she replaced it. No &quot;good morning&quot;, no &quot;you're welcome&quot; when I thanked her; not a word. A few minutes later, I saw her give another guest the silent treatment, so it seems she wasn't allergic just to me. Quite a weird, off-putting experience more befitting of a hostel or budget hotel than one that bills itself as a luxury boutique hotel.I was able to shrug off the service lapses by reminding myself about my great Priceline deal. I'd definitely stay at the Prescott again for less than $100/night. But, for that weekend, the best rate available from the Prescott's own web site was $194/night - if I were paying that rate, I would find another hotel with better service standards and larger rooms."
56,2140,"Oct 18 2008 	Gotta love Priceline	Booked a last-minute four-star hotel on Priceline less than 24 hours before check-in and got the Prescott for 100 bucks for one night. Our room was located on the mezzanine and was bigger than any apartment I lived in during college -- hall, living room with dining table, separate bedroom, closets, long master bath. Prescott staff is wonderful and the hotel is well-appointed, as would be expected. Decor is elegant/modern. The hotel is located next to Postrio and just two blocks walk down Post Street to the top of Union Square. It's an ideal location with lovely rooms. Like most remodeled hotels, my only complaint is the bathrooms -- hotels never seem willing to spring for modern updates to their bathtubs and tilework -- and this room was no exception. But I highly recommend this place -- it definitely exceeded my expectations and a bargain price made the deal that much sweeter. If driving, parking prices are steep. You pay for convenience. Valet is $45 per night, and the public garage next door to the hotel is $34 per night with no valet -- not a big difference. The garage on O'Farrell is $28 per night but a longer walk."
57,2140,"Oct 13 2008 	Overpriced	We stayed in this hotel for three nights in September. Location wise the hotel is good, as it is a block away from Union Square. However, the hotel is very small and very English/French build. The reception is small and so are the rooms. Hardly any space to move around.The hotel staff is ok and not over excited to help you to their full capacity, we got the feeling. We wanted a shirt to be dry cleaned by the the hotel and they told us to go to the dry cleaner's around the corner instead of organising it them selves. We didn't opt for breakfast, but did make use of the gym. This was ok, but not too much variety in machines. The internet facilities were good though. In the end we felt that we didn't get the standard of service for the price we paid."
58,2140,"Oct 7 2008 	Really liked the prescott	We stayed at the Prescott hotel for the first three nights of our californian road trip and we were absolutely satisfied, the room was very nice and clean, although it smelled a bit old , but once you`ve opened the window that was gone.The restaurant was a bit overpriced and the portions were nothing special either but the amazing location of the hotel gives you plenty of other options to have breakfast or dine, we recommend the Mason Cafe just down the road from hertz (around the corner from the hotel) its about 5 min walk and with their fab organic food its a great way to get through your day :)We enjoyed our stay and will be happy to come back again or reommend this place to any of our friends :) It was our first time in the states and we felt welcome and taken care of, the staff in the hotel was very nice and helpful as well, although the charges for the internet in the hall were really high, but as we later found out it is the same in every hotel.There was a free wifi connection but we did not have our laptop with us.Overall: Will be back :)"
59,2140,"Oct 4 2008 	Great service for us.	We're just about to leave this cute and friendly hotel after a 7 night stay. It was been a place we have looked forward to coming home to after a day out. The girls at the front desk as been so kind and helpful to us. When we arrived we were upgrated to the club level, a nice treat. The rooms are nice, but I guess some find them small because the beds are so big. We got a two queens room, and the beds take up a lot of the room, but it's no big problem.The maids did a great room in our room, and never came in when we had the sign on. Got plenty of toiletries as well. Everyone at the hotel is very friendly and always say hello.The Concierge was helpfull with dinner reservations, calling cabs, printing out our boarding passes and even posting our postcards.The coctail hour was a good to. A glas of Champange for mom when the little one goes to bed.The location is great, just a short walk of Union Square and all the buzz there.We would stay here again for sure, if we got the same good price, about 140 dollars a night. I wouldn't spend more than that on any hotel though."
60,2140,"Oct 2 2008 	Worth the $124/night that I paid	I booked the Prescott hotel for $100/night ($124 after taxes and priceline booking fee) on priceline.com. This is definetely not a 4 star hotel but a 3 star boutique hotel. Since I only paid $124 night, I don't have a lot of complains. However, if I paid $200 - $250/night, I would be pretty upset as some other guests. The club level happy hour is not worth the $50 upgrade fee. The hotel advised Wolfgang Puck appetizers. I did not see any Wolfgang Puck apptizers other than a block of cheese, a bunch of grapes and a loaf of bread!"
61,2140,"Sep 28 2008 	Going downhill.	We have stayed at the Prescott a few times in the last several years and this time several flaws really stood out to me. I could see that it is in need of some upkeep in the maintainence of the building and rooms, and to some of the advertised amenities.  We always stay on the club level which gives a complimentary breakfast , afternoon drinks and as adverised &quot;hors d'ouerves from Postrio&quot; which is the Wolfgang Puck restaurant that adjoins the hotel. In the times I have stayed, this only amounts to cheese and crackers and pizza. Not sure where the other hors d'ouerves from Postrio that they talk about on their website or in the brochure on the lobby table are, but pizza , and a very scarce amount, is all that is to be had. The problem is the lounge area being staffed with one waiter to handle upwards of thirty or more guests. He must make drinks, replenish the cheese tray ( which never gets replenished because he's so busy), clean glasses and plates and also heat and serve a tiny 8 inch pizza every fifteen minutes or so. The pizza is so slow to come out and so small, that it only serves eight people a very tiny portion. It never makes it to most of the people in the room. It's a frustrating tease as you see it come out and then it's gone in thirty seconds and you have to wait another fifteen minutes. Plus all of this is too much for one person to handle. Why a few of the people hanging out at the front desk can't come up and lend a hand is beyond me. Also regarding the pizzas they should make several and have them on trays instead of this trickling out every fifteen minutes. Breakfast is the same way. One person to keep everything filled and stocked. They ran out of bowls one day and there were none left. The waiter was unable to supply any clean ones so even though the cereal was plentiful, there was no way to enjoy it. Then they ran out of plates. Again, none left. That was that. No attempt to even get any more.These advertised conceirge level amenities should be handled much more efficiently and staffed appropriately. Guests pay for this upgrade and expect what is advertised. A bowl for cereal, a plate for a muffin and a hot appetizer or two is not too much to ask when you pay the upgraded fee for these amenities. The rooms are small and the bathrooms smaller although luxury amenities ( l'occitane toiletries, frette linens, down comforters, plush robes and towels) make up for it. This last visit I noticed worn carpeting, peeling wallpaper, damaged marred wood trim in the two rooms occupied by our party and in the hallways and common areas. The bedside light was broken and the phone seemed to work intermittently. Wireless connection for the hotel was also out and the two lobby computers where not working.The small room tv's in the big armoires are out dated too. Most modern hotels have upgraded to a larger screen plasmas. Housekeeping was not diligent either. Toilettries were not replaced and they actually entered the room while the privacy sign was on the door and we were bathing and napping at 4PM to do turndown service. The front desk told us that check in time is when they do the turn down service. They came the next day at this same time. Beware that the privacy sign will not deter them from opening they door and coming in. This is a fairly pricey hotel for the size of the rooms and bathrooms and it seems to me that they have taken for granted the loyal repeat customers by not keeping things updated and improved. I have to say that in light of this last visit I may look into another hotel for future San Francisco stays."
62,2140,"Sep 27 2008 	Really nice but a few downsides	Prescott is a lovely hotel -- wonderfully decorated, attentive staff, well-appointed rooms. The small lobby is great with its fireplace and seating areas. Location is great and close walking distance for Union Square restaurants and shopping or a fun cable car ride to Nob Hill or Fisherman's Wharf. A friend and I easily caught a cab to the North Side for a down home Italian meal. As a solo female business traveler, I felt very safe and enjoyed my surroundings.The main problems I encountered had to do with the fact that this is an older building (that has been beautifully refurbished). First, my room had that musty smell that older properties around the world seem to have. It was pretty strong and distracting. It's unfortunate since the furnishings and finishes in my room were so pretty. I did not notice the musty smell in the lobby area or the hallways. Second, I could not get consistent wireless or cell phone service in my room, a real problem since I was in San Francisco for business. I overheard one of the front desk people tell a guest that because it is an older building, the walls are very thick, making cell phone service and wireless spotty. It actually was very frustrating for me because I was not able to do the work I needed to do. I went down to the lobby seating area to make my cell phone calls, and got fine cell phone service there (I almost never have trouble getting cell service). Third, the water pressure was very low in my shower. I tried adjusting it but no change. I took a shower under a trickle of water. When I informed the front desk as I was checking out so they could address the problem for the next guest, the gentleman behind the desk insisted I must not have adjusted the shower head properly. I told him I tried but it still did not work, and he once again insisted that the problem must have been my own. I was quite surprised that he didn't just apologize for my inconvenience and say he'd have maintenance look at it. It made me leave on a bit of a sour note.Although a very pretty hotel in many respects, I would not stay here again because of the musty smell of my room and the slightly negative note the front desk staff left me with upon my departure."
63,2140,"Sep 23 2008 	Not great but good for the value	Stayed here one night in Sept. 2008 with my husband. We booked this room on Priceline for $108 a night. For the price and location, I really can't complain. Room has an old romantic feel. Rooms are small, bathrooms a little dated. My biggest beef was the stale smell throughout the hotel. But overall, slept like a log. Not bad for a night."
64,2140,"Sep 15 2008 	Great Location-Otherwise not So Great	I planned a last minute weekend trip to San Francisco for me, myself and I after getting a great airfare through Virgin America. I then booked a room at this hotel using a special rate available through the Kimpton website. I spent more than I wanted to but thought that since the room available was on the &quot;club&quot; level, I would get some perks. According to the website, every evening, hors d'oeuvres would be available from Postrio, the restaurant located in the lobby and a well-known restaurant at that. The club level also included breakfast. The location is fantastic, 2 blocks from Union Square. The lobby is small but very nice and welcoming. The staff was friendly but not all together helpful especially with information regarding public transportation. As far as my room-- well, I must have gotten the last room available as I checked in very late. I also think I was given a regular room with club &quot;perks.&quot; instead of a real club room. The room at first glance was very nice but then you can see real age. My primary problem was the creaking floors. I have never heard this before in any hotel, not even Super 8s. I looked forward to sleeping in on Saturday, 8:30! Well, beginning at 6 am all I heard were people walking above and around me. Every inch of that ugly, dirty carpet needs to be ripped up and every floor board needs to be screwed down. It is unacceptable that this noise pervades the hotel. I also didn't realize I was given a room diagonally across from the housekeeping room. 7 a.m. or so I would hear the maids talking and moving their carts. It was as if there was no door at all between me and the hallway. Needless to say, I got very little sleep any of the 3 nights I stayed at the Prescott. The bathroom also showed its age a lot, dirty grout. The L'Occitane products were excellent, however.Next, as far as club level amenities, there was a bar open at 4:30 pm but the hors d'oeuvres were non-existent. I do not consider a block of cheese, a bunch of grapes and a loaf of bread hors d'oeuvres. The continental breakfast was just fair but did the job. FYI, you can get wine and beer on the regular level rooms in the lobby for no extra charge and you don't need any of those fake hors d'oeuvres. For $50 more per night, the club level rooms are simply not worth it. When I'm in San Francisco, I want a room in a good location and I want to be able to sleep for whatever hours I'm in my room. The rest of the time, I'm not in the hotel. The creaking floors and poor sound insulation are competely unacceptable. I would not at all call this a 4* hotel. I would consider it 3* but no matter what, I will not stay here again if the floors are not fixed and I would not pay more than $100 to $119 for this hotel."
65,2140,"Sep 7 2008 	Advice from a former local--Do Not Stay Here	I used to live in San Francisco. During the time that I lived here, I booked and accompanied my relatives to many other SF hotels (Nikko, Hotel Monaco, Hyatt Embarcadero, Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf, Sir Francis Drake, Hotel Diva). The Prescott is one that I would definitely NOT recommend.I came here for a weekend, after researching many many hotels. It puzzles me why this hotel has 4 circles on tripadvisor.I booked a regular &quot;Queen&quot; room and upon check-in, was given room #606. The room itself is small but the bathroom was of fair size. The toilet is the old 70s style toilet. Without going into detail, it is difficult to sit on it and kinda curves in at an agle. It's a very strange toilet. The only redeeming items in the bathroom are the wondeful L'Occitane bath products---but don't let that lure you to this hotel.The bed is not a Queen and is only a larger Full size bed. The windows are from the original styling and era of the building. The room itself smelled of moldy wood or damp furniture. The room itself faced another building (which is fine), but the other building had a power generator/air conditioning unit which sounded like a loud motor the entire time during my stay. At night, the noise level ironically blocked out street noise. However, the noise itself made it hard to fall asleep and was not the serene, relaxing experience I had hoped for. It appeared ALL of the rooms on my side of the building can hear this noise. The entire building only has 7 floors, so I don't know if going higher or lower would help alleviate this noise problem.Also, the position of the room allowed me to smell food cooking in the building through the vents. It was weird.The service was generally hit or miss. The front desk clerk at check in was very unpleasant, but the front desk clerk at check-out was very nice. The room service cleaning ladies were wonderful and seemed to work hard at their jobs. The bell hop was at times missing.The hotel lobby has free computers with which you can use to print out your boarding passes. This was the only upside of our entire stay. In the morning, there is free coffee. In the evening, there is wine and cheese.Although the location is superb, there are many many many hotels in the Union Square area of the same price which offers a much better (and seeming much more consistent) experience. The hotel itself and hotel room was not much better than the crappy apartment I lived in when I was a student in San Francisco many years back. That being said, I would not pay $180/night to stay my crappy apartment ever again.Having stayed in other hotels in SF/Union Square area, I would recommend the Hotel Nikko and the Hotel Monaco (also a Kimpton Boutique just down on Geary).I rarely write reviews but felt that all the tripadvisor reviews thus far did not really illuminate the problems in this building. I'm not sure which rooms those people were provided---maybe they saved the lesser hotel rooms for people from California =) In any event, the 4 circles on tripadvisor is misleading, which was a huge disappointment for me."
66,2140,"Sep 5 2008 	Charming Older Hotel- Great Location	I booked this hotel through Hotwire, so I obviously did not pick it. However, once Hotwire notified me what hotel had been selected, I researched it on the Internet and was pleasantly surprised. The ratings all seemed to be in the 4-5 star categories and the hotel appeared to be in a great location for shopping and other SF touristy things. **One hint- if you stay at a Kimpton Hotel, log on to their website beforehand and sign up for the Kimpton Club. It is free and allowed us a free upgrade upon arrival.Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly hotel staff. They greeted us by name and told us they had upgraded our room to the Club Level. Im not sure how this differed from the other rooms, but we did walk into a different area of the hotel which had its own sitting room, complete with continental breakfast in the morning.The rooms themselves (we had two) are definitely small, but that is to be expected in San Francisco, especially at the boutique hotels. The rooms were older, but exceptionally cleanas were the bathrooms. For an older hotel, the rooms were also very quiet. We stayed at the #1 rated Hotel Drisco (Pacific Heights) before and it sounded like people were in our room as they walked by the hallway!As for the locationGreat! We had a toddler and two seniors in our group, so being close to the action was important. The hotel is a mere 1  blocks off of Union Square, so walking was no problem for anyone in the group.Overall, had a very nice experience. We paid $122.00/room (plus tax) for a Monday night. This was through Hotwire.com"
67,2140,"Sep 5 2008 	Location Location Location	Because the Kimpton chain started in San Francisco, there are quite a few choices. The Prescott is on the lower end of the price range, so you'll find more tourists here than business people.The Good: The location is great. Two blocks from Union Square and ample public transportation. Lots of great restaurants and shopping in the neighborhood. The rooms are a decent size, and the bathrooms and closets are a decent size for a large city. The beds are extremely comfortable (as expected at a Kimpton property).  The Club Level is a great amenity at this property. Club Level guests have access to a free, 2-hour wine reception which includes a full-bar and pizza from Postrio, the Wolfgang Puck restaurant located in the hotel.The Bad: The Club Level is located in a different building, which means you need to take two elevators to get to your room. Inconvenient.  The elevators need a serious update. They are slow, and staff is quick to push you out if they are accompanying other guests to their rooms.  The staff is rather uninterested and unfriendly, which is quite unusual for a Kimpton hotel. I was really taken aback by the lack of hospitality here. Overall, the wine hour on the Club Level was delightful, the room was comfortable, and the staff needs more training on how to be hospitable. I'd stay again...but only for pleasure, and only if the price was right. I'd stay at the Monaco on the company's dime."
68,2140,"Aug 26 2008 	Great Location	The Prescott is excellently located a very short walk from Union Square. The rooms, for someone travelling from London are not as small as I feared after reading other reviews. The front desk is friendly and helpful and the complimentary wine reception each evening is very welcome.Joining the Kimpton In-touch loyalty programme after I booked and emailing the hotel with my membership number appeared to give check-in an extra incentive to help find me a room on a higher floor - but helpfulness definitely comes as standard here."
69,2140,"Aug 19 2008 	Excellent facility and superb service. Go there. Be happy.	This hotel made our stay in San Francisco worth while.  We had been staying at the Serrano, also Kimpton, around the corner ,and were aghast at the Serrano's poor level of service, which ranged from perfunctory to near trip sabotage. I wandered into the Prescott after I saw it on Priceline, and asked with some trepidation to look at a room; we were treated with genuine friendly professionalism from the moment I stepped in. I booked the room: the service, if anything was even better after we checked in. Lane (pronounced LANIE) at the front desk recommended a totally cool restaurant in the Mission based on my preferences. The bellman took a blank map of Sonoma and Napa and penciled in a dozen boutique wineries that we would never have found on our own. We only went to four, but all were interestingly idiosyncratic, with fine wines and we bought a case or more gladly- no &quot;tour bus destinations&quot; in the bunch. Despite the ridiculously low price we paid - I would gladly pay double that to stay again- we received a free upgrade to the club level. All our heavy bags were well taken care of and placed carefully for opening by the bellman for my wife while I was parking the car- thanks Jerry. Oh yes, and they validated our cut-rate hotel parking [something the Serrano flat out refused to do (I asked three times and each time they tried to get me to use their $50 dollar a day service instead-this was the deal-breaker on the Serrano). Room was a bit small, but well laid out; had a large modern bathroom, and the location is central enough for most anyone. It's worth repeating that the service (including that at the happy hour open bar and snacks (a bar bill alone at the Clift around the corner for a similar treat would have exceeded what we spent on the entire room at Prescott -tip the bartender generously!)) was perfect in the easygoing and unfussy manner of well-trained professionals just doing their job well. Stay there, even if you don't get a great deal on a discount site."
70,2140,"Aug 19 2008 	Nice hotel	We stayed at the Prescott three nights and had a really great stay. The staff were friendly and both check-in and check-out went smoothly. We stayed in a deluxe queen room, which were spacious and nicely furnished and nice amenities. Clean! I am not sure if I liked that one wall (the one behind the bed) were covered by a huge mirror though. Complimentary wifi!Parking was expensive, so we parked at another garage a couple of minutes walk away for almost half price. Great location right by Union square."
71,2140,"Aug 16 2008 	Two nights at the Prescott	We stayed here because of the location, the reputation of Kimpton Hotels, and an unbelievable rate on TravelZoo ($119 for a queen room). The room was moderately small (in other words, big by NYC standards), but it was fine, and the bed was comfortable.When we checked in, the thermostat was set at 62, and the a/c was blasting. It was so cold we had to turn the heat on to make it bearable. I noted that in the hotel's guest questionnaire. Kimpton Hotels say they are energy conscious, but I guess a staff member didn't get that memo.We had steel-cut oats for breakfast in the hotel restaurant, which has a diverse if somewhat pricey menu. Overall, a good stay."
72,2140,"Aug 7 2008 	An excellent choice no question!	This is it! I researched nearly ALL the hotels in San Francisco and I found this one... Great! We booked our room directly through their website and got an excellent deal! When we arrived there, they upgraded our room to a club level, which means we had free breakfast in the morning (a great one I might add) AND free alcohol&amp;appetizers just before dinner. Rooms are small yes, but charming and very clean. The bed is very comfortable, and the hotel is extremely well-located. After a day visiting San Francisco, it was nice to relax in this charming little room."
73,2140,"Jul 22 2008 	Great location right price	As others have mentioned, the location and immenities can't be beat for the price. While the rooms are not on the high end of 4 star quality, the bed was fantastic and small bathroom just fine. Just stayed here with my boyfriend and my two dogs (Kimpton hotels are dog friendly). I couldn't believe the fantastic service, from providing our dogs with individual fluffy dog beds to the doorman devising a wine tasting route in Anderson Valley for us. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We opted not to park at the hotel due to the high rates, so parked next door (entrance on Post) for a lower cost ($32 for 24 hrs or if arrive after 6pm, 14 hours for $16 with hotel bill). It did not offer in and out privileges, though. We also were able to secure a great rate on the room on a well known travel website (TZ), which ended up being half the price. Make sure and register as a Kimpton member on their website, www.kimptonhotels.com, before you make a reservation. Many times, as was our case (and even on a holiday weekend!), upon check in, we were upgraded for free to Club level. This entitled us to enjoy a complimentary daily breakfast and cocktail hour.FYI - If bringing dogs, let them know ahead of time that you want dog beds, as one of the nights, they were all out."
74,2140,"Jul 20 2008 	Just Okay	This hotel is in a good location in downtown S.F. the staff was very friendly and the hotel has a certain old fashion charm. However the rooms are very small and out dated. The bathroom was extremely small and the tub was dirty. $45.00 per day parking, and the valet made us loose our dinner reservation, we waited over 30 minutes for our car and we even called ahead, this was not cool at all. I would not stay here again."
75,2140,"Jul 13 2008 	WONDERFUL HOTEL IN A GREAT LOCATION!!!	My husband and I spent six nights at the Prescott Hotel and had a great time. The hotel reminded us of a European hotel, especially the small bathroom. It was exactly what we expected. If we were looking for a hip, glitzy, modern hotel we would not have stayed here.The rooms were impeccable and kept that way daily by housekeeping. All of the staff we dealt with were exceptional and very interested in our having a wonderful stay. The nightly happy hour is a nice amenity. The hotel is very quiet and gives one a very secure feeling. The location is great - a block to the cable car (if you can ever get on one), near public transporation, a couple of blocks from Union Square and numerous fantastic restaurants.All in all this is a great hotel if you are looking for an older, quiet hotel with an ambiance and in a central location. We look forward to returning."
76,2140,"Jul 7 2008 	Great hotel and location!	Great hotel. It was very quiet and a very convient location. Just a few blocks from the cable cars and if you need to rent a car for a day trip, Hertz is just around the corner. We would stay there again."
77,2140,"Jun 30 2008 	can do better	I had just come from Toronto where I stayed in an excellent 3-star hotel, and was expecting this 4-star hotel to be even better.There is a great fancy lobby, and very friendly staff, but the room was terribly disappointing. The bathroom was nice and was clean. But the furntiture and the television were seriously outdated.Also, everything had a price-tag on it, which I find really unpleasant. There were no tea/coffee facilities in the room, and the room service was expensive and of poor quality. I was starving when i arrived so ordered a pizza, which arrived cold. I requested a breakfast the first morning and they got my order wrong.The hotel location is good however - being right next to union square. And the staff were helpful in getting me a flat-rate taxi to the airport.I would not stay here again, and wouldnt advise my friends to either."
78,2140,"Jun 25 2008 	Good stay at the Prescott for two days in June	I booked this at the last minute for a conference - only stayed two days and found the place to be decent. The location is ideal for tourists who want to be close to the sights like Union Square, cable car, chinatown, etc.. The hotel is nice, nothing over the top and nothing terrible...just right. My room could have used a little updating, but the place was quiet, clean and affordable which were my only requirements. Here's the skinny:PROS: Location, Staff, restaurant was nice too.CONS: no high speed internet - but there is available wireless in the rooms. I just wish it was a bit quicker but its better than nothing. Also my room was a bit outdated. RECOMMENDATION: Sure! It did the job for 48 hours and the location is great for seeing the sights."
79,2140,"Jun 17 2008 	Not quite what I expected from Kimpson	This hotel is old, and not so much in a charming way. The hall going to my room was stuffy, and smelled. The carpet in my room desprately needed to be tightened- there were ridges so big you could trip on them. The floor was squeaky, and when I had to turn on the heat the ailing motor kept me up all night with a loud screech. I could hear my neighbors' TV thru the walls at night, and could hear the clanking of their room service tray in the AM, like my door was open.The location of this hotel is great, and I did get a great fare on travelocity, but it is definitely not on par with Kimpson properties in DC, where I am from. I was expecting a funky boutique hotel, but it didnt feel like that at all (except for the great floral bouquets in the lobby). The food at the restaurant was over priced for what is offered. Lastly, I was mostly bothered by the deposit they made me give &quot;in case&quot; I used the incidentals. The thing is, they never gave me the key to the honor bar or the frig."
80,2140,"Jun 15 2008 	Great Location Great Staff	My sister booked me a last minute, one night stay with a great rate from travelzoo at The Prescott for a Friday night. When we arrived, we quickly found out the reservation was made by my sister for the wrong night, and without the special rate.The wonderful staff was very helpful in correcting both of these issues, leading to a very happy customer. The hotel offers a free welcoming beer or wine upon arrival, and certain higher floors offer breakfast and other amenities.Location is an easy 2 block walk from Union Square, which offers some very nice shopping and other activities. Also conveniently located near the cable car lines and only 3-4 blocks from a BART station.This hotel has a nice look inside, and offers many in-room spa and massage treatments. This, along with some other features, was not something we did on a one night stay.Negatives: Poor cell signal in room and view in some rooms, to be expected in an urban hotel. As well, some of the in room features are showing a little age. And the bathroom was a little small for a big guy and his pregnant wife!Overall, a good stay, but I can't say I'd do it again for the much steeper regular price."
81,2140,"May 8 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location	Nice boutique hotel in a great location. Our room was comfortable and surprisingly quiet, overlooking Post Street. A very short walk to Union Square shops, nearby art galleries, theaters, a cable car stop, and BART station. Complementary wine and beer hour in the lounge. This is the nicest hotel in the best location I've ever been able to afford in San Francisco. Hotel parking was pricey ($45). We found overnight parking for $20 nearby. We got a great price on our hotel room by bidding on Priceline."
82,2140,"May 7 2008 	Location and charm in San Francisco	The Prescott is a charming upscale boutique hotel with a fabulous location and friendly staff.I just got back from vacation in San Francisco, and the hotel contributed to an overall wonderful trip. The hotel is attractive with clean rooms that are a pleasure to come &quot;home&quot; to at the end of an eventful day. The beds are comfortable and the linens are of good quality - I especially loved the thick towels.The club level includes a lovely breakfast and cocktails and snacks in late afternoon/early evening. These perks are certainly worth an upgrade, and the staff who hosts the breakfast and cocktail hour are friendly and helpful beyond what we expected.The hotel could not be better located. It's close to Union Square, shopping, cable cars, etc. . . .In addition, every staff member we encountered was extremely helpful and friendly. They consistently made us and other guests feel welcome and comfortable.I would definitely recommend this hotel to others."
83,2140,"Apr 29 2008 	Excellent friendly central hotel	We loved the hotel, it was so friendly we were upgraded to Club which with excellent breakfasts and cocktails and really good snacks was brilliant value. The staff were exceptionally friendly. Right near Union Square and by the Trolley stops (but not too noisy). Get up early if you want to use the trolley bus hang on and take a camera.ps dont bother with Jacks restaurant of Maltese Falcon fame pretty location but crowded tables, very average food and surly staff. and the live music was muzac by a realy bored guitarist no one was listening no one cared tourist trap ++"
84,2140,"Apr 11 2008 	Great Stay at the Prescott	I stayed at the Hotel Prescott for business for almost a week. The hotel is small and cozy, and centrally located near Union Square -about a block away from a lot of shopping and activity. The hotel staff was friendly, attentive and gave us some great restaurant recommendations during our stay. The hotel restaurant is also very good, and seems to be popular in general. Overall this was a good experience and I would probably stay there again."
85,2140,"Apr 8 2008 	Enjoyed my stay at The Prescott	The Price:I went on priceline to look for a hotel deal in San Francisco. I paid only $500 for 5 nights (normally goes for $200-300 per night). It was worth every penny. The Room:The Prescott has a very upscale feel. The rooms are clean, quiet, and beautiful. The bed linens are soft and mattress is very comfortable. The room itself is small, but they make good use of the space. My only complaint about the room is that the water pressure in the shower isn't great.The Staff: The hotel staff was very helpful. They had great tips... where to dine, what to see, how to get around, etc. Also, there is a private club on the 4th floor of the hotel that offers a complimentary breakfast and happy hour (full bar &amp; appetizers). We didn't pay for the club membership, but the front desk slipped us a key pass anyhow. Location:If you want to be in Union Sq, this hotel is perfect. There is lots of shopping, restaurants, and other things to do. The Prescott is one block from the heart of Union Square. There are some homeless in the area, and a suspicious massage parlor around the corner, but overall, the neighborhood feels safe. It's close the to BART and the Powell St Trolley. It's a $7 cab ride to Fisherman's Wharf, The Ferry Building, and AT&amp;T Park. $35 cab ride (plus tip) to the airport."
86,2140,"Apr 2 2008	Wonderful Gem	We really lucked out to find the Prescott. It was just on a whim we decided to stay downtown after attending my best friends wedding. The hotel is just steps from Union Square and we loved drinks and a light meal at Postrio. Yes, the hotel building is old but it is clean, well maintained and very, very charming. The staff is attentive and friendly, unlike the staff you might find across the street at one of those big, brand name hotels. I was greeted by name and so was my dog each time walked by the front desk! Oh yes, the price was right too... only $199 and we got an upgrade to a Suite... sweet!"
87,2140,"Mar 31 2008 	Absolutely wonderful	What a wonderful visit for my mother, 5 year old son and I. Everyone there went out of their way to help us and make it a great visit!"
88,2140,"Mar 27 2008 	Small rooms Rude staff!	At first, I was excited to stay in the Prescott for my vacation after seeing the reviews and getting a decent price of $105, through priceline. I even bragged to my friends how impressed they would be for what we payed.....boy was I wrong! Within the first few minutes this seems like a nice hotel...until you get to your small cramped room with the outdated small TV! Definitely should not be a four star. Most of the staff was decent...EXCEPT the late night front desk women with the glasses. She was extremely rude! One example of this was when we asked her advise for a nice nightlife area, she sent us to a crime-ridden street where we were nearly mugged! Even after this she was very UNHELPFUL!..."
89,2140,"Mar 25 2008	Tired Rooms Rude Staff	We had stayed at the Prescott a few times before but not in recent years, since it became a Kimpton property. It's become run-down and a little shabby and not nearly as nice as it once was. The rooms need a make-over.We were given an awful room when we checked in, dark, musty, cramped and when we asked nicely if there were other rooms available, the staff had a really bad attitude. Evenually we were shown a bigger room, though it was very noisy and the furnishings were shabby.We ate a very expensive breakfast at the hotel with lousy service, no spoons or sugar for the coffee, unfriendly waitress.it was very disappointing to find a hotel that you once loved, to have become tired and unkempt. For the money, you can do much better elsewhere."
90,2140,"Mar 11 2008 	Christmas at the Prescott	The Prescott was wonderful. Reading all the reviews and viewing the website created an expectation. The hotel met those expectations. We didn't book the Prescott and expect the Ritz. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The staff was courteous and helpful. Everything promised, was delivered.We were there over Christmas w/ 2 little children. They allowed us to utilize the lobby fireplace for Santa's arrival. In fact, some of the staff contributed to make the Christmas quite memorable. You simply can't beat the location. Right in the middle of everything. We were there a week. We utilized the trolley or taxis most days. On our two excursion days, we rented a car from the Hertz right around the corner.Would definitely recommend this property."
91,2140,"Mar 8 2008 	Beautiful quiet hotel!	We stayed here for our honeymoon and had a great, relaxing stay. The rooms are nicely decorated, had a very comfortable bed. The hotel is obviously older, the floors squeak when you walk. Everything was very clean. The continental breakfast that was included was very nice, and the evening wine and snacks were delicious. The hotel is close to Union Square, and it was very easy to get around the city from here."
92,2140,Mar 3 2008 	Great Staff Quiet Room Good Nights Rest	We arrived 4 hours before check-in time but the front desk put us in a room right away. Sadly My Wife and I did not care for the location so we asked nicely if we change rooms and were placed in a room in much better location in the hotel. From then on our next 3 nights at the Prescott where great. The Staff treated us with respect and helped us make our trip fun. I would be happy to stay at the Prescott again.
93,2140,"Mar 3 2008 	Needs a makeover!	This hotel is rated as 4-Star by Hotwire.com. I got three nights for $110/night.Gripes:- It doesn't feel like a 4-Star hotel, by any measure of &quot;luxury&quot;. Rooms are furnished with a lot of old, worn, once-nice furniture. However, carpets and walls and draperies feel worn, old, and therefore dirty - you cringe and try to avoid. Similar for the half-remodelled bathroom.- 19&quot; TV?! - NOT a business hotel! There is a small table which is located next to the window (facing another window) - a far far way from the speakerphone placed on the bedside table....which leads me to...- No available cell service in my room. I had to go downstairs to take a few conference calls. For others, I had to rig up a workstation on the bed with the power cord to my laptop in one direction and the phone cord in another direction to the wall on the other side.- heating/AC is a bit dated and slightly wheezyPluses:- free internet (come on - everyone's gotta have this now)- coffee and tea downstairs in the morningsIf you need to be right in Union Square, sure, this is probably a decent choice. It is clear of the sketchy side of Tenderloin. However, personally,I usually try to get a good rate in the Embarcadero where the hotels tend to be newer and with larger rooms."
94,2140,"Feb 13 2008 	Pretty but lacking in typical services	The hotel is pretty. They have great uniforms (including white gloves) on the door men and the lobby is nice and clean. They have special Prescott Hotel wrappers on the chocolates they put on the pillows at night and Prescott Hotel labeling on the extra toilet paper rolls. The small room was mostly clean, but the dirty spot that was on the table when we arrived was still there when we left 4 days later. Our room looked out on the windows of other rooms in the hotel, so we could open it to get fresh air (which the room desperately needed), but there was no view. Urban hotel, okay. The bathroom was quite large, but oddly enough there was no counter space, so we moved furniture from the crowded bedroom into the bathroom to put our suitcase and toiletries on.There are nice robes in the room - if you are under 5 ft 2 and under 135 pounds. Both robes in our room were tiny and fraying at the neck. But they had a great Prescott Hotel logo on them.In the mornings, they had nice coffee and tea selections in the lobby, and offered several newspapers free to guests, including the Sunday NY Times (on Sunday).The bellmen were consistently helpful, opening doors (not really necessary but nice) and agreeing to take photos.The problem was the front desk. They were consistently unhelpful. The concierge was basically worthless. She was unable to help us 2 of the 3 times we asked, and on the occasion when she tried to help, she gave us the wrong address for the restaurant we were going to. When we left, they offered us the &quot;house car&quot; to the airport. At first we thought this was a nice offer, and appropriate after we had paid over $1,400 for a 4 night stay. When we got to the airport, we offered the driver a generous tip, only to learn that there was a fare involved. He asked for $55 at that time. A phone call afterwards to their management office informed us that the normal charge is $45. It took 5 phone calls to get the $10 refunded and to get a receipt for the house car. A cab would have cost $35.The front desk also cannot give postage, so bring your own stamps.We won't stay there again, and will avoid the chain (Kimpton) since they seem to value style over service."
95,2140,"Feb 4 2008 	Love this place	Stayed here once at the end of last summer with someone I loved and had to return. When a business trip afforded the opportunity, I took it. This trip I went alone but still found the ambience- in the midst of the city- to be relaxing and pleasurable. Small rooms but clean and nicely done. Everyone was very pleasant. Discovered Biscuits and Blues right around the corner with live blues performances and great food. San Francisco is still my favorite city, this hotel one of my favorites. Perfect for a romantic getaway or if you need to be centrally located. The evening wine is not the best but free and drinkable- so why complain. Mornings they bring in Starbuck's coffee!"
96,2140,"Jan 22 2008	One of the Finest Hotel Experiences I've ever had !!!!	I was attending a medical conference and decided to stay off the beaten path (ie. decided against one of the larger chain hotels suggested in the conference literature). It was an extremely fortunate decision. There was absolutely nothing I did not like. The room was impeccable. The Club floor was a comfortable place to wind down with the paper at the end of the day. The staff was exceptional. While not austere, they were not overly gregarious either. Just appropriately helpful and respectful. The restaraunt was superb.I suppose this hotel may not appeal to a family with young children but for the single traveler or couple,....Perfect."
97,2140,"Jan 18 2008 	Kept Us Happy	We stayed here for a couple nights at the beginning of January 08 guided by the positive reviews (we had no car!) and our experience of the Kimpton chain. We were not disappointed. Thanks no doubt in part to the time of year ( the hotel was very quiet), the staff had plenty of time to be friendly and helpful (it did take a couple of calls to reception to get some ice but they were sorry for the delay).Our room faced the street (6th floor so noise not too bad; we always carry ear plugs!). It was absoulutely fine for the two of us and appealing in an old fashioned way. Certainly not too small. Bathroom was smart and up to date with robes and lots of nice touches (free stuff!).Location is king with Union Sq and Market St all within a few minutes walk. We used the Bart from the airport and although up hill (!), easily wheeled our bags from the station to the hotel late in the evening (the streets always seem to be busy).A plus for us was the gym which once you have puzzled your way through the maze of corridors, lifts and wrong turns is useful with a nice view over the roof tops. We would criticise the lack of tea / coffee facilities in the room. There are some facilities laid out in the morning in a room next to reception (why not all day?) but nothing else and it seems that given the nice setting, with a bit more imagination this facility could have made this a really nice experience for guests. Also, why does the 'pay as you go' internet have to be so expensive to use? (our receptionist took pity on us and checked us in for the flight home using her PC as she was so understretched). One odd thing is that the hotel delivers a copy of the New York Times to the room every morning (not free). Given that visitors are more likely to find the SF paper useful this is an odd choice. Top tip - cancel the NYT at check in unless you really want it.Overall, despite the feeling that this is a hotel with lots of ways it could annoy you with little things, we would return (and try to get the same room - 617)."
98,2140,"Dec 22 2007 	Great service good deal - but consider leaving the car at home	Price: We were extremely happy with our special winter internet rate. The one money &quot;meh&quot; was the fifty bucks/day to park, which won't affect you if you're travelling sans wheels. Sure, it's valet. Yes, you do get in-and-out priviledges, and the valets are fast retrieving your vehicle for you. And yes, I realize parking costs a mint downtown and is often a schlep from places you may need to go (we were actually glad for it, as my friend is disabled). But $50 bucks? Particularly if you're a regular guest paying full rack rate? I guess it depends on your particular situation, and what you're looking for in a hotel. Many of the better hotels in the city do charge this kind of dough for parking, and the alternatives are either pricey or risky (street parking?!), so I suppose you could make a case for 'it evens out.' Staff/service: Great. Everyone was very eager to help...The concierge even walked my friend around the corner to Walgreen's to get a sharps container for her needles. There were warm cookies awaiting us on arrival, which was a nice touch. Location: The hotel is very close to Union Square and San Francisco Centre, among other points of interest. It's definitely NOT in scarysville.Facilities/Amenities: The hotel is comfortable and cozy. The back rooms basically have an airshaft view, but that's par for the course in a small, urban hotel. The standard rooms are not huge, but they're not astonishingly tiny, either. Mirrors and good furniture layout make for plenty of room. While the Prescott may lack some &quot;massive hotel complex&quot; features like a pool, they do a good job of making up for it with service touches like free refreshments. In all, we got a nice 4-star experience for 3-star price (qualified, perhaps, by the parking situation). Had we been without a car, we would've stayed another night. Luckily, my house is close enough we didn't have to stick out the extra parking cash. ;)"
99,2140,"Dec 19 2007	Small room great sheets	Having gotten an amazing deal of $129/night, through a one day sale the hotel was having, decided to try the Prescott. Had eaten at Postrio, which is in the hotel, so knew that it was an older property. The room was small, the t.v. was ancient, and the walls thin. The bathroom, though also tiny, was well appointed with a cozy robe and good bath products. The highlight of the room was the sheets, which were heavenly. They are Frette, and are for sale by the hotel.Was upgraded to the concierge floor as I am a Kimpton program member. A lovely continental breakfast was offered, though there was insufficient seating to accomodate everyone who was there.If I had paid $250 or $350/night, would not recommend, but if you can get a deal comparable to mine, would say it is a great hotel."

When you're on the Club Level, you have a 2-hour Cocktail Reception from 4:30pm-6:30pm. It was awesome! I was on my way to The Cult concert at the Warfield, so this cocktail reception was a perfect start to a fun night. When I got to my room, I had lovely amenities and a welcome note from the hotel General Manager Tom. I met Tom when I was checking in. He is a really cool guy. What Hotel General Manager would know who The Cult is?? Most Hotel GMs are old stuffy guys... but not Tom. The room was very cozy and I loved how the sitting area was arranged. It was like staying in your own home. Very comfortable. The next morning, after I was able to stumble out of bed, I dropped by the lounge for a lovely breakfast. It was a prettier version of a continental breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit juices, the granolas &amp; cereal and the pastries were great. There was also a nice selection of fresh fruit. I was happy with my stay at the lovely Prescott Hotel."
101,2140,"Dec 2 2007	Wonderful service and location.	We stayed at the Prescott for five nights and loved the intimate feel of it. Even though it is a Kimpton hotel, and thus part of a chain (something we attempt to avoid), it was a unique experience. The hotel is very attractive. We experienced no problems whatsoever during our stay. The location was incredibly convenient and allowed us to explore the city with ease. Postrio, the restaurant located in the hotel was superb. It was one of the best meals I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.I know its silly, but one of the details that I appreciated was the fact that the shampoo and soaps were very nice. They also had a workout facility, something I really appreciate as well.  In addition, the concierge was very helpful. She helped us rent a car to drive to Napa Valley and recommended some good wineries. She also got us a last minute reservation at the restaurant which was booked that evening.It was not inexpensive, but we felt it was worth the money"
102,2140,"Dec 2 2007	I'm a return visitor and am not disappointed.	I am at this hotel at the moment and had been here about two years ago. I had the last time booked a basic room and was quite impressed with the hotel, specifically liking the location, free wireless, wine hour, and quality of service. This time, I took the offered upgrade to Club Level and this has made my stay even better. Unfortunately I am only spending two nights on a business trip, but I will definately return. The Club Level room is nice and spacious, with quality appointments. The access to the Club Level lounge also adds to the comfort of your stay. Service is just as good as I remember it and I am greatly enjoyin my stay.There are a few drawbacks though to keep in mind, although I am sure this will be the case at most hotels. I am on the fourth flloor facing the front street. Unfortunately I hear a lot of the street noise in my room. The windows aren't well sound-proofed and if you're a light sleeper, this can be a problem. Make sure to ask for a room not facing the street. Further, I knew to not valet park my car at the hotel as the price is outrageous. The best deal for overnight parking is the garage below Union Square. I prepared for this and checked prices at all nearby garages and the lowest overnight price is to be had there. You have to walk two blocks to the hotel but I just dropped off my luggage, checked in, and then brought the car to the garage. Nice and easy and you save 15 bucks or so a night. Well worth it. Finally, one little pet peeve of mine is the crappy gym. Although I hadn't planned on working out indoors and usually prefer to run up and down the hills nearby Union Square, I decided to work out on the 8th floor. There isn't much available in there and some of the attachments to the weight machine were broken. Everyone works out nowadays. I wish hotels would pay a bit more attention to this. Otherwise, I can highly recommend this hotel especially if you want to be in the Union Square area."
103,2140,"Nov 12 2007	great location	We stayed at the prescott for 6 days, we traveled from Ireland, and wanted some were central. This hotel has great location rooms small clean and comfortable. Mini bar expensive so give it a miss, nice bar with the lovely Brian mixing a mean margarita, we found him very informative.all staff very friendly and helpful we were happy with our choice and would saty here again.We even had th epleasure of an earthquake lol,"
104,2140,"Nov 6 2007 	Happy with The Prescott	We just stayed at The Prescott in October. The first hotel during our 2 week vacation starting in San Francisco and ending in San Diego. We have stayed at Kimpton Hotels before and have always been happy with our experience, so that is why we chose Kimpton again.We found the front desk to be friendly and happy to help us with our bags and also during our 3 night stay always helping us with whatever we needed. This is the one thing I have always found to be true in all of the Kimpton Hotels. Their staff has always been attentive to our needs.The room was pleasantly decorated, clean &amp; comfortable.My only problem was with the size of the room. When one of us was using the computer at the desk, the other had to climb over the bed to pass by. Very narrow room,We had a problem also obtaining internet service and when I called for help, help arrived within minutes and had us up &amp; running.We were very happy with the location of the hotel, central to a lot of options. The cable car turntable is only blocks away and we rode that down to Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz.Also want to mention a great little place for breakfast just blocks away, The Taylor St Coffee Shop (375 Taylor St)Wonderful breakfast, freshest &amp; large portion of fruit I have ever had. Overall we were happy with our stay here."
105,2140,"Nov 5 2007 	Nice hotel but better without the attitude	My husband checked into this hotel alone while I was at a business meeting. He was greeted with attitude from the front desk and bellman, neither of which wanted to help him. He was draped with four bags and wasn't offered any assistance with them at all. Besides that initial experience, the location and accommodations were great! We stayed on the Club level (not by request) and though it was like a maze trying to get to it (take the elevator to 4, walk down a ramp and around a corner, take another elevator to 5) the extra perks were nice (free drinks and appetizers at happy hour). We walked to Union Square and BART daily. And, the attitude disappeared once we had checked in. Concierge, restaurant staff and bellman proved to be very helpful in the end."
106,2140,"Oct 17 2007 	TINY hallways rooms elevators... get a better deal at the Westin St Francis!	Front desk service was impeccable... but for $400/night for Club Level, we were astonished by the Lilliputian size of the elevator and narrow hallways leading to our tiny, tiny room! For the same price, we had a HUGE room at the Westin St Francis with a view of Union Square Park. Even at $200/nt we would have thought the Prescott was cramped, and we travel to Europe often, (our expectations are not out of line.)"
107,2140,"Oct 14 2007	Prescott: Practically Perfect!	The Prescott Hotel was perfect for us. Two blocks from Union Square, on Post between Taylor and Mason.We stayed on Club Level, room 434 (two double beds), for $299 per night.Club Level amenities included a very nice continental breakfast available every morning from 6am to 10am (cold cereals (choice of 4), hot beverages, delicious juices, fruit, pastries, breads and bagels, toasters for self service, etc. You could have that in the nice lounge, or bring it back to your room. In the afternoon there was an open bar with a bartender, cheese and crackers, and fine quality pizza from the Postrio restaurant next door (a Wolfgang Puck enterprise.)Our room wasn't shabby,but there were a few minor signs of wear and tear, and a bellman mentioned that the hotel's rooms are being renovated bit by bit, though all were renovated in 2004, and so looked spiffier to me than the last time I'd stayed there, years before. Our room wasn't large, but it was comfortable, with plenty of space to walk around and to keep two large suitcases open. The bathroom again wasn't large, but it was functional, attractive, and immaculate. L'Occitane toiletries, great towels and bed linens. Almost all services were prompt, efficient, and helpful. One of the concierges forgot to get back to me on a dinner reservation, but I followed up on my own and no harm done. I highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again. Given S.F. hotel prices, I think this one is a bargain."
108,2140,"Oct 4 2007 	Super convenient	The Prescott Hotel is another Kimpton gem. When we arrived, they checked us in early and efficiently, upgrading us to a suite on the club level for the same price. We got to enjoy cocktails, munchies and free breakfast in the common area there. The hotel was clean and well laid out. The room had a spacious bathroom and an excellent bed with L'Occitaine products. The hotel is a convenient walk from the BART and close to shopping. Kimpton Hotels are always a good choice for travel."
109,2140,"Oct 1 2007	Expensive - but a sure thing	WE have stayed here a few times before and chose to pay the high rates to get a sure thing. There was something going on in town that made it challenging to find reasonable accommodations. In the end, we chose to pay about double the going rate to ensure a good night. We weren't disappointed."
110,2140,"Oct 1 2007 	Good Not Great	The Prescott is a very nice hotel. In many ways it is right on point, yet in other ways if falls short.Things they do well...--excellent lobby staff. Very friendly, helpful and outgoing especially Jill and Emily. The doormen are excellent in providing services including directions and an excellent price on a town car return to the airport. Check this out. It's almost the same price as a taxi and much more enjoyable.--wonderful maid service. She kept our room perfect. I would have liked a bit more attention to the bathroom but I think the staff is instructed not to touch visitor's personal items. --Very quiet--even though the hotel was full, there was no sound of slamming doors or people running in the halls. It seems a very well behaved crowd is attracted to this property.--Nice bed linens and robes in the room--perfect location. You can walk anywhereThings they need to work on...--Building mechanicals. The building is old and the air conditioning has a difficult time keeping up. It was 85* when we arrived and it took over 12 hours for the room temperature to go down 6*.---Matresses. With all the emphasis on heavenly beds, grande beds and super beds in the chain hotels, it would be important for Klimptons to keep up. Our mattress was horrible. Very thin and uncomfortable. Considering we were in a suite, it was very disappointing to have such a horrible mattress. This area really needs improvement if they plan to remain competitive.--Whirlpool tub needs to be upgraded. The jets were brown and looked moldy. The shower curtain was dirty on the bottom inside the tub.--The wine hour is nice but couldn't they spring for a couple of bowls of nuts or chips? Kind of cheap!!!!!!!!!!!! This hotel is good, not great. It has a tremendous amount of potential and a willing staff. Emphasis should be put on upgrading. Boutique hotel visitors really notice the little things."
111,2140,"Sep 26 2007 	Great boutique hotel; good value and nice experience	The Prescott is located right in the middle of the Union Square buzz in SF. It is a very nicely appointed and well kept boutique hotel. There were cookies at the front desk when we checked in. We had a one bedroom suite with a small kid and there was plenty of space for a crib in the room with a separate small living area. The only snag was that we had requested a crib trough the reservations system and they didn't have one for us in the room - thankfully, we had taken ours. Valet parking is an absurb $45 a day, but that's SF for you. The room was quiet and well furnished, with just a few chips in the paint here and there. Overall, we thought that the hotel provided good value for the money and a nice, sophisticated getaway in the City by the Bay."
112,2140,"Sep 19 2007 	Elegant Boutique in San Francisco!	The wonderful reason to experience a boutique hotel vs. chain hotels staff and the hotel goes over and beyond.Great entrance with doorman very polite, rooms are charming, it's very nice, great restaurant POSTRIO.Stayed for a week, location is just a block away from Union Square and world finest shopping.Has unique and elegant style, adds to the San Francisco travel experience.Highly recommend it!"
113,2140,"Sep 10 2007 	Great Weekend Away	Spent two nights at the Prescott. It is very charming and has a beautiful old world feel. It reminded us very much of our boutique hotel in Paris. The room was a little small, but ample, and the mirrored wall made it seem larger. The decor was tasteful and very European, and the bedding the softest I have ever felt. It was a pleasure snuggling into bed! Our room was at the back of the hotel, and while we didnt have much of a view, it was very quiet. This was especially nice since the area is quite busy at all hours. The location can't be beat - within easy walking distance of Union Square, Chinatown, dozens of restaurants and bars, and all forms of transportation. The staff was fabulous and so helpful. A special thanks to Jon the bellman who was super friendly and welcoming, and directed us to a fantastic vegetarian restaurant - the Millennium. Vegan fine dining at it's best. In my opinion, this is a very well run hotel, and we would definitely stay here again.**HINT: if you have a hybrid car, the hotel doesn't charge the $50/night parking fee. We rented a hybird and saved $$ this way."
114,2140,"Sep 10 2007	Great Base for City Visit	Stayed at The Prescott for two nights. The location near Union Square is extremely convenient for shopping around the Square and in the excellent Westfield Centre, the cable cars along Powell towards Fisherman's Wharf and Muni along Market towards Embarcadero.The staff were friendly and efficient providing information, printing out boarding passes, storing luggage and providing a town car to the airport. The room was not large but the furnishings, bedding and bathroom were all of a high standard.We would readily stay at The Prescott again"
115,2140,"Aug 24 2007 	Charming little European style hotel	This little boutique hotel was perfect. The room was small but tastefully decorated, very clean and definitely had the feel of an upscale European hotel. The concierge staff was incredibly friendly, warm and helpful, and the wine hour each night in the lounge was a really nice perk. The entire staff was friendly and welcoming during our whole 4 night stay. The location (less than 2 blocks from Union Square) was ideal and convenient to everything. I've stayed in numerous hotels of this type in San Francisco over the years, and this is the one I'd definitely return to,"
116,2140,"Aug 20 2007 	Quiet Inside Room Good Service	We stayed here for several nights for a wedding in July 07. All in all our group took up 50-60 rooms. First, a warning -- do not exceed the recommended number of people in the elevator. 10 of the guests were trapped for about 30 minutes when they exceeded the weight limit (by a lot) after the rehearsal dinner. The front desk was not super responsive and finally someone called the SF fire department directly from their cell phone. This elevator (1 of 2) was &quot;out of order&quot; for about 3 more days, which was a minor inconvenience. Our room was irregular shaped and well appointed. Wireless internet worked well. We did not have a view because this was an inside room, but on the flip side the street noise was very minimal. Housekeeping was very efficient. The hotel restaurant, Postrio, is very good. Breakfast belgian waffles and homemade jam to die for. The cafe/bar has a nice small menu for lunch featuring salads, a sandwich or two, and a shrimp dish. Postrio catered an &quot;afterparty&quot; for the wedding group and the food was delicious comfort type food, perfect for late night. One note for large groups at this hotel -- there are two different towers, and to get from one to the other to visit relatives sometimes requires two elevator rides plus some stairs. Not a big deal for me, but could be problem for some. The second tower has a concierge level -- which has continental breakfast, happy hour, comfy couches, and a computer. The concierge service was very good, even finding last minute tickets to Jersey Boys and reserving rental cars to be delivered directly to the hotel for drives up to Napa. A few blocks from Union Square, the Prescott is definitely worth considering for your visit to SF!"
117,2140,"Aug 12 2007 	Prescott is tops in SF	This was out first visit to SF so I was looking for a small hotel near Union Square and the Prescott fit the bill. The service was superb, the room nicely appointed and clean. The view left a little to be desired but we weren't there to sit in the room. It is convenient to Union Square, China Town, Cable Cars and all the major stores. The wine Happy hour at the end of every day was a nice touch and certainly helped us relax after a day of touring.The restaurant, which is one of Wolfgang Pucks offered you the choice of a full sit down dinner or a pizza in the bar area, both of which were good. A previous reviewer said the Granola breakfast was worth trying and I have to agree. It is made on site and is a great way to start the day.Check In and Check Out were both hazzle free and as I mentioned above all of the staff were very helpful and courteous. Last but not least the bed was great. We would definitely stay here again."
118,2140,"Aug 8 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel Near Union Square	Stayed at Prescott in Club Level every time we come to SF for last 10 yrs as our daughter lives in SF. Some rooms are not large, but had a large room this time on 4th floor. Service was excellent, as always, even though hotel was fully booked due to baseball all-star game taking place during the time that we stayed there.. There is a separate concierge on the Club Level in addition to concierge in main lobby. Both were very helpful with dinner &amp; theatre reservations. Wolfgang Puck's excellent Postrio Restaurant is located in the hotel &amp; hotel guests have inside track on getting reservations. Free continental breakfast &amp; full happy hour with Wolfgang Puck pizza in the afternoon &amp; full complimentary bar. It is a short walk to Union Square, MOMA &amp; art galleries, theatres. We arrived early before rooms were ready &amp; checked bags. When we came back later in day the bags were already in the room, rather than in the storage area. Could use upgrade to flat screen TVs."
119,2140,"Jul 18 2007 	Loved the Prescott!	We found this hotel on trip advisor as the reviews were so good. This was our first visit to San Fran had a lovely time and would def go back!The hotel was clean, the staff friendly and the beds so very, very, comfortable!Definitely a must!"
120,2140,"Jul 7 2007 	Would definitely go back!	We adored the Prescott! We had a room overlooking nothing special unless you like brick walls but we were there to enjoy the comforts not the view particularly. We had an end room so no disturbance from anyone and the room itself was beautifully presented and made us feel quite special. The staff were very friendly and courteous and the living room where tea and coffee was provided with a roaring fire and very comfy leather chairs was a stop every morning on our way out. Very close to Union Square and only a 10 min walk to the cable car stop which takes you right to Fisherman's Wharf (quite long queues and allow extra time for the extra queue to buy your ticket - you can buy single tickets on board but day passes are better value). The Hotel restaurant gets very busy as it seems very popular with non residents and the food and service were both excellent. We would definitely stay at the Prescott again for it's locality, friendly staff, clean rooms, and exceptionally comfortable beds!"
121,2140,"Jun 27 2007 	Prescott Hotel - A great experience	Made this reservation for a friend. He reported that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. The location is superb and convention to great shopping, restaurants &amp; night life."
122,2140,"Jun 20 2007	Prescott Hotel - Location and style	Just returned from an 8 day vacation in beautiful San Francisco. We stayed at the Prescott and were completely satisfied. The location, a block from Union Square, made it easy to walk to Chinatown, Financial District, the Cable Car turnaround, and all of the department stores. The hotel room was comfortable for the two of us, bathroom toiletries(L'Occitane) were amply provided as were bathrobes and umbrellas (which we didn't need as the weather was fabulous). The room had no view but the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Our laptop fit in the safe. All of the employees were friendly with a greeting and smile whenever encountered. The concierge made dinner reservations, shuttle reservations, and provided detailed instructions to get us from the Legion of Honor Museum to Nob Hill. We enjoyed the wine hour from 5 to 6 on a couple of occasions which was held in a large livingroom area with a fireplace. Coffee and tea were provided there in the morning as well. The Prescott is a well managed boutique hotel and we will stay there again when we return to San Francisco."
123,2140,"Jun 13 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel in SFO	Stayed here in mid-March for 3 nights. We booked our stay through Priceline so I was expecting to receive a low end room. Our room was by the elevator but there was never any excessive noise that bothered us. The rooms were small but nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable for us. Free coffee in the mornings and free wine in the evenings was also a nice touch and a reason that I always look for a Kimpton first when I travel. The concierge (whose name eludes me right now) was VERY helpful with all of our needs. Whether it was finding a good pizza place at 11PM (we arrived late), recommending and making dinner reservations, or sending somebody around the corner to CVS to get medicine for my g/f when she got sick...she definitely went out of her way to help us out. I can't wait to return to SFO and this lovely hotel"
124,2140,"May 28 2007 	Wanted to love it but disappointed	We arrived in San Francisco after a long flight from Sydney, Australia. We got to the hotel at about 10am - we didn't expect our room to be ready, but we were rather surprised by the indifferent reception from the staff at the front desk. We were allowed to leave our luggage, but were told 'go for a walk' until 3pm. It would have been nice to be offered a drink, or even a map with advice on the best places to visit. Our room was small but quite well appointed - the bed was good. Our view was of airconditioning plants and rubbish, but we were in the room to sleep, not stare out the window. Unfortunately the indifferent service returned when we asked about tours to Alcatraz - we were advised that we should walk to the pier, which would take about 25minutes, and ask if tickets were available. The concierge advised us that she had rung earlier this morning for other guests, and there were only a few tickets left so we might be disappointed. We were quite annoyed that she didn't see fit to call on behalf of us. The final annoyance came when we needed to check out at 5.45 am - we took our bags downstairs to encouter a very friendly cleaner, but yet more indifference from the staff at the front desk. We had to interrupt their discussions about tiresome guests to ask if we could check out - the person we spoke to said he couldn't help and then just walked away. We assumed he was going to get someone who could, but he walked outside to chat to someone in the street. We stood there for about 15 minutes before someone else wandered by. The Prescott is in a great location - we wanted to love it, but the combination of the poor service and slightly shabby interiors made for a frustrating stay."
125,2140,"May 12 2007	Somebody update this place ASAP!	From the furniture with ripped fabric in the lobby to dirty (as in food or something) caked on the chairs in my room I can't figure out why this potentially great hotel is not taking care of itself. Add to this outdated phones of horrible quality (I had to take a business call and no one could me hear on the other end), dirty doors, broken fixtures and the like in the suite. What was interesting is that they were doing touch up painting on the walls of the hallway but clearly not investing in anything else. AVOID the workout room -- it's pathetic and an embarrassment to the Kimpton brand. The Club Level lounge is nice and lots of free drinks and carbs await you, if you want those things. Bottom line-great location but wouldn't recommend to anyone until major overhaul is done."
126,2140,"May 11 2007 	The Prescott is Great	The Prescott is great especially since we got our room for $135 per night via a Priceline bid. My only request was a quiet room and that was what we got in the very back of the hotel. The room was small but two people could move around at the same time. The furnishings were appropriate for a 4 star hotel, simple but tastefull. My only non-positive comment about the room was that you have to be something of a contortionist to reach the toilet paper roll while seated but that is a mild complaint. The hotel had complementary coffee and tea in their &quot;living room&quot; area off of the lobby every morning and complementary wine and beer in the late afternoons. We tried the attached Wolfgang Puck restaurant (Postrio) for dinner one night. It was expensive but the food was non-impressive. The flavors were so subtle that you barely tasted anything in either of the two dishes that my husband and I ordered. On the positive side the service was very good. We didn't have time to search for a place for breakfast the day we left so we went back to Postrio (how bad could cereal be?). We were pleasantly surprised that the granola, hot oatmeal, and fresh fruit plates were all excellent.The only other negative of note was the disco music that was played in the elevator at 7:00 am. I was just not in the mood for this before my morning coffee. A more relaxing music in the mornings please.And of course how could you beat the wonderful location one block from Union Square. All in all we would love to go back to the Prescott (especially if we can get it through a Priceline bid)."
127,2140,"Apr 30 2007 	Very nice at the right price	Booked a room here on Priceline for $125; at that price, this is a steal. Excellent location (1 1/2 blocks from Union Square), very stylish design that has retained some of the feel of an old building. Room was on the smallish side, but perfectly adequate. Only complaint was weakish water pressure."
128,2140,"Apr 21 2007	Big Disappointment!	I stayed at the Prescott last year and found the Club Level room comfortable but small. Enjoyed the Club Level amenities and the friendly staff as well as how easy it was to meet other guests during breakfast and cocktail hour. Last week, I was excited when told we had been upgraded to the &quot;penthouse suite&quot; instead of the Club Level room we booked. Well, the suite was big but that was where it ended. The decor was rundown, the upper hinge of the bathroom door was hanging loose, the upholstery of the sofa and chairs was soiled and the furniture was &quot;shabby chic&quot;, with emphasis on the shabby. We got immediate response to the complaint about the door, but how did it get missed by the maid when she cleaned prior to our stay? That said, the bed and bedding was excellent as it always is in Kimpton Hotels, but boy, am I glad I wasn't paying the full price for that room!"
129,2140,"Apr 16 2007 	The Prescott is a Winner	My partner and I (two women) had an excellent five-night stay at the Prescott Hotel in San Francisco during our vacation in early April 2007. We read a favorable review of the Prescott through Karen Brown's travel guide and booked a &quot;deluxe level queen&quot; room for $199 per night, not including $28 for taxes.The hotel's location near Union Square, the Powell Street cable car turnaround and municipal railway and BART station appealed to us. We were also within walking distance of Nob Hill and SF MOMA, the art museum. Coit Tower in Little Italy and the Ferry Building's food bazaar at the foot of Market Street can be reached in 20-minute walk.Our room, #417, on the fourth floor executive level, had a window overlooking Post Street, which was quiet and sunny. I recommend asking for a room overlooking Post Street, rather than the interior of the hotel, which faces the backsides of buildings. Across from the Prescott on Post Street is a quiet, established private club, the Olympic Club -- no noise. Our room was furnished with attractive dark wood furniture, soft luxury bed linens and high-end soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. There was adequate dresser and closet space for us to store our clothes. The bathroom is designed well: good counter space and lighting, extra towels and a spacious shower area with a nice size ledge to sit on when bathing or shaving legs. The room was cleaned well each day and bathroom supplies were replenished. Upon request, shoes will be shined overnight at no charge.Internet access was available in our room, but we did not have computer with us. A desktop PC is available for guests to use in the club level lounge on the 4th floor, but you must use your credit card to obtain access. I felt that access to the club lounge computer should be provided at no charge as a courtesy to guests.There is a small gym at the hotel, but I didn't visit it.In the morning, we enjoyed indulging in the complimentary pastries, muffins, coffee and fruit served in the roomy and well decorated &quot;executive level club&quot; lounge on the fourth floor of hotel. The furniture and atmosphere is very comfortable. Newspapers (NYT, WSJ, Financial Times and SF Chronicle) are available for guests. Families with children, couples and businesspeople all share the club area. In the late afternoon, the club level serves complimentary drinks and snacks, e.g. cheese, bread and small pizza slices.There is concierge's desk in the hotel lobby and on the executive club level (4th floor). Erica, one of the concierge's offered to book our airport shuttle (done!) and print our airline boarding passes. I liked her initiative, especially her comparison of booking a reservation to the SF Airport on Super Shuttle vs. Lorrie's, another service. Lorrie's has a live person answering their phone reservation, which isn't always the case with Super Shuttle. We paid $15 each to travel to the airport on Lorrie's. The van arrived ten minutes before our 6:00 a.m. reservation to depart from the hotel on a Sunday morning, which was fine with us. My only complaint about the Prescott was not being able to settle the bill the night before our departure. We were told we could check out using our TV set after midnight (Argh) or wait until the morning of departure (before our 6:00 a.m. airport shuttle). The bill I was given on the Sunday morning we departed had the room charges for that day, which should not have appeared. Fortunately, I caught this mistake and the bill was reissued.Transportation to the Prescott:We took BART from the SFO Airport to the Powell Street station when we arrived in San Francisco around 3:00 p.m. on a weekday. The fare was about $5.25 per person, the ride was comfortable and took about 20 minutes from the BART terminal at the airport -- easy to get to BART from the main part of the airport terminal via the free, local airport train. Safe and clean. Transportation in SF:We recommend buying an unlimited ride passport to use San Francisco's municipal transit system (Muni). The visitor's center next to the Powell Street BART/Muni station sells Muni passports. We paid $18 each for a three-day pass. It was great to flash our pass while others paid $5 per each-way on the cable car. We also used the local bus, muni trolley on Market Street and the muni railway. Muni buses and railways are $1.50 per trip without a pass."
130,2140,"Apr 14 2007 	Gotta love Kimpton!	With Priceline my best friend and I got a great deal for our mini spring break destination! We chose the Prescott because we love Kimpton hotels. I noticed that Kimpton has many hotels in SF, all in great locations. The Prescott is just one short black from Union Square, which is full of restuarants, cafes, and shopping! The cable cars are right there as well.The rooms are roomy, EXTREMELY comfy beds! Soft down sheets, and pillows. Great concierge! She printed out different menus from the local restaurants, we went to Filos which is right across the street! Fantastic italian! In the evening they serve great wines, and drinks. Plus delicious chocolate chip cookies at the front desk! Kimpton hotels are wonderful for there price, and creative, friendly enviroments."
131,2140,"Apr 11 2007 	Overated for me	End of March, I was staying at the Marriott on 4th St. which I would recommend, and stay at again. Clean, updated, modern design and good location. I switched to the Prescott at the recommendations of friends. It was once very nice but needs to be touched up and really cleaned. It reminds me of European hotels that have an old world feel, which is nice if the hotel is top notch. Also, the heating and air conditioning system is strange, once it reached the room temperature you program, it switches to air conditioning to maintain it. So we could never get the room to be comfortable. Most of the staff was excepionally nice. Samll exercise room but adequate. The location is fine, about 3 blocks from Union Square, next to the Postrio restaurant, which gives guests preference seating/reservations. With my experience at the Marriott, which was about 40 dollars more per night, I doubt I would stay here again. (P.S. I travel a fair amount for business &amp; pleasure)."
132,2140,"Mar 15 2007 	Loved the Prescott!	We stayed here to do the &quot;Bay to Breakers.&quot; Perfect location, very comfortable and a friendly staff. We actually drove to Freemont and took Bart into the city. Got off at Nordstrom's and took an easy walk to the hotel...no parking hassels! Can't wait for the next time."
133,2140,"Mar 13 2007 	Fantastic Hotel and Staff	After 3 weeks traveling around Australia we were looking forward to our stop over in San Fran and we weren't disappointed.The Prescott is a gorgeous hotel, in a fantastic location and has the best staff of any hotel Ive stayed out.The concierge and the bell staff (especially Michael) were excellent and really helpful nothing at all was too much trouble from recommending places to go, booking dinner and sorting out theatre tickets.Anyone staying here needs to visit the bar, not wanting to sound like a saddo, but sitting in the bar you get the feeling you're in an American sitcom  Brian the bartender was great.Definitely stay here on a trip to San Francesco"
134,2140,"Mar 8 2007 	Prescott is great	We had an awesome 4 night stay at the Prescott! We have two kids 3 and 7 who really had a great time, too. The executive club level breakfast and happy hour were fantastic and kid friendly. The snacks at happy hour were amazing. The staff is really nice and even helped us order a pizza from a local pizzeria for a dinner in the room. The location was good because it's not directly on Union Square so it's not too noisy but it's a 2 minute walk so it's convenient for cable car rides, etc."
135,2140,"Mar 4 2007	Good for yoga	I stayed here for three nights whilst passing through San Francisco to business elsewhere in the US. I was attracted to the hotel by it's location and it having yoga kits and a yoga channel. The location was also good for a solo woman.I had a Queen Deluxe room on floor 6 overlooking Post Street. The room was easily large enough to accommodate yoga practice with only minimal moving of furniture. The yoga kit provided consisted of a mat, belt and block, all in a new condition. Unfortunately the yoga channel (32) was showing cookery programmes. The considerable mirroring in the room helped me to improve my postures though. The room itself was nice; neutral decor, comfortable bed, quality linens. Movies were $9.99. Bath products were L'Occitane rather than the advertised Aveda but I prefer them so it made little difference.Although I did not use the concierge service I did see Amanda going the distance in trying to obtain tickets for shows. The staff were pleasant and seemed good at responding to the different needs of guests. I endorse the comment about the MUNI pass, $18 for three days unlimited travel on buses, cablecars and trolley buses.San Francisco was a fantastic place for a short stopover, the different neighbourhoods provided different pleasures. If I stayed again I would probably stay in a different area but the location was great for a first visit; close to transport links, shopping, theatres and restaurants."
136,2140,Feb 2 2007	Like very much	Really a delightful hotel. Nicely appointed rooms with wonderful beds. Charming and small boutique feel. Nice location.
137,2140,"Jan 22 2007	A cozy unique spot - close to everything you need	A friend and I enjoyed a girls' getaway weekend in San Francisco and really enjoyed our time at the Prescott. The room was pretty small, but we were totally expecting that in a small, boutique 100 year old hotel. The Aveda bath products were great - as were the bed linens - the duvets really made me feel like I was in Europe.The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. The concierge desk was helpful too, but we didn't require much advice - having already done most of our research on where to eat, etc.The location can't be beat - you are close to the cable car lines and bus stops - I highly recommend the MUNI passes - get yourself a MUNI map too and it is so easy (and cheap) to get around the city. We only took one cab during our 5 day stay. The rest of the time it was busss (or cable cars if they were convient and not full!) Also, you can take the BART from SFO or Oakland and it is a short walk to the Prescott - a bargain for around $7Make a point to enjoy the lovely meeting area during wine hour. It is also a nice place to sit and chat with your group and with others."
138,2140,"Jan 15 2007	Unbelievable value	I have been here for almost 3 weeks on business. Kimpton quality as others have stated for anywhere between $121-149 (AAA) rate. Free wine hour from 5-6, but I have to admit I am enjoyin the club level wine and apps even though I am not on club level. Staff extremely helpful. 10 good restaurants within 2 blocks and union square. Avis and Hertz 2 blocks away also in the event you only need car for 1 day and don't want to pay $40 overnight parking charge. Attached to swanky restaurant Postrio which has a reasonable and convenient bar menu."
139,2140,"Jan 14 2007 	Outstanding Hotel in Union Square Area!	This is a fabulous hotel. It has a very elegant feel, is upscale with a wonderful staff from the reception desk to the concierge to the bellman.We booked two rooms for our stay, a deluxe king suite and a deluxe queen room. We are Kimpton In Touch members and were upgraded to the Club level for both rooms. I've read reviews saying the rooms were small but I did not find that to be the case with either room. The suite has a separate room with a pull out sofa with a small dining table with two chairs. Five people sat comfortably in the room in the evening enjoying a bottle of champagne.The rooms are well maintained and very comfortable. I particularly enjoy rooms with overhead lighting in the ceiling. The rooms here have overhead lights in each room including both suite rooms. The rooms also had large walk in closets, a rarity these days in hotel rooms.My favorite part of the room was how quiet it was. The rooms did not have a view; our suite looked out to a concrete wall but I 'll take that any day in a big city. No street noise, not city noise, I never slept better in a city hotel room. I'm sure some of the rooms face the street but based on the design of what I could tell most of the rooms at the Prescott face away from the street since it is in the middle of a block so most rooms should be very quiet.The Club Level was nicely done. The evening featured complimentary wine, beer, some hard liquor and soft drinks. A variety of bread and cheeses along with Wolfgang Puck Pizzas were served. The morning featured cereals, fruit, bagels, muffins, fresh orange juice, coffee and tea. We thoroughly enjoyed it.The hotel is only one block from the Curran Theater which makes it very convenient for Theater goers. The only slightly negative comment is the TV's in the room are old 20&quot; Zenith models that need to be updated and they should replace the VCR's with DVD players. I'm sure this will be coming in the future.We've stayed in many hotels in the Union Square area of San Francisco. The Prescott is by far our favorite. We will absolutely return."
140,2140,"Jan 10 2007 	Loved it!	Loved this hotel! We were on the Club Level and our room was smallish but gorgeous. Neutral colous scheme, big comfy bed, nice quality bedlinen and large bathroom.In the afternoon they had a cocktail hour, with free drinks and nibbles. Divine!!!"
141,2140,"Dec 30 2006 	Fantastic hotel experience	I stayed 3 nights at the Prescott on business in early December 2006. When I arrived to check-in, I was upgraded to a 2-room suite on the executive level of the hotel. (The clerk simply said it was my &quot;lucky day&quot;.) The room was large, immaculate, and came with nice club level amenities like free continental breakfast and evening reception, shoe shine, high-quality toiletries, etc. The staff was uniformly pleasant from the housekeepers to the general manager. Union Square is 1.5 blocks away and it's a 5 minute walk to the MBTA Powell St station. I travel a fair bit, and there's no question that my stay at the Prescott was a great hotel experience all around."
142,2140,"Dec 30 2006	Excellent hotel. Kimpton has another winner!	We are staying here from Dec 28 to Jan 1, 2007. It's a great little hotel. The rooms is excellent, with nice linens, towels and comfy bed. Usual amenities of a 4 star hotel, iron &amp; board, minibar, safe and morning paper. Unusual was the free overnite shoe shine, 4 different newspapers and coffee in the fireside lobby lounge from 6:30 AM. The location is good too, only 2 blocks from Union Square. The staff is friendly, helpful and attentive. I highly recommend this Kimpton Hotel Group property. We have stayed at their Monaco and Vintage Plaza Hotels here in SF, and this one is the best yet."
143,2140,"Dec 26 2006	A mixed bag	The Prescott was a very nice hotel. Pretty, excellent staff, very clean. We spent four nights there the week before Christmas. We only had one major problem and that was with the HVAC. We set the thermostat for heat with a temperature of 70 and automatic fan (only when the heat came on). However, when the temperature in the room dropped below 70, the fan came on and blew cold air for, what seemed an eternity (in actuality probably at least 5 minutes), before it blew hot air. Staff told us it was an old building and HVAC system and that was the way it was - they did adjust the vent louvers away from the bed. Coffee and tea were available just off the lobby in the morning but nothing to complement it. Much better to have had a coffee machine in the room like so many other hotels rather than to have t schlep the beverages back to our room. The wine tastings between 5 and 6 PM were nice but again no complements to it and completely unattended. Stay again? Not sure."
144,2140,Nov 26 2006 	It is always great	Its safe its very clean great location WORTH BEING A KIMPTON MEMBER they offer freebiesI suggest that you ask exactly what they offer and if you can have an up grade to the club level THIS IS FANTASTIC value
145,2140,"Nov 13 2006	Great Location Nice Hotel	The Prescott Hotel is in a Great Location, Just a few blocks from Union Square.Our room was very clean, and the housekeeping service was very good indeed. The view out of the room was not one to write home about, and I agree with another guest on keeping the curtains closed at all times.I enjoyed my stay here very much, my only gripe being that I was charged for two nights Valet parking, when I only used the facility the one night. Upon checking out it took me what seemed like an age to get my Bill corrected. Apart from that it's a hotel I would recommend to anyone staying in the area."
146,2140,"Nov 8 2006 	Perfect location Pleasant staff Comfortable room	We found the Prescott by a chance internet search and when we noticed it was among the top 50 boutique hotels, we decided to give it a try. We were able to get a AAA rate (265) and although it was more than what we wanted to pay, we liked the location, the description, and, well, we were leaving in 5 days! All worth it. Plenty of space in our room, bathrobes and slippers, a very comfortable bed and spacious armoir. The deluxe continental breakfast and daily paper were great to have as part of our room rate. The fitness room was small but sufficient. The location was, in fact, very convenient and we walked all over the city and made it back for the evening wine tasting in the lobby. Others have remarked about the staff and we agree that they are top notch. Each concierge was knowledgeable, helpful, and pleasant - some pretty funny, too. And, Patricia at the front desk added those small, almost unnoticeable touches, that really helped. We wrote the manager afterward to commend everyone. One night we were too tired to dine out and the staff recommended a little Thai restaurant for take-out nearby - we ate in the lobby by the fire with a bottle of wine we picked up in Sonoma. What could be better! Stay here. We'll be looking for Kimpton hotels whenever we travel."
147,2140,"Oct 19 2006 	Charming Characteristic With Convenience	The Prescott Hotel in San Francisco definitely is a small hotel situated near Union Square. The building is about 7 floors high which doesn't have a great view at all. You will have to keep your curtain drawn for privacy. Otherwise, the people in the building next door can look through their windows to see your every move.I have heard a lot of negative feedback about the Prescott Hotel which even made me more curious to find out if the claims of previous guests are true. Because this hotel is fairly small compared to other hotels in the area, you can be guaranteed that the service provided by their staff is of the highest level possible. Some people have said that the hotel rooms are so small. True, SOME rooms are rather small. However, they also have bigger rooms, ie, Executive King Suites and more. Ever wonder why this hotel can charge a lot for a small room? BECAUSE THE PRESCOTT HOTEL IS VERY LUXURIOUS AND YOU CAN BE SURE THAT YOUR PROBLEM IS DEALT WITH EXPEDIENTLY.Just a quick tip: Ask for Patricia at the front desk. She is very professional and she makes sure that your issue gets resolved immediately. The other Asian front desk clerk needs more training. She has no customer service skill. She had me standing right in front of her while she answer the phone, and when she is done with the phone she starts calling someone on her walkie talkie and answers another phone call and carried on another conversation through her walkie talkie. I was standing in front of her for a good 20 minutes without talking to me.When Patricia saw me waiting, she immediately helped me with my request and inquiry. It only took a couple of minutes.Overall, my experience at the Prescott hotel was above average. All the other extra amenities made my hotel stay very nice. I will definitely stay at the Prescott Hotel again. THANKS TO PATRICIA."
148,2140,"Oct 10 2006 	Incredible Gem	We stayed at the Prescott 5 days with 2 other couples on business and fell in love with this charming boutique hotel. The accommodations were well appointed, comfortable and convenient. Every single employee greeted us with smiles and helpful suggestions for dining, sightseeing or anything we required. Mike, the doorman, knows everything about wine and had Brian, the bartender let me sample his suggestions....marvelous. Erica and Amanda were incredible concierges...no task too large or too small. The wine hour by the fireplace in the livingroom afforded a lovely time to meet fellow travelers and unwind. Ask Brian to make you a Ginger Mojo and enjoy!!! Whenever we return to San Fran, this is definitely where we'll stay."
149,2140,"Oct 5 2006 	Prescott's a charming hotel	Great place to stay in San Francisco. It was within walking distance to Union Square, Powell cable cars, Chinatown. We even walked to North Beach, but that was further. There are many restaurants in the area as well.We stayed in a Queen deluxe room. To our surprise, around the corner from the main bedroom, was another smaller room with a twin bed. I think the room was a good size for San Francisco standards. There was a CD player, minibar, TV, 2 writing desks.They also had free wireless service. The bed was comfortable, and there is nightly turndown service which was nice.Adjacent to the lobby, they've got a cozy, good sized sitting area complete with fireplace and reading lamps. In the mornings, there is free Starbucks coffee. Afternoons, there is free wine.Great hotel. We would stay there again."
150,2140,"Oct 2 2006 	The Prescott San Fransisco Charming and Gracefull	My wife and I go to San Fransisco several times a year. We even honeymooned there thirty one years ago. We had not had the pleasure of staing at the Prescott before this last weekend. We were very pleasantly surprised at the experience of a small intimate charming older boutique hotel. The staff was very attentive from the doormand to the bellmand and the front desk. The special ammenities such as wine in the lounge in the evening, coffee tea and a morning paper, as well as wireless internet access made the experience easy and comfortable. An Oasis af calm in the teaming jungle of Union Square. Great job to the Prescott staff . We will be back!"
151,2140,"Sep 19 2006 	Good Hotel in Central Location	I stayed at the Prescott for two nights at the end of August. It is located just off Union Square, making it a great location for business and leisure travellers. I was stopping over on the way to Australia from Toronto, and found the hotel a cozy place for a layover. While some guests have had issues with room service, there is a great selection of restaurants of all classes nearby and the concierge is more than helpful with dining, sightseeing and shopping suggestions. Be prepared to be persistent with any special requests (it was a bit difficult to get non-feather bedding due to allergies) and also note that the Kimpton chain routinely charges your card for your entire stay plus $100 a night when checking in. Coming from Canada, I found the service at times from staff (other than the concierge who was just great), a bit brisk and lacking warmth, but overall enjoyed my stay."
152,2140,"Sep 6 2006 	What a wonderful spot to stay.	We saw the reviews and decided to try The Prescott on the last part of my California vacation with my wife. We were there for 3 days, and can only rave about this place. From the moment we stopped the rental car to drop off the luggage and check in, to the time we left and needed a cab to the airport, everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The room, though small as people have noted, was large enough, very nicely kept, fresh linens, everything immaculately clean. The front desk was both friendly and efficient throughout, but I must save my most effusive comments for the best concierge - Michelle. She suggested great shows we could see, the best restaurants in the area (great food, reasonable prices) and great ways to tour the city again. She offered a smile and a welcome each time we returned to the hotel, it was as if she lived there and was our host. We had a great quick meal our first evening at Postrio's bar, and returned there for drinks one evening after a show. What a well run establishment! The location of The Prescott is ideal for anywhere in downtown San Francisco - near theatres, shopping, Union Square, the trolley and the cable car. This will be our pied-a-terre in San Francisco from now on. For a big city hotel (small as it may be) I have never felt so &quot;at home&quot; as I did here."
153,2140,"Sep 2 2006	What a GREAT hotel	I have been visiting San Francisco for 10 years and since a few years, through a recommendation from a collegue, i stay at the Prescott. What a GREAT place to stay. If you like smaller and more 'family' style hotels, the Prescott is your choice.The rooms are great, have a nice classic atmosphere and the restaurant attached to it (Postrio) is great! Very friendly personell, close to Union Square and free internet access (wireless) are jsut a few of the reasons why I LOVE this hotel.Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."
154,2140,"Aug 31 2006 	Try a different hotel	I stayed one night during a business trip at the Prescott. It's worn down and could use some extra cleaning and customer service training for it's staff.The blanket and comforter still had their small laundry slips stapled on the edge and the blanket had not been laundered in 2 months and the comforter in 1 month. The sheets had tears and rips. The air vent had cobwebs. The phone needed to be repaired and I was unable to order a movie because the service was down. At the Club level they advertise appetizers from their famous &quot;Postrio&quot; restaurant but instead a cheese tray and slices of pizza margherita are on the menu-this is very misleading since these extras determine if prospective guests will choose to pay extra for the amenites offered at the Club level. Most disappointing of all was that the staff did not appear to have any customer service training and my complaint was met with disdain as if dealing with customer concerns was not an important part of their job. Quality control wise at least guests should be able to expect sheets without holes, frequent laundry service and attentive customer service. I think with the wide range of hotels available in San Francisco there is no reason to give this one a chance."
155,2140,"Aug 28 2006 	Excellent Stay at the Prescott	After a very long cross country trip, we gratefully checked in to the beautiful Prescott Hotel. We stayed in a king suite in the back of the hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very quiet. The hotel offers yoga kits to borrow and has a TV channel with yoga instruction- great after a long, cramped trip.The room was beautifully furnished and the mini bar was stocked with every item you could need, very reasonably priced. (EG a 1.5L bottle of water for $4) The staff was welcoming and professional.The evening wine reception was held in a beautiful room just off the lobby. It was a terrific way to unwind. In the morning, I went to the exercise room. While I was surprised that there were no treadmills, there were elliptical machines and recumbant bikes. The room was clean and had towels, water and fresh fruit.We will absolutely stay at the Prescott again. It was very conveniently located on a lovely block right across from the JW Marriott. It was very close to the shopping of Union Square and a short walk to Chinatown."
156,2140,"Aug 22 2006	Applause For The Prescott	This will be my third time staying in a Kimpton Hotel. My children ages 13 &amp; 15 had never been to San Francisco so for a mini weekend getaway before school starts back we drove up from Los Angeles. The Prescott is 2 short blocks away from Union Square in the Heart of San Francisco and a few blocks from the Powell St/Hyde Cable Car, and of course wonderful shopping. We had a BLAST!! We stayed in a Junior Suite, arrived late Friday night and were so pleased to have the beds turned down with a welcome note and chocolates on the beds. The hotel is beautifully boutique in style and size and has lovely contemporary/classic furnishings throughout. Beds are incredibly cozy, (kids said even the pull out bed was comfortable), complimentary continental breakfast for Club Level members was nice on the 4th floor, and the staff is sooooooo nice and knowledgable. What I love is that it is close to everything. I have never had a bad stay at a Kimpton Hotel and I highly recommend your next trip to one of their locations!! Keep in mind that if you are looking for large rooms, boutique hotels may not be for you, however the suites are very nice in size and comfort!"
157,2140,"Jul 18 2006 	Great spot for business or personal travel	We used the Prescott for a meeting with travellers coming from many spots in the US and Canada. The location, just a quick walk from Union Square, was excellent. The concierge and front desk service were wonderful - they made great recommendations on where to go for dinner and how to get to various locations. The room was small but very clean and comfortable. Great bed, lovely linens. Nice Aveda lotions and shampoo in the bathroom. A little noise early in the evenings, but overall the location was quiet. Turn down service at night was like magic -- and a lovely touch that they left the radio playing something to relax by. All our travellers stayed on the 4th floor &quot;Club Level&quot;. The Club Level entitles you to a complimentary breakfast that was quite good. Pastries, bagels &amp; croissant, cereal, beautiful fresh fruit, juice and really drinkable coffee. For those not on the Club level there is a daily Manager's wine reception for all guests on the first floor next to the lobby. The surprize for us is that the Club level includes a complimentary evening cocktail reception with a full bar -- not just wine. Really a nice touch. The Club level was warm and offered our group a good chance to relax and mingle. They also serve limited appetizers from Postrio restaurant (downstairs in the same building) at no extra charge at the Club Level reception. Our conference room was well set-up, and the staff responded with ease to help us out with several last minute requests for AV equipment. We ordered box lunches for the meeting -- all food service comes through Postrio. The lunches got mixed reviews -- some people liked them, some people didn't. The hotel service throughout the day to stock beverages and check on our needs was unobtrusive.Just a few things to watch for...especially if you are working with a group booking. #1 -- Group sales are apparently rolled under a consolidated Kimpton booking management team. The hand-offs for handling our group booking were pretty rough at first. When we initially started working with the hotel the response was extremely slow to get any information. Ultimately I worked with a wonderful woman who followed up closely at every step to make sure we were taken care of (thanks, Julie!.) So you may need to be persistent to get their attention, but it is worth the effort! I do a lot of event planning and had nothing but solid raves about this location. #2 - Check your confirmation information from the hotel really closely. After we signed the contract and provided rooming lists there were errors on the arrival and departure dates that we got back from the hotel. Even though our contract was quite clear about the start and end dates and how many rooms we anticipated there were still errors in the booking system when we arrived that showed one of our travellers arriving a day before we'd contracted rooms! So read the paperwork closely! #3 - On checkout the hotel had added valet parking to my billing...and we didn't even have a car! They quickly cleared the charges as we checked out, but that was a surprizing error. Also, our minibar was fully stocked -- but some items had been opened which made us worry we would be charged. There was no price list in the room, but those items are usually overpriced. The minibar worries were needless...we were not charged for a thing.For this meeting I also worked with Postrio -- the Wolfgang Puck restaurant downstairs -- for a group breakfast. Their Patio Room was a private dining dream. The food selections are a bit fancy &amp; fruity, but the service was stellar!"
158,2140,"Jul 5 2006	Fabulous Stay	Had a wonderful 5 day/4 night stay at the Prescott exploring San Francisco. Friendly attentive staff ( the desk man that greeted us has been there for 17 years!) Superb location. Very reasonably priced with comfortable (small in the European style) rooms and a superb sitting area with a roaring fire going all day, inexpensive internet access (I left my puter at home), and lots of comfortable seating along with coffee and tea service in the morning and a wine hour in the afternoon.We ate at La Scala, the Farallon, Post Trios and Le Colonial, all superb restaurants within a block and a half of the hotel. Union Square is only a block and a half away. A must do is breakfast at Sears on Powell just a block up from Union Square. A SF institution for over a 100 years. Be prepared for a line, but it is worth it.You don't need a car (in fact it will get in your way in SF).Enjoy!"
159,2140,Jun 21 2006	It was okay at best	Pros:Friendly serviceNice location near Union SquareCons:-Does not offer a cheap breakfast...you can only get items from Wolfgang Pucks which was really expensive ($30-$40 for breakfast)-Only has 4 king beds in the entire hotel-Small rooms
160,2140,"Jun 20 2006	Great stay at the Prescott	Great location! 5 minutes to Union Square and cable cars. Gorgeous room with very comfy bed. (Room was small, but so nice that it didn't seem to matter.) Complimentary wine reception from 5 to 6 pm was pleasant. Free wi-fi was awesome! Room 601 was larger than some of the other rooms. I got this classy hotel on Priceline for $76 and could not have been happier! Friendly, helpful staff."
161,2140,"May 30 2006	Wonderful stay at the Prescott	I had a wonderful stay at the Prescott this past weekend. We arrived on Thursday at 11 a.m. and although no rooms were available, they did hold our luggage which allowed us to walk around the city prior to checking in. We came back at 1:30 p.m. and they had a room ready on their club level so they upgraded us for no charge! The room was small but cozy and the bathroom was large enough to walk around with 2 people. The staff was always friendly, especially when enjoying the free yummy continental breakfast and &quot;open bar&quot; and pizza in the afternoon. One nice touch is coming back to our room in the evening to see our beds made, music playing, and the room cleaned again. The front desk/concierge were helpful and helped us make reservations for dinner (which was great) and places to go. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is using their airport shuttle service (but that's another story and has nothing to do with the hotel).Overall, the Prescott was great and at a perfect location. The cable car stops at Post/Powell Street which is only 1 1/2 blocks away. The Muni/Bart is about 3-4 blocks away.I would definitely stay here again!"
162,2140,"May 29 2006 	Charming Boutique Hotel; Very Limited Room Service; A Little Sloppy	I've stayed at the Prescott a number of times for work (once for more than a week). It is a charming boutique hotel. Nicely decorated. The rooms are done traditionally in dark green and burgundy. They are somewhat small, but charming. I switched to the Pan Pacific (now the JWMarriott) across the street, however, mainly because the room service menu is extrremely limited and the dishes downright odd. The hotel is serviced by the restaurant Postria, which is downstairs; and the cuisine is what's called &quot;California Eclectic.&quot; So if you like Lamb Andouille Sausage Pizza and Beet Salad for a late night snack when you've just flown in from New York, you might like this. It wasn't for me. Breakfast was served very slowly (in room) and cold on occasion. Just not good when you're rushing to meetings and such.I wanted to like this hotel, because it's a charming, high end of the mid-range boutique -- which I prefer -- but after repeated stays, the room service killed me.The staff was always pleasant, though on occasion a little empty-headed. Once I left my credit car in the bar; had asked at the reception desk, after the restaurant was closed, if it had been found; came down the next day and asked again; the desk clerk routed around and then found an evelope in a drawer with my name on it, with my card inside. You'd think someone would have left me a messsage in my room to tell me it had been found. It's that little bit of lack of attention to what really matters -- while making sure you get lovely chocolates on your pillow and a signed welcome note from the manager, both of which you really don't care about -- that finally turned me off to this hotel."
163,2140,"May 28 2006	A Decent Place but not at the Price	While a nice hotel, for the price and its marketing as an upscale hotel, it left some to be desired - our room, upgraded to a full suite, was comfortable but lacked a full bar fridge and at that, it was not in working order - nevertheless, it was fixed promptly. Also, the bar was serviced (stocked) by a contracted group, not the hotel, so it was hardto get the type of beverages we wanted - also, the room service was done by the restaurant that, while on site, was billing seperately from the hotel - somewhat inconvenient. Location was good to Union Square and the staff was friendly and helpful."
164,2140,"May 22 2006	Nice Place to Stay	Stayed at The Prescott Hotel for 4 nights in May. Perfect location, just a couple of blocks off Powell Street and a short walk from Powell Street Station. Booked the room on Priceline where you name a price and they find a hotel, got the room for 90.00 a night. Third floor room was nicely appointed with a small seperate room with a couch/bed if needed. Never heard the first street noise. Bathroom was small without a fan so that it fogged up badly. Staff were pleasant and helpful and the nightly wine tasting which seems to common among the hotels in the city was a nice chance to relax before starting our evening. Would stay again!"
165,2140,"May 17 2006	Only if you get a good deal.	The Prescott was fine: clean, with a good staff, and nice amenities. It aspires to fancy-pants quality, which it doesn't really make. The carpet needs replacing and the place is very tiny. Do not ask the concierges for ANYTHING. They are not professionals and seem to be exchangable with the desk staff. They gave us the wrong directions twice and gave us lowsy dinner recommendations.It's got some great pluses, though. It's realy nice to pop downstairs to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant for a nip. The beds were REALLY comfortable, with memory foam mattresses and great bedding.Union Square is a great location, and it's great at night. There are tons of people around, so it never feels creepy. And the hotel is really near tons of public transportation.I wouldn't pay retail for this hotel (and certainly not the mark-up for &quot;club level&quot;), but if you get a good deal (less than $200), go for it."
166,2140,"May 15 2006	Very nice and comfortable hotel!	Spent 3 lovely days at the Prescott last March.I got a very good package deal for a 3 night stay through Luxurylink. I had a large room with plenty of amenities, very well decorated and with a confy bed with lots of confy pillows. Bathroom had excellent Aveda toiletries and , though it wasn't large, was very nice and modern. We never had breakfast at the hotel because it was a bit expensive but there was a nice place to have a good breakfast a minute up the street. The living room at the hotel was very pleasing, with a large fireplace , and wine was served in the afternoons. We had a lunch at the hotel's restaurant once and I was pleased with it. The menu doesn't offer many options but the food is good.The location of the Prescott couldn't be better, two blocks from Union Square , with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. All in all a very nice boutique hotel."
167,2140,Apr 30 2006 	an absurd price and rude manner	1. a front staff backbiting guests 2. exorbitant prices - especially international call (16$ for a minute) and internet (10$ for an hour)3. a musty room
168,2140,"Apr 27 2006	Fantastic Time!	We went to the city to attend a wedding. Found a terrific travel package at priceline.com with The Prescott as the hotel. I'm always leary shopping online for a hotel, the pics can be deceiving. In this case, they were not! We absolutely loved The Prescott and won't stay anywhere else.The location is superb, just far enough away from the fun chaos of Union Square. The room was perfect, and more than adequate. Comfy bed, great bathroom. Yeah, I'll agree the rooms are small, but like everyone else says, all older city hotel rooms are small. The staff is what you would find at a luxury resort anywhere in the U.S. and even nicer than a lot of them. No pretense whatsoever.I can't comment on noise while trying to sleep because I always wear earplugs in hotels. Why anyone wouldn't is beyond me, afterall, hotels are filled with sleeping/snoring people and those coming and going at all hours of the night. My hubby did say though that he didn't hear anything other than a small thump outside the door when they delivered the paper at some point during the morning."
169,2140,"Apr 7 2006	Fantastic Boutique Hotel	Stayed at the Prescott for several nights in March and absolutely loved it. From check-in to check-out everyone from the concierge, desk staff, to the bellmen were very genuine and helpful folks. They really seemed interested in making your stay enjoyable. The rooms are very comfortable and decorated nicely. Although people have noted that they are small, take into consideration that this is San Francisco, it is a boutique hotel, and as we found out, the building was built in 1911! Room service is from Wolfgang Puck's Postrio, who contrary to belief, still stops by every now and then to make sure the kitchen is on par. Small gym in the hotel, but they do offer day passes to Club One Fitness nearby if you really need a full facility. Wine hour in the &quot;living room&quot; is a nice touch. Overall a great place to stay, one block off of Union Square, 10 minute walk to Moscone Convention Center, very easy to get anywhere in the city. For the price paid, I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
170,2140,"Mar 30 2006	Good and Bad	Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Prescott. We arrived much earlier than the 3pm check in time, and the staff was friendly and held our bags until we returned later that afternoon. Upon check-in, we received a corner room on the second floor. The room was clean, but a little small (DISCLAIMER- we stayed at the Ritz Carlton the previous two nights, and really no hotel can compare with their rooms, services, amenities, etc). The Aveda bath products were a plus, however, we noticed that some of the wallpaper was peeling in the bathroom. The bedding was very comfortable, but unlike most hotel rooms, the t.v. stand was not placed directly across the foot of the bed, but was instead placed on the right hand side of the foot of the bed, so you had to turn your neck to watch television. Overall, the service was pretty good, however, one night we were awoken at 2 am to a very strong chemical smell. We discovered that a maintenance worker was painting a wood floorboard next to our room, and we had to call downstairs to have the problem solved. The rooms are close to each other, so we could also hear the same maintenance worker pounding and making noise with whatever tools he was using. This was very disconcerting and stressful as it was 2AM!!! I've never heard of a hotel where people do work during these sleeping hours. The smell of the lacquer or varnish which was seeping into our room gave me a headache and almost made me vomit. That said, however, the rest of our stay was pleasant. Location is convenient (couple blocks from Union Square) and we hear that their restaurant, Postrio, is very popular, although we did not try it. Overall, we probably won't stay here again."
171,2140,"Mar 28 2006	Great bang for the buck!	We got the hotel on priceline for $102 a night and it was more than worth it. From the concierge at check-in with bottled water to the wine in the evening was great! The room was a little small, but clean with a great bed- soft blankets, pillows and comfy. The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions, restaurants recommendations, etc. In the lobby lounge there was coffee/tea every a.m., cookies on the concierge station, in the p.m. and 5-6 every evening red and white wine-complimentary for all guests. We are from NYC and for first time visitors to the San Fran we found this hotel to be in a great location for getting to most neighborhoods- especially if you like to walk. We would recommend it and hope to stay there again."
172,2140,"Mar 12 2006	Fabulous intimate hotel off of Union Square --home away from home!	This was my second time staying at the Prescott after and once again, I had an absolutely fantastic experience. We arrived from the airport early and they immidiately gave us our room and checked us in, even though it was only 10:00 AM. The room was very nice. It was small, but this was to be expected as it is a boutique hotel and it is in San Francisco. The room was decorated very well and the bedding was lovely. The bathroom was on the smaller side, but again, it's San Francisco. There was plenty of room for my beauty products on the counter and it was very clean (I am very picky about hotels!) The shower was small, only big enough for one person, but I thought it was nice and I loved the little square shaped tub. It was large enough that I (at 5'7&quot; could) easily sit cross legged and enjoy a hot bath after a day of walking around the City.The hotel offered a complimentary wine reception every evening downstairs for all guests and for Club Level guests they also offer a free breakfast as well as an evening wine reception with hors o'deruves in the Club Level lounge. It was a very nice touch. The wine could have been better, but hey, you can't complain too much when it's totally free. The location is prime, just a block away from Union Square and world class shopping and plenty of restaurants. I felt very safe walking to and from the hotel. The staff was absolutely fabulous and they did their best to make us feel welcome and it seemed that no request was too much. I had the stomach flu the second day there and the staff bent over backwards trying to make me more comfortable and even gave me complimentary ice and other things to make my stay more pleasureable. I cannot say enough positive things about them.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a lovely boutique hotel that is intimate and doesn't scrimp on it's luxuries or service. Do be aware that the rooms are small because it is a boutique hotel. As long as you're aware that the hotel is what it is, I am sure you will love it. I cannot wait to return to my &quot;second home&quot; at The Prescott."
173,2140,"Mar 9 2006 	Very happy with the Prescott - stayed multiple times	I disagree with the person who wrote the bad review below. I have stayed at the Prescott numerous times on business, and am very happy with the hotel. The rooms are cozy, very well appointed and very comfortable. The hotel itself is very nice and elegant. It is a small, boutique style hotel, located very close to Union Square.I've stayed on the club level many times, and the complimentary wine, hors d'oevures and breakfast are always nice. This time, however, I did not get the upgrade, and was wondering if I would be as happy. While I did miss the freebies, the room, amenities and service were just as good.Postrio is the restaurant in the hotel, and the food is outstanding (if a little pricey, but it is downtown SF). Only one problem - and it's a big problem - we have an 8 month old baby, we asked for a crib -- and the crib fell apart when he jumped around a little in it. It was poorly constructed. He came close to really hitting his head hard. Lesson learned for us.So - overall, a great hotel, but don't trust the crib they give you if you have a baby. Otherwise would have given an &quot;excellent&quot; rating."
174,2140,"Nov 18 2005 	Very Nice Great Area	I stayed there for 3 nights on business and was pleasantly surprised. The hotel looks great from the outside, and has charm on the inside. The staff at the front desk made me feel welcome after a long trip and the room was nicely decorated. While there wasn't much of a view, everything else was outstanding, plus it is near the cable cars on Powell Street and Union Square. I would definitely stay there again. The rooms were bigger than the Sir Francis Drake and Galleria Park."
175,2140,"Nov 16 2005	Overprices hotel for poor experience	HOTEL REVIEW OF THE PRESCOTT HOTEL  SAN FRANCISCO: I rarely take time to write a review on a hotel. Isnt it easier just to be unhappy  and tell yourself you would never return again? But I feel compelled to write this  partly because others deserve to know  and party because this is the beauty of the internet. So others will know.I stayed at The Prescott over a long weekend in mid November of 2005. I was looking for a hotel room  and found that the Westin, Hyatt and other larger hotels were sold out due to several conventions in town. I opted for the upgraded Club Level at a price I thought reasonable if it lived up to expectations (in the low $200s). I was attracted by the several of the advertising words that The Prescott uses. Small boutique hotelluxury hotel or get this one: private Union Square retreat The hotel claims, unsurpassed luxury of our Club Level. the Prescott Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, offers a world-class luxury hotel experience for discriminating travelers.I dont think so.First of all  this hotel, due to its history, is doomed to begin with. In its early days  the hotel was a small speak easy. The rooms are incredibly small  requiring you to either open the close door or the bathroom door. Not both at the same time. They do their best to distract you from the size  adding nice linens (now the trend for all) and giving you Aveda grooming products, as does the Westin. So, if the room is not so wonderful  then perhaps the service? They claim to give you Services expected from a Mobil Four-Star and AAA Four-Diamond luxury hotel. Such as what? Valet parking at the hotel is $38 per night. Although this is expected these days from most hotel rooms. They do offer preferred reservations at Postrio, a long ago inspiration from Wolfgang Puck who had now moved on. They talk about having twice daily maid service. But watch out. They will annoy you to death! The maids are told they must finish their work by 3:00. If you happen to be sleeping in late or come back to the room  and are not timed to their schedule, they will incessantly knock on your door and ask when the can service your room. Even if you hang your Do not disturb sign out! I complained to the fron desk  and he simply said, We know  but if they dont get them done  then they have to rush at the last minute and they dont want to do that! What kind of service is that?The location is indeed a few blocks from Union Square. If you take the right streets back to the hotel  you are all right. If you deviate just a bit  you find yourself on streets where you are accosted 3-4 times every block by panders who want donations. But sadly  that is the case with many streets these days in downtown San Francisco.Do you get what you pay for? When paying the amount for The Club Level  you believe you are getting an upgrade. The rooms are still the same size. And in fact, getting to the rooms become a bit of a pain in the butt. For some reason  the hotel purchased the upper floors of a building behind the original building. In order to get to this famed CLUB LEVEL room  you must first take an elevator up to the fourth floor  and the walk across an enclosed ramp to take you to the back building. Once their, I had to take another elevator to the 7th floor and down a small hallway  in which my luggage and myself and to walk single file to get to the room. But wait  it should be worth it for the famous Postrio inspired happy hour? First of all  happy hour here is from 4:30  6:30. In San Francisco? Who goes to happy hour then? Usually  most hotels have happy hour from 6-8  so that you can have a cocktail before you go out to dinner. Not here. This is a chow line for cheap people who are being sure to get their monies worth. For this weekend  the lounge was filled with older folks who were in town to attend a local university football game. For this crowd  having unlimited martinis at 4:30 in the afternoon is a plus. (And I must admit  they nice chap at the bar is charming and poured freely!) But surely the appetizers would be great? Well  get this. You think you are getting wonderful woodburning fireplace pizza from the famous Wolfgang Puck. Well  perhaps he did the dough. But that is about it. Poor Julio at The Prescott  the bartender in this small lounge just off the ramp between the two building is also a pizza cooker. He takes out frozen pizzas that are given to him, tosses on a few pieces of basil leaves or red peppers  and tosses them in a small convection oven in his little bar closet. He can do one little pizza at a time  and so the guests all wait around, knives and forks in hand  and when one gets done  he walks around sliding little pieces of the pizza, as he were feeding the seals down at Pier 39! And if this tastes like the pizzas downstairs  then I think old Wolfgang has lost it. If I were him  I would be horrified to know that his food was being marketed and served this way! What is funny is that, on the one night when I tried this (and not again!), many of the individuals were commenting to each other that this would be their meal for the night. My gawd! Wrong crowd!Breakfast in the morning is one toaster with some bagels. A few kinds of cereal. And one large pot of coffee that burns after the first hour.The hotel advertisement claims that With our exemplary service and attention to detail, you'll find that the Prescott Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, offers some of the best accommodations in San Francisco. I have stayed at many hotel in San Francisco  and I assure you  it is not true. Spend the money at any of the other real four or five star hotels. Kimpsy claims that every hotel tells a story. I am not sure this is a good story. I caution you. Unless of course  you want to be a seal!"
176,2140,"Nov 9 2005	Prescott Hotel - Great service	We have just recently returned from a stay at the Prescott Hotel in San Fran. It is a small but lovely hotel with the staff bending over backwards to provide great service. Everyone was terrific. The rooms are typical of a smaller hotel, extremely clean, very quiet. The turn-down service was such a nice added touch, chocolates on the bed and classical music softly playing when we would return to the room. The restaurant connected was a little on the expensive and snobby side. I wanted to take a drink back to the room to enjoy in a more relaxing atmosphere and was rushed to order, to pay and to leave. The Prescott is right in Union Square, near shopping and the cable cars. I would definintely stay there again."
177,2140,"Oct 7 2005	Highly recommend the Prescott	I had a wonderful stay at the Prescott. The hotel is very well maintained and beautifully decorated. I am very particular about where I stay and am one of those people that needs to make sure that everything is clean, and I felt very comfortable here. The rooms were well appointed with quality linens, bath robes, and Aveda bath products which I just love. While many say the rooms are small, I found it was just fine for two people and for me I am more concerned with the quality and cleanliness for which I had no problems. I thought the turndown service with the chocolates was a nice touch, and of course I had to eat both of them :)We stayed in the Club Level and really enjoyed the breakfast and the evening cocktails/appetizers. The food was very well presented and of good quality. Additionally, I liked the comfort of the large chairs and living room environment. It really was a nice break in between the sight seeing and dinner. A good opportunity to unwind and socialize. We even ran into some fellow Buckeyes!The rooms were quiet and we heard no noise from the streets below. The beds were comfortable and we had no problems with the water or plumbing! Thank goodness, I was worried by some of the previous comments. We really enjoyed our stay and I would recommend it highly. The location is right in the heart of it all and perfect for connecting to all that you may want to see. We had dinner at Tiramisu at the recommendation of the concierge, and had a wonderful dinner. You should go if you get the chance!"
178,2140,"Oct 6 2005	Wonderful Hotel!	This hotel was perfect for our much-needed romantic get-away to San Francisco! We got the &quot;Romance&quot; package which was just $245 per night. That included a bottle of champagne, chocolates, and special bath items.The room was clean, fresh looking, and tasteful. The bathroom even had a jetted tub, which was a nice touch.The service was wonderful; the staff was attententive and prompt. The Club Level lounge was very nice for the complimentary morning breakfast and afternoon cocktails. Overall, a first-rate hotel."
179,2140,"Sep 25 2005	A bit of Europe	Definately a First Class Hotel. I recommend this hotel if you want luxury and ambience of a small European style hotel instead of the large, busy convention style hotels."
180,2140,"Sep 5 2005	squeaky wood floors	My wife and I stayed at the Prescott August 26 &amp; 27, 2005, because we generally like the Kimpton Group hotels and wanted to try a different one (we would normally stay at Palomar).We stayed in a club level room. It was tiny and seemed to be no different from the non-club level rooms that we peeked into whle they were being cleaned.Our major complaint is that the Prescott's floors are wood. So you hear every move that the guests above you make. Our upstairs neighbor seemed unusually restless at 3 am. Also, the cleaning staff made an unacceptable amount of noise at 8 am cleaning the room next door.Also, our room looked worn and dated. Like the hotel was last refreshed in the late 1980's. It's time for new carpet, wallpaper, and paint!As a final insult, a trim piece from my wife's car was missing when it was returned by the valet parking staff at the end of our stay. We've complained, but the hotel hasn't made it right yet.We wouldn't stay here again. The Palomar is a much better value within the Kimpton group hotels in San Francisco."
181,2140,"Aug 12 2005	Great Birthday!	My husband and I stayed at the Prescott for a long weekend for my birthday. The hotel was in the perfect location, only 2 blocks from union square. The hotel is smaller than a lot of the chains but it has such a cozy feeling. We upgraded to the club level which was fabulous. The rooms were not large but they were beautiful. When you stay in the club level you get to use the club lounge which had breakfast and a bar. The continental breakfast was very nice and they had an open bar and munchies from 4:30-6:30 every evening. They served yummy pizza from the wolfgang puck restaurant next door.Everyone at the hotel was super nice and the best part is that they didn't charge us for the upgrade. I think because I told them it was my birthday.....as an aside, if you go to chinatown you must eat at &quot;the house of nam king&quot;...it is the best chinese I have ever had. (the decor leaves much to be desired but the food is great)"
182,2140,"Jul 31 2005	Perfect for the solo traveler	The Prescott was the perfect hotel for me as a solo (female) traveler in San Francisco. I received a surprisingly low rate for 5 nights w/air on Expedia - did not expect that I could afford the Prescott based on earlier rates I saw. The location on Post was 2 blocks from downtown/Union Square action, but on a more quiet street. Yes, there was construction across the street (and I had a street level room), but I didn't notice the noise. Excellent bed/pillows, very clean, safe block. Loved the small room; there would have been plenty of space for another person's stuff. Just one complaint - the toilet seemed ready to back up the entire time I was there, but thankfully never did. Shower pressure was excellent, but taller persons than me (5'9&quot;) might wish for a higher shower head. Plenty of counter space in the bathroom for my toiletries. Complimentary Aveda products were appreciated, as well as chocolate every evening! I would definitely recommend the Prescott."
183,2140,"Jul 22 2005	rooms are small/service is big	My husband and I spent 6 enjoyable nights at the Prescott. The hotel offers all the amenities of a deluxe hotel: terry robes, makeup mirror, in-room safe (large enough for laptop), twice a day maid service, etc. Rooms are small (typical for the city) but clean and well appointed with excellent beds! Entire staff friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful whether for restaurant recommendations or public transportation to attractions. The location is central, though construction across the street could make front-facing rooms noisy. Just prior to our stay, my husband was nearby at the Sir Francis Drake on business, which he described as dark, dated, also small rooms, and not as guest-friendly for almost twice the price."
184,2140,"Jul 2 2005	Just average - try somewhere else if you want something special	A friend and I stayed at the Prescott for 6 nights and were not overly impressed. We had one of the rooms with 2 double beds and it was really small - I have no idea how you would fit 4 people in there. The bathroom in particular was small. We asked about a larger room but they only have the same size room for 2 beds. Our toilet backed up during the stay and they were quick to fix it, but we continued to have problems with it. In addition, there was contruction being done on the street outside the windows that started at 7 am and made it difficult to sleep. The concierge was usually very helpful and friendly, although we had an emergency situation during one of the nights and the night staff was not knowledgable. The furnishings were very nice and the room was cleaned well each day, and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel restaurant was excellent, although one of the more expensive in the city. The hotel was downtown and close to shops and Union Square, but there are tons of other hotels in that area. Not a horrible experience, but I'll be trying somewhere else next time."
185,2140,"Jun 29 2005	Superior service at the Prescott!	My husband and I are a young couple, so we wanted to get the best value for our money when we were looking for hotels to stay at in San Francisco. However, we wanted to feel comfortable and slightly pampered at our hotel too, as well as stay at a place with a good location in downtown. The Prescott exceeded all of our expectations. It's located in Union Square right next to the 2 main cable car lines, so we were able to enjoy riding the cable cars and had quick access to all the places we wanted to visit. The Prescott is a smaller hotel so they are able to provide superior service to all of their guests. The staff was so friendly and courteous--every member of the staff greeted us with a smile and &quot;How are you doing?&quot; throughout our stay. Our room was always clean and well-maintained, and the cleaning staff always came at the perfect time. Our room was always clean by 10 or 11am, which is earlier than I have seen at other hotels. The concierge recommended a restaurant to us for each night of our stay and helped us plan a biking trip around the Golden Gate Bridge. The bell staff was very helpful and polite, in fact, one member of the staff, Mike, suggested an amazing drive past Carmel to Big Sur, which ended up being one of the higlights of our trip!! We had to wait a bit long for our car to be brought up (I think this is due to the fact that the staff is smaller than what you have at a bigger hotel). This is the only reason I rated the Prescott as above average and not excellent. It was really the only complaint we had, if you consider that a complaint. We would definitely go back to the Prescott in the future! If you want a friendly, smaller hotel that is elegantly and comfortably furnished, the Prescott is for you."
186,2140,"May 10 2005	Prescott Hotel offers great location to Union Square	We spent a Saturday night at this boutique type hotel. It is a 7 story old wood framed building with wood subfloors and with many of the old wood sash windows still in place.The subfloors have the occasional creeky sound to them in the hallways and the rooms. It has been kept up in terms of cosmetic detail, such as carpets, wallpaper, and painting. Elevators are the small type and the building still has the classic stairwell design on all floors. The rooms are small, but the finish details such as the big 12&quot; wood baseboards, the chair rail tend to give it a nice architectual feel. The bed, sheets, and toppings are very comfortable. The bathrooms are long and narrow but offer an adequate area. Hallways are warm in color and well lighted. The morning continental breakfast on the 4th floor is a very comfortable setting. With many overstuffed type chairs and some tables to pick your spot to choose from 4 cereals, fresh fruit, from apples to strawberries, watermelon, and bananas. Toaster for bagels and a few fruit juices are also available as well as a few morning newspapers. Had a triple AAA rate of $152. 00 and parking was an additional $36.00. We missed the complimenatary wine night on the !st floor but it has a nice setting with a fireplace and many seats. The staff from the doorman, valet parking and clerks all were professional and accomodating.and we were allowed late checkout at 2:30 pm. Have stayed at many properties in the Union Square area and this certainly will be one my wife and I return to visit. The Prescott Hotel has a charm and a warm feel to it as an older property and the location does not get any better for that area."
187,2140,"Feb 3 2005	Wonderful hotel; great location; great service	We just returned from four nights at the Prescott and had a wonderful stay. The location of this hotel is great and we were able to walk everywhere. The service was excellent and the rooms were very nice, although our room (one king bed) was quite small.We stayed on the Club level, which I would highly recommend. You get a great continental breakfast (juice, fruit, great pastries, bagels, cereal, coffee, tea) and an open bar cocktail hour (actually two hours) every afternoon. Snacks are provided by Postrio, one of the top restaurants in SF. Also with the Club rooms you get your choice of morning newspaper (SF Chronical, NY Times, or USA Today) and free shoe shines.All in all we had a great visit to San Francisco, made even better by staying at the Prescott. We'll be sure to stay there again next time."
188,2140,"Nov 5 2004 	Halloween in SF at the Prescott	We visited SF for 3 nights over the recent Halloween weekend. THe primary purpose of the trip was for me to attend the AES (Audio Engineering Society) annual convention at the Moscone Center. (imagine many thousands of recording engineers drooling over the latest expensive equipment exhibits). But the convention would only take up 10 or 12 hours of my time, so we decided to make the trip into a family vacaction, the two of us AND our little Rosebud, a half Chihauhau / half Dachshund mix that was liberated from the local shelter earlier this year. We decided to drive from LA to SF (why doesn't Amtrak accept pets?!?) and that brings up one of the few negatives about the Prescott. I can understand expensive valet parking if you need access to your car, but if you are going to check in and not touch your vehicle until checkout, there should be less expensive options than $35/night plus tax.The staff at the hotel appeared very happy to greet Rosebud upon our arrival. We were staying at a discounted rate due to the hotel's offer to match any rate from any online booking service. In addition to matching the rate, for booking directly with the hotel, we received a room upgrade and an offer of late checkout. The room was larger than I had be led to expect based on other reviews. For a small hotel nearly 100 years old, the room was larger and nicer than most, certainly in this price range. Someone used to staying in top luxury hotels would have felt quite comfortable here. (Note that our room was a good bit larger than the standard basic room.) We also had a view out the front of the hotel, across Post St. - nothing spectacular, but nicer than an alley or interior shaft.The hotel has minimal public space, just a single mid-sized room behind the small lobby. But this room includes a fireplace, a small bar where wine is served every afternoon at 5pm and a pair of internet access PCs. Its a comfortable space when you want to get out of your room for a while without leaving the hotel. The hotel is connected to the adjacent Postrio restaurant, another Wolfgang Puck creation, but a big step up from his mid-level cafes that you find in touristy shopping areas. Postrio is a serious restaurant with very good food. We had no plans to dine there, but one night we found ourselves looking for a decent place at 10:30pm and Postrio was the only place we could find that was still open. We are very glad we ended up there - it wasn't cheap, but it was worth what they charged. Postrio is also responsible for the room service in the hotel, which means good food, but only from 6am until midnight; we are big fans of 24hr room service, but we got by with the limited hours and good food available from Postrio.I can't really comment about the &quot;Club Level&quot; other than I don't think its necessary as long as you get an upgraded room on a non-club level floor. I can certainly recommend room 317 as very nice for a moderate sized, non-suite room. Overall, we had a great time, the staff were very nice to Rosebud and we would certainly stay there again. (especially recommended for anyone travelling with their dog! Although we only met two other couples who had their dogs with them, the hotel seems to do everything they can to make you feel welcome with your dog.)"
189,2140,"Nov 1 2004	Great Location and Comfortable.	The Prescott is one of the most comfortable hotels I have ever stayed at. The beds are wonderful and the towels are fluffy and soft. The rooms are very small; and the view out of the room is bland. BUT, it's only a couple of blocks from Union Square, it's walking distance to a number of breakfast places and if you get a chance, have lunch at the restaurant. It's superb."
190,2140,Oct 24 2004 	Good location but need investment	Stayed there mid Sept. The location is great as it is really 2 blocks from the cable car and the shopping district.The service was OK but not excellent. The rooms need some investment but it is still acceptable.Don't have a breakfast room and only offer coffee in their lobby. This is not what I expected from this level of hotel in the US.
191,2140,"Oct 18 2004	Really Good but not flawless	Let me say that overall my wife and I enjoyed our stay very much. This is an exclusive, high-end hotel that offers privacy and comfort without a lot of hustle-bustle. This is exactly what we needed. If you are looking for new and contemporary, this is not the place. We arrived last week in the midst of the Hotel Union strike so we were pleasantly surprised that none of the Prescott Employees were striking. As we walked around the city, employees at other hotels were really causing a stir. Presott employees seemed happy and content to be there.Overall the staff was pleasant and the accommodations welcoming. I especially thought the maids and technical support staffs were bending over backwards to please us (very timely and prompt). I enjoyed the complimentary Aveda products in the room and the candy in the honor bar was fresh. Room service was prompt. The linen was high end and very nice. This Hotel was not like traditional chain ones, it was much better, more on the scale of a bed and breakfast. Quaint and antiquey (if that's a word). We were provided with a free upgrade that had no view. Both windows were blocked by the walls of the parking deck. Didn't bother us other than I could not get cell phone reception. The water pressure was hot and strong (great assets). The room also had a Jacuzzi tub (great if you are into that). The gym was small but well stocked with all the equipment I like. High end Elyptical and bicycles and a universal machine. This was great. The Hotel was more of a boutique place and we both loved it. The complimentary wine each evening was a plus. Red and chilled white in a self serve setting. Some cheese and crackers would have made it better but the wine was good and plentiful. We often took advantage before dinner. Proximity to the shopping district downtown was awesome. We walked everywhere and the shuttle we took to the wharf was free because the trolley was out. What was not good:We were never able to get internet access in our room. And access from the lobby was expensive and not geared towards long time use. The technician tried to hook us up in our room but after installing 2 different types of modem equipment, they not only were not able to deliver, but the follow up was poor. We were told we would be contacted with an explanation or a solution but were not. When we inquired again, the front desk offered to allow us to use theirs, but it was not convenient. We had expected to conduct several hours of business from our room. Therefore, if you are planning a business stay, you may want to acquire the necessary assurances so this won't happen to you.Concierege and front desk staff curb staff etc.:Good service but splotchy. I suggest they may need some cultural sensitivity training to learn how to be more accomodating to minorities. There was a consistent hint of &quot;Are you sure you are in the right place?&quot; When dealing with agents other than those who knew us from initially checking in. When our cab first arrived, the bellman did not greet us and we handled our own bags. When he later saw us checking in at the front desk, he seemed surprised. Upon check out, instead of hailing a cab for us, he strongly insisted we take a private car. This was OK I guess, but the way he handled it was a little curt, as if I did not have common sense. In a nutshell, I would stay there again."
192,2140,Sep 8 2004	Great Hosts	A busy place but not too busy to answer your questions and try to meet your needs. The staff is great and the wine social hour is lots of fun meeting new people from all-over the world. A little spendy but you deserve it .
193,2140,"Aug 16 2004	Good stay!	I really would give this 4.5 of 5 stars if I could. We had a club level room which I would recommend. The staff was helpful and courteous at all times. The happy hour was great. We had a problem getting our wireless internet to work but we called down and they brought us a bridge which worked like a charm. I only have a few nitpicky issues... first of all, there is not enough seating in the club lounge. People were balancing their plates on their knees during the breakfast and a lot of people were having a hard time trying to find a place to sit. The lounge atmosphere is great with the large chairs, etc., but it's really not practical for breakfast. Also, the food at the breakfast was not that impressive--just a lot of carb-loading! Bagels, bread, cereal, and pastry. Finally, I agree with one reviewer who said the sheets were a little scratchier than what you might expect at a supposedly fairly luxurious hotel. As you can see, these are minor issues and they would not prevent me from staying there again. Overall I thought it was great!"
194,2140,Aug 10 2004	Prescott was great!	We spent 4 nights at the Prescott was were very impressed. Heavenly bed similar to the Westin and high end extras. Free coffee in the morning and a happy hour in the afternoon. The location was great. Staff were very helpful and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel.
195,2140,"Aug 10 2004	Enjoyable but Tiny Boutique	My wife and I stayed here for a night last month, and had a decent experience. We got a relatively good deal on Hotwire for this hotel (@$135 all inclusive), which was listed as a Favorite. It's a small boutique hotel with some charm and a truly wonderful restaurant, though we had a few issues. The room was nice enough, but quite small, reminiscent of European hotels (though actually almost all of our rooms in France were bigger). In fact, our bed was supposed to be king-sized, but looked suspiciously like a double. It was probably for the best, since I'm not sure a king would have fit in that room. The bathroom was clean, but with an almost comical lack of shelf space. We were having to balance our toiletries on the sink and the bath basin with little success. And despite a request for a higher level room (it's a small building), we endured an amazing amount of noise from below. I don't think we were located above the Postrio bar if my orientation was correct, so I'm not sure of the noise's source. But it was as though we were next door to a very lively party until after 11 PM. The sheets were a little scratchy for a nice hotel, though the furnishings were generally nice, but we felt somewhat cramped. We dined at Postrio that evening, and the food was heavenly. The prices were stratospheric as well, but I guess you have to indulge sometimes, and the tasting menu was a definite hit with both my wife and myself. The concierge was generally helpful, with a nice young lady named Amy procuring us tickets to an apparently very popular show, Beach Blanket Babylon (side note: avoid this, unless your love for follies-type shows can overcome being VERY crowded and without A/C for a couple of hours). Altogether, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, and even insisted on serving us some wine a few minutes after the complimentary daily wine tasting had ended. It's a decent hotel, with a very good staff and wonderful restaurant, but the cramped rooms and excessive noise may mar an otherwise recommended experience. On the other hand, friends of ours stayed there a couple of nights after we checked out, and loved the place, though they admitted the rooms were a bit small. But they had no problems with noise, so in all fairness, that may well have been an unfortunate coincidence. I'd probably rank it a 3.5 of 5 if I had the ability."
196,2140,May 24 2004	Prescott - A lifesaver	THe Prescott came to my aid after I left another hotel around the block which could n't provide high speed access. They set me up with a wireless bridge which worked perfectly with my laptop. I had no problem with cell phone reception in my room and probaly made 50 calls at the time. THe only reason I didn't give this lovely hotel excellent is due to the limited room service. It is difficult to find a place in the neighbourhood to get a reasonably priced meal - you don't want $30.00 entrees every night.
197,2140,"May 21 2004	Hotel great for the leisure traveller don't try it for business	I travel to San Francisco fairly frequently and have tried a number of hotels during my visits. I decided to try something different during my most recent trip that was at the end of April, 2004.The hotel is very conveniently located right by Union Square and not too expensive -- a regular room rate at this time was about $180. I decided to stay in what the Prescott considered a suite with a separate living room so I could conduct some meetings in the suite rather than book a separate meeting room which tends to be more formal anyway. I arrived at the hotel and found out that my &quot;suite&quot; was not anywhere close to any suite I have ever seen. The &quot;living area&quot; of the suite couldn't have been much for than 100 square feet and in no way could accommodate the meetings I was going to be doing. This, to be fair, is not entirely the hotel's fault as I didn't check them thoroughly enough, but the descriptions on their website were a little misleading.The room themselves were fine. Nothing remarkable or fancy. My biggest complaint about my room, and most of the hotel (except for the very front of the lobby) is that I could not get a wireless reception for my cell phone anywhere. This may not be important when travelling on vacation, but can be a big issue when your lifeline to people who are trying to get in contact with you is cut off because the hotel hasn't installed the necessary repeaters on their roof to allow wireless connectivity.The room service was limited as the hotel did not have its own kitchen per se, but you were able to order room service from the restaurant Postrio next door. The food is quite good, but very limited even by room service standards. This was not a huge deal as there are many places within a two block radius to get many different types of cuisine.The concierge staff was very good, and most all of the employees were extremely well trained. Being a boutique hotel with a small number of rooms is a plus as you don't feel as if you (or the staff) are being overwhelmed with a lot of people. The fact that the hotel is a boutique is its greatest strength and greatest weakness. It has the nice feel and service of a boutique without the amenities of a bigger, more business oriented hotel.I would definitely stay at the hotel again, but not for business. Having to stand outside at 3:30 a.m. to try to get e-mail and mobile phone reception to handle something that was happening back on the East Coast was enough to dissuade me from staying there again for work. However, if I was travelling to San Fran for a nice weekend, I would definitely consider it."
198,2140,"Apr 27 2004	The Service at the Prescott in Impecable	The Prescott is &quot;home away from home&quot;. Impecable service, friendly and extremelly professional. I have been a repeat guest for many years and trhough management and staff changes I have always found that there is a continuous improvement.I could not believe the previous review for my experience is nothing but the exact opposite. I am a guest with some frequency and always meet other guests that share the same feeling; of being welcomed back with sincerity and most importantly that the staff cares.Great value, excellent service and I highly recommend"
199,2140,"Feb 19 2004	Kimpton Group Member got disregarded club level not worth the price difference	Stayed at the Prescott for 2 nights on Feb 13 &amp; 14. Had a club level king suite. Club Level - not worth the price difference. You get a continental breakfast (most hotels include this anyhow) and afternoon reception with postrio pizza. One small pizza is available every 20 minutes or so for 35 to 40 people. Otherwise they do have cheese, grapes, and crackers (big deal). I guess if you are an alcoholic than the reception would be worth the $70 to $80 price difference. Also, they totally disregarded my Kimpton Hotel Group membership which Prescott is a part of and they refused to give me the 10% discount I should have gotten as a member. On my member profile I requested a room away from the elevator and they booked me right next to the elevator! Luckily the room was pretty quiet, which is what I wanted. The bed was really comfortable which was nice but to my disgust they don't use comforter covers only flat sheets to cover the comforter and I found I was sleeping next to what looked liked blood stains, just disgusting. Needless to say the maid changed the comforter the next day. The rooms are nice overall, although some of the furniture and fixtures are worn. Oh by the way, NO VIEW anywhere in the hotel, just looks out into the alley and other hotel guests, I had to keep the drapes drawn the whole time. The location was great, can't beat it. You don't need a car there, as cable cars and buses are nearby, buy a muni pass which will cover the trolleys, cable cars and buses. Overall the hotel was okay, not worth the price, San Francisco I enjoyed as always."

They changed our room because they thought the people next door might get noisy and put us in a better room.Close to everything. and FREE Parking.Can be a bit of street noise but it's on a main street so no big deal.Will stay again. highly recommended.

2,2141,"Jul 28 2009 	Middle of the road...	After booking a hotel with Hotwire (its always a mystery which hotel you are getting until after you pay) and when i found out it was The Presidio and looked on this site I was SCARED. I warned my family to be prepared for a real dump. LOCATION: wonderful. Near everything, even Golden Gate Bridge. A Wal-greens and I-Hop are nearby. The view was nice too (we were 2nd floor).OUTSIDE: Kept clean and neat. Parking was convienant but if you are driving a big car like an Excursion then good luck with that. OFFICE: people were friendly bt the thick accent was terriblly annoying when trying to communicate. I had to ask questions in person to try and lip read (no lie).INSIDE:not as bad as I was expecting but not as clean as you would find at a known chain hotel. Appeared like they have been attempting to do updates but they should invest in better housekeepers instead.BATHROOM: appeared very yclean but towels are small and thin and not that great of water pressure. NO counter made for a pain in the *ss when trying to primp in the mornings. CLOSET: small mirrored closet outside bathroom which was nice but...there is no light in, over, or around the closet area so the bathroom door muct be open in order to see whats in the closet. Annoying.BEDS: basically, terrible. If you have back issues then please beware. DECOR: kinda 80's...burgandy motif. Pleated curtains not hung right and closed in the door eachtime we closed the door. NOISE: one night was very noisy, walls are thin. Second night was very quiet. I sleep through anything so it didnt bother me but it kept others with me awake. And I will say that one staff member chewed out a few teen girls who were carrying on late at night outside of the hotel. So they do not look the other way.THUMBS DOWN:mattresses, employee accents, needs a deep cleaning.THUMBS UP: location, parking, elevator, view**I am confused b/c we got TWO card style keys to use although others are saying they had to use old fashioned keys??"
3,2141,"Jul 10 2009 	Excellent Stay	I stayed here 4th of July weekend, and I had a wonderful experience. First of all, the price was about $75, which is great for San Francisco I believe. I asked for an upgraded room, just because it never hurts to ask, and I got it. We stayed in room 301, which only has one key, no card key. So, to get maid service, I had to drop the key off at the front reception desk, which was no issue at all. The room had a nice veiw, which was important to me. The staff was very nice and helpful. The free in and out parking was very convienent, and saved us a lot of money."
4,2141,"Jun 2 2009 	New nice and very friendly management	The search for a decent motel in San Francisco wasn't easy since a lot of them are booked full in advance or don't wan't to rent to students, black people, etc. We eventually went to the Presidio Inn, where we found a clean room with all the necessary and less necessary stuff you can ask for, and this for a very decent price. We were first a little suspicious, since there wasn't a lot of people, the owner let us now though that he recently took over the bussiness and he still had some bad reviews from the last owner. The manager was a very friendly and helpfull guy. We even spend two hours on his phone trying to fix some problems with a shipping firm, he never made a problem out of it. So,if you want a room to sleep well and be able to take a nice shower or bath, in a clean room, this is the place to be. Especially when you're on a budget..."
5,2141,"Feb 26 2009 	Stay Away From This Filthy Place	dishonest Management, dirty rooms, unfriendly staff - thats all I can say about this terrible place. I cannot understand, how some people find the rooms clean. You put your health in jeopardy if you stay there. When we complained about the discrepancy between the internet photos and the reality , the staff told us that everybody is lying on the internet and we have to pay for the room even if we don't stay."
6,2141,"Feb 3 2009 	Security Non-Existent For Stay In 2004	I stayed at the Presidio Inn Hotel August 10 - 11 in 2004. During the morning of August 11, I locked my room and went to the front office to borrow a telephone directory. I was at the front office for 15 minutes. While I was at the front office, I heard the woman at the counter say to someone on the office telephone, &quot;she is here looking at travel brochures.&quot; I asked the woman who she was talking to. She said she was talking to her husband. I thought it was a strange thing for her to say to her husband. I walked back to my room and picked up my purse and went to the Denny's Restaurant next door to have lunch. When I went to the cashier to pay for my meal, I noticed my wallet was missing from my purse. I thought I left it in my room as I used a telephone card from my wallet earlier that morning. I searched my room top to bottom, but I did not find my wallet. I told the manager about my missing wallet , and he searched my room; but, he did not find my wallet. The only people who entered my room earlier that day were the cleaning women. Within one hour of my discovering my wallet was missing and reporting it to the police illegal charges were made to my charge cards. The thief got my drivers license, my original Social Security card, charge cards, membership cards, cash, and other personal documents. The thief charged about $10,000 on my credit cards and got away with that amount without being apprehended. The thief charged dinner for several people at the International House of Pancakes a block from the Presidio Inn Hotel and purchased many gift cards at Macy's in San Francisco. The manager of the Presidio Inn did not want to question the cleaning help and did not believe they had any involvement. I have never had an experience like that at any other hotel I have stayed at. I was told it is easier to track who enters one's room if an electronic room card key is issued at a hotel. The Presidio Inn Hotel uses the old type room keys instead of the electronic room card keys; therefore, there is no way to track who enters one's room."
7,2141,Nov 10 2008 	Heck on Earth	The staff was extremely unprofessional. The price I reserved the room for was supposedly inaccurate. They advertised FREE continental breakfast and IN room coffee. Then the tried to charge us $5.00 per person for a pkg. danish and coffee. Their wifi connectiopn was extremely poor! I would absolutely advise against this place!!
8,2141,"Aug 29 2008 	Do not Stay Here!!!	This hotel is not what it says it is. Indeed about 8 years ago when I stayed there, it looked like the photos on the website, but NOT any more. Haven stayed there before, and checking the pics on the website, I felt safe to stay there again recently. I was so wrong! Here are some pictures to prove it, BE AWARE, long story short, we finally got our money back after a dispute involving the BBB. Good luck"
9,2141,"Jul 29 2008 	Don't book this hotel from the web site pictures...	because the manager lied. The photos on the web site are NOT the same hotel room that I booked. I initially booked a 4 nights stay and left after only 1 night. I saw the photos on the web site and then called the manager to see if the hotel had actually been upgraded. He said yes and then made a reservation. After changing rooms twice I settled for the 3rd room. It was totally disgusting...dirty, smelly and just filthy. There is no air conditioning, so the manager gave us a fan to use. You could not open the windows because there is no security, its loud and the chain on the door could not be fastened. What irritated me the most is that the photos on the website are staged and absolutely no rooms look like that. I went to IHOP the next day and found that you could book this flea bag hotel for $74. with a coupon from a hotel coupon book. Best advice...stay away."
10,2141,"Apr 22 2008	Excellent service	Finishing our 16 days trip through California, we looked for a not too expensive hotel in San Francisco. Free parking and breakfast was a must, which makes it not that easy within the City. We came across the Presidio Inn in an advert and booked a room for three nights at a price that was very good. The Room was very nice and clean and the location within the City is good. You can walk to the Wharf and other places, but the bus stop for the Wharf is just at the next blok. We were told that the management had changed recently and compared with other comments I've read after returning to Denmark I must say that the new management do what they can to &quot;upgrade&quot; the previous negative comments - so give them a chance.The only thing we would mention, which unfortunately can't be upgraded, is to realize that a hotel placed in the centre will have some traffic noise.During our stay we got a message from back home that my wifes mother had passed away. We would like to express our thanks to the mangement for his excellent service by helping us with computer access, so that we could get in touch with the family. Why mention this - is that really so important? To us this service was, as we had spent nearly a day in the City looking for an internetcaf, which seem to be very rare in San Francisco, and even the AAA refused to help us in this difficult situation!"
11,2141,"Mar 28 2008 	Verified Great!	A girlfriend and I wanted a getaway for a weekend, but on a budget. After 4 days of constant internet searches, we came across the Presidio Inn, and the &quot;Update&quot; review that precedes this one. On a chance, we took it for truth, made a reservation for one of our two nights, and set off for San Fran, fingers crossed.  Thank goodness we did! It was great! We made mention to Vee, the manager, that we'd seen a positive review and took a chance and he made sure that our stay not only warranted another good review, but truly went out of his way to ensure a fantastic weekend for us. We ended up with a two-bed room, rather than a one, which was above all the most important thing when it comes to traveling on a budget: CLEAN. We're both picky in that department, but even with inspection, bathroom, kitchenette, and beds all passed.  It was really Vee who made the difference. He answered all our questions, from sightseeing to restaurants, and made such an impression that we booked there again our second night, driving back from Sonoma and Napa to stay where we knew it was good. We paid less than any other hotel we'd seen- and have I mentioned the location was phenomenal? And free parking!! (unheard of, as far as we could tell) so we left our car and enjoyed the wharf without the hassle of finding/paying for parking. It's literally down the road from Ghiradelhi Square and the entire Marina, which makes for a fantastic walk. We even stopped in at a corner bar on the way back, paying remarkably reasonable prices for a few drinks (it was more a local pub than a tourist place) but hey, I'd rather drop a 5 than a 20 any day.  To be honest, the only (not negative, but) thing to be aware of while staying at Presidio Inn is the noise factor: it's located in a large city, and the walls are not soundproof to say the least. Coming from LA, city traffic is like a bubbling brook to us, but if you need absolute, impenetrable silence, bring earplugs. The walls are a bit thin, but unless you get stuck with disrespectful neighbors (if you do, call down to Vee; he took care of it for us :) you'll be fine.  In the end, I must recommend you disregard the negative surveys &amp; reviews: they were from a different time, different manager. Presidio Inn was a great stay for an amazing price, &amp; I will definately be back!"
12,2141,"Mar 16 2008 	Update	We booked this hotel based on a travel website but almost cancelled when we started reading old reviews. We're glad we decided to check it out first. I'll be honest though, the room we were in looked nothing like the rooms on the hotel website. BUT, they were comfortable and CLEAN. The management has recently changed at the inn and the new guys are doing there best to make improvements. We had better service at this place than we have had at the larger, high-scale places in town. The building is old and needs some work, but they are actively making improvements and will continue to do so until it has all been upgraded. I highly suggest giving this place a shot. It's a good bet for your money and the management will do whatever is necessary to make your stay enjoyable. They definitely have our business."
13,2141,"Sep 30 2007 	Dirty Dirt Dirty	Too bad, we didn't read this forum before we booked the room. Everything that is written in this forum about Presidio Inn is true. We entered the room and were repelled. We choose to pay twice for a room that night... I had a looong discussion with the manager about the discrepancy between the advertisement on his website and the actual condition of the hotel. He didn't even see my point and claimed that every hotel manager is lying on the webpage. Unfortunately, motels like this make people consider only the big chains for future reservations."
14,2141,"Apr 25 2007 	Never pay before you see the room	Otherwise you will have to pay for 2 hotels the same night, as we did. It's dangerous for your health and life to stay in this creepy house. Just one example. Not only they didn't wash the bed sheets, they didn't obviously change them since 80's, as they are made of holes. We had to go to neighbouring Surf Motel the same night, which was the real place to stay. AVOID PRESIDIO INN!!!!"
15,2141,"Apr 11 2007 	Keep away!!!	During our one month stay in the states we tried a lot of different hotels/motels and this one was by far the worst. The room smelled of old tobacco smoke and perfume; the toilet, shower cabinet and sink was leaky; the bedsheets were ridled with burn marks and the doors to the room and bathroom looked like they had been kicked in once or twice.The entire room gave a dirty appearance and I have never been happier to have my sleeping bag liner with me.To top it all, the elevator that the receptionist urged us to use to get to the third floor was last checked in 2004 and it's license expired in May 2005.I guess the homemade sign saying &quot;No refunds&quot; in the lobby should have made us ask to see t he room before we payed..."
16,2141,"Mar 25 2007 	Pass this one by.	I was riding a motorcycle up the coast of Californian and got to San Francisco about 9:00PM.. I did not know the area, as this was my first time in that city. I decided to stop at this hotel with no reservation and payed by CC. The room cost $84 and the manager seemed to pull this figure out of thin air. My room was supposed to be non-smoking but smelled very strongly of tobacco. Also, it was very musty and stale. During the night I heard a couple in the next room fight most of the night. In fact, many of the guests I saw appeared to be early 20's folks merely looking for a base to party from. There is a Denny's within walking distance and a Thai restaurant. However, the Thai place closes early and I had to eat at Denny's.My room had old furniture, old linen, and an unplugged alarm clock put in the back of the closet shelf. The air-conditioner kept the room cool but had the oddest noise that helped me remain awake. I just wish it could have drowned out the noise from the other, too young guests.The next morning it was obvious somebody had gone over my motorcycle looking for items to steal even though I had covered it with a m/c cover. My bike was parked RIGHT NEXT to the office.Please, do not consider this place unless you are indeed desperate for accommodations. This is a shady operation."
17,2141,"May 15 2006 	Stay away!	Dirty rooms (used condoms, stains on pillows, torn sheets, etc). Dishonest manager. Each time, I reconfirmed, he tried to quote me a higher price than guaranteed when I made the reservation &amp; secured wsith my credit card. When I checked in, he tried to get me to pay cash for my entire 2 week stay in return for a lower rate. The toliet in my room broke. He refused to fix it, because he was busy and didnt so stuff like that!!! There is no toliet in the lobby. He let me into the cleaning closet and I fixed it myself. Lovely! The restaurants nearby told me he enjoys his drinks -during work hours.It used to be a great place under old management. The new manager came in mid 2005 and I would not recommend staying there - ever! (notice reviews went from excellent to terrible after his arrival in mid '05)"
18,2141,"May 5 2006	Cancel cancel canel...don't stay here	Please avoid this hotel like the black plague. We actually did not stay here; we had friends go a day ahead of us and called us as soon as they woke up telling us to cancel. Their room did not have any granite, (falsely advertised), there were stains on the walls and overall, very disgusted by the room. We got cleaner rooms with actual nice employees at the Coventry down the road. Plus, the Coventry was cheaper!! The walls at the Presidio are paper thing. If you know that going on, great, but when they are described as &quot;quiet&quot;, this is also a lie. The management is anything but friendly. We cancelled 36 hours (they require 48) due to the fact this hotel does not match the online photos or descriptions so I am fighting like mad to get a refund, involving the BBB now. Do not give them your credit card. If this was a last resort, pay in cash if you can. The rates are totally negotiable, I have heard people getting rooms for as little at $65 and as much as $120. I am trying to find this hotel on Expedia, but in the past 2 weeks, it has appeared to of vanished into thin virtual air."
19,2141,"Mar 23 2006	Don't stay here if you can help it.	The photos shown above via the Expedia link are completely misleading -- especially the photo of the &quot;new pristine bathrooms with granite vanity.&quot; Our bathroom had a tiny white sink, stains on the walls, a non-working light, and a few small holes in the wall, one of which was plugged in with toilet paper. And I don't know on what planet this place would be considered a two-star hotel &amp; worth even a quarter of the $120 we paid for one night. (Unfortunately we had no choice but to do so, thanks to Travelocity, which completely messed up our hotel reservations. Because of Travelocity's mistake we ended up arriving in SF at 6p on a Friday night with no place to stay -- but that's another story. Come to think of it, beware of Travelocity. We've booked two trips through them, and they made major mistakes with both &amp; did nothing about it even after we complained.)Back to the Presidio Inn -- as the other reviews here state, this place is no palace -- there were unidentifiable stains on the walls, as well as peeling paint, a musty smell, stains on the coverlet &amp; blankets, towels as thin as gauze, etc. The room is also terribly noisy, not only because of the traffic on Lombard Street but also because the walls are so thin -- we could hear the person next door snoring and also the people upstairs partying all night. And in themselves all these things are not so terrible I guess if you know what to expect (not much) &amp; you just want to save money, although $120, even in SF, is way too much for something this sub-standard. Just be aware of exactly what you are getting into -- in fact, don't give them your credit card number until you've actually seen the room. That's what we should've done!!"
20,2141,"Jan 9 2006	Disgusting!!!!!!!	The photos on Trip Advisor are of another motel! Very misleading! We had a group of friends with 5 rooms and each room was disgusting. Dirty, moldy, smelly!! Some rooms had working phones, tvs, lights, other rooms didn't. Very inconsistant. Bedding was dirty, one towel in one room, none in the others. The Managers, who live there with children, were VERY rude!! They called everyone 30 minutes prior to check out to tell us to leave. They charged us $10 more than what we booked on their website - and then argued with us when we brought it to their attention. DO NOT STAY HERE!! Very dishonest people!!!"
21,2141,"Nov 11 2005	Repulsive Disgusting we were gagging!!	Picture on web was obliviously from another place. Out room was dingy, dirty, with black mild all over the ceiling and all surfaces of the bathroom (one-bulb) ...torn carpet and bedding, towels were tattered and painfully scratchy, fixtures were missing bulbs in the room, stinking unidentified tobacco and disinfectant old body odor filled the room.Arguing outside room door all night long. We bailed out two days early and moved down the street to the TraveLodge, room was same price and very new, clean and with much more room...plus working wireless internet!We were literally nauseous from the creepiness of this room. Management looked surprised when we described awful items...they, like us, must not have read all the reviews that say essentially the same thing. Next time, I'll read here before booking anywhere!GG"

23,2141,"Sep 20 2005	don't spend your money at the Presidio Inn	did the booking week in advance and called afterwards to check if everything went fine with the booking wich was confirmed by the hotel, on the arrival they told us it was overbooked and send us to an even worser hotel , afterwards I was charged one night stay on my credit card, and after several calls to straighten it out with hotel management , I got an answer that it would take 7 days to transfer it back on my creditcard, this is so called hotel policy, after seven days waiting no money so I had to work with mastercard customer service to block the amount that was charged by the hotel. Never heard from the hotel even after writing them emails about the fact. Very dishonnest management."
24,2141,"Sep 16 2005	What a Dump!!	This hotel is nothing like the hotel shown on the Presidio Inn website. The website depicts a nice looking room. This hotel was totally the opposite. Don't be fooled as we were. We'd reserved a two room &quot;suite&quot; for $154. When we arrived, we were directed to the so-called suite which was nothing more than 2 rooms next to each other with each having their own door leading to the external &quot;catwalk&quot;. Gaps in doors. There was an adjoining door which was blocked by a chair and floor lamp. This is not a suite as was decribed over the phone by the reservation person. The rooms had a very unpleasant odor and were filthy, stains on the bedspreads and carpet and even found bloodstains on the walls. Make sure you see the room for yourself before giving these people your credit card. When we went to the front desk to advise the hotel clerk that we would not be staying, his first response was that he was going to charge us anyway. I told him that the rooms were nothing like the rooms shown on their website. He became belligerent and repeated how he was still going to charge. I was connected to the supposed manager to explain my dilema only to be told again that I was still going to be charged. Travelers beware of the big scam!!"
25,2141,May 11 2005	Dishonest Management	Rude and dishonest management.Too noisy (right on the busy Lombard) - not a good sleep.Too dirty.
26,2141,"Apr 15 2005	very unfortunate experience	Well, I didn't actually get to stay at the hotel. I came there with 2 of my girlfriends for a 3-day weekend, and we ended up staying there for about an hour and left for a hotel in the downtown, same price, better service and much better location (hotel &quot;Abigail&quot;). It all started with noticing the gap in the doorway, even when the door was closed. The only way to keep it tightly shut would be to hold it in place with some heavy furniture (that's convenient!). Then we realized we had no towels and 3 wet (!) washcloths. The room was freezing, which led us to discover the third &quot;surprize&quot;: the heater lacked its cover, so the coils were exposed and just stuck out of the wall. The management refused to move us to another room saying there were none available (they then rented out one room to another man who asked for it while we were still in the office). So, when we were fed up with the &quot;surprizes&quot;, we made calls to other hotels and reserved a room in the above mentioned hotel. The management/office person was unbelievably rude and obnoxious, and believe me, I've seen some obnoxious people being a Social Worker. You just don't expect to see that in the customer service. He refused to hear about our complaints and basicaly yelled at us. Awful experience for us, but if you absolutely must stay there, check it out for yourself, may be you'll have it good... We were a lot happier staying downtown, paying the same price, having better service and just being treated like humans."
27,2141,"Mar 29 2005	Great Hotel	This hotel was really great and I recommend it highly. It is in a good neighborhood, is very affordable compared to San Francisco hotel rate standards, and the free parking and easy access to public transportation was fantastic. (Parking IS terrible to find and painfully expensive in San Francisco.) I stayed in two different rooms and both were exceptionally clean, well decorated with contemporary linens and art (my young nieces thought it was &quot;groovy&quot;), and well stocked with bath accessories (soap, shampoo, lotions). Both rooms were well lighted, especially over the sink in the bathroom (contrary to one reviewer's comments), and each room had a small kitchenette with sink, mini-fridge, and microwave. Also contrary to other reviewers, this hotel was not noisy. I stayed on both the second and third floors and found this hotel - compared to the dozens of others I have stayed in over the years -- to be very quiet. There was some traffic noise during rush hour in the morning, but even that was not disturbing: my nieces were never awakened by it. (I was generally already up before the rush hour.)Presidio Inn is one block from the Chestnut Street shopping district and two blocks from the Union Street shopping district. Many great restaurants and a couple of movie theaters nearby, too. (The Market Cafe is great for breakfast and right in the parking lot of the hotel!) Walgreen's is two blocks down the street and a small market was right around the corner on Chestnut. We were able to buy some groceries and eat some meals and snacks in the room.I was traveling with children and we were able to walk to the Exploratorium museum (about 4-5 blocks), which was nice. There is a bus stop on Chestnut Street and the No. 30 bus takes you right to Fisherman's Wharf. The only possible negative factor for this hotel might be if you travel in the summer as I did not see any evidence of air conditioning in the rooms. We visited in late spring and so this was not an issue for us, but could be on a warm day in SF.The desk host (Marty) was really accommodating and helpful. He bent over backwards to assist us in any way possible."
28,2141,"Mar 26 2005 	Tips and expectations....	The inn was clean and comfortable. Stayed 3 nights and the price was $ 65 per night (Wed, Thurs. and Fri). The inn has four stories and is reminiscent of older motor lodges with outside stairwalks and stairs. There is a small elevator. Stayed in room #27 on the third floor, there are no rooms on the first floor, just parking and a soda machine. If you stay and want a quiet room with two beds, request #35. It is on the top (4th floor) furthest from the street. The parking was free and there is ample space. The inn owns a small restaurant that was just opening the day we left. On a final note, being an older motel, if you are a lite sleeper bring earplugs as you can hear most activity if someone is above you. All in all, this is a reasonable place at very low price. I personally probably wouldn't stay again as I prefer the Argonaut hotel and this trip was with my father and he is somewhat frugal."
29,2141,"Feb 4 2005	Presidio Inn - some tips if you plan to stay there	Considering the price (we paid $69/night which included weekend nights), the Presidio Inn is a good choice if you want a basic hotel room in a central SF location at a below-market price. The BIG advantage was free parking which can run $15/night + up in the City otherwise. And, of course, parking's just a pain in SF period.IFFF you decide to go, though, DO insist on being on the top floor. This place is an older style motel with outside cat walk type &quot;halls&quot; and the insulation is such that we were twice awakened by people walking in the room above us. So top floor's a must.A bit tatty appearance-wise (torn bit of fabric for drapery tie-back, well-dinged furniture), but clean, and the bed was very comfy. The basics are there but no light over the mirror in the bathroom so doing makeup was a bit tricky. Our room did have a hairdryer which saved packing that big ole' bulky thing.Some Excellent restaurants within walking distance. Siam Thai just on the other side of the street and do SKIP IHOP which is just about next door and, instead, walk a block or two further down Lombard to Mel's Diner -- a visual classic + FAR better food than this particular location of IHOP."
30,2141,"Dec 1 2003	Nice little property with Free Parking!	We stayed 2 nights at the Presidio Inn and we are very pleased with the property. I searched for specific amenities: 2 queen beds, free parking, reasonably close to everything and &lt;$100 per night over the Thanksgiving weekend. I got everything I wanted for my family's stay. Room was nice and roomy. It even had a small kitchenette area with mini refrigerator and microwave. Very clean, and nice room with youthful/modern decor. Very quiet location yet close to everything we wanted to see. TV had lots of cable channels. We had a perfect visit."

2,2142,"Nov 18 2009 	only for location	This as everyone says is a great location. Inside it is old and kind of yucky with small elevators and typical crap bathrooms. The best part other than the proximity to the Wharf is the fire pit outside. It's gas and it lets you hang out even when the weather is brisk. As far as a drink goes, there is a 7/11 kind of store right around the corner on the way to the water...works for us! The pool is outside but heated and has nice landscaping. We were with a reunion so did not have to deal w/the parking price but it was pretty high."
3,2142,"Nov 16 2009 	Great Location	The Hotel has a great location and we were able to do everything that we wanted to in our long weekend. Staff was great! Room was on the small side, but good beds and a window that opened made up for that. We did have to move after the first night because of alot of noise from the Street. Trunks unloading from 2am until 6am so if you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for an inside room. Also no Restaurant or Bar. Great Fire Pit but without a drink it was not as fun. Safeway is 2 blocks away and we found that a cheap way to have a glass of wine."
4,2142,"Nov 12 2009 	Radisson Fisherman's Wharf	Was nice Hotel, normal wear and tear but overall, price was reasonable and location was unbeatable!"
5,2142,"Oct 30 2009 	location location location	This hotel is wonderful to stay if you want to wake up and see the city. It is steps from fisherman's wharf San Francisco where there is nightlife, shopping, great food, entertainment, and scenery. It is very centrally located. I have stayed at this hotel many times. I am from San Francisco and I always stay here. It has parking, fitness center, continental breakfast, and great service. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone due to it 's economical prices. Whenever I am in town for business or pleasure I stay here."
6,2142,Oct 28 2009 	This is one of the most miserable stays I have had at a hotel	The staff was great but the condition of the building itself made our stay miserable. The air-conditioning would only work a few hours a day at most. You could not stay in the room past about 9AM because of the heat. We tried to get the window open but the windows were so old it ended up being a two person job and when we did get it open we had to deal with all the street noise. The sleep number bed was terrible because it wouldn't work. All in all a very miserable stay. They need to do some major work on this hotel
7,2142,"Oct 22 2009 	Great location!	We recently stayed here for four nights. The room was nice but had a slightly stale odor to it. I usually travel with a small size Febreeze in my suitcase so after a few spurts - the room was OK. Sleeper Number Bed was good, we had a slight problem setting the our number. We had to call engineering to adjust the bed. They came up within 15 min. and had to reset it. After that, everything was alright. Staff was very nice esp. the housekeepers who greeted us everytime we were in the hallways.Bathroom was good sized. Nice toiletries. There was an issue with our toilet. One night it would not flush after someone had just used it before within 5 minutes. You had to wait a least 20 minutes or so. However, the next evening there was no problem (something was wrong with the water system that night?) so I didn't need to contact the Front desk.There were problems with the internet connection - esp. with logging in- sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.The best part is the location of the hotel. You are so close to all the Wharf sites.: Boudin bakery (great for breakfast, if you like just a roll and coffee) , Pier 39, the Ferry Bldg, Ghirardhelli Square, and many restaurants. If you can manage the hills, you can walk anywhere within 30-40 minutes. We stayed here about 2 years ago but I'm not too sure if I would stay here the next time given the sporadic problems we had. On the same visit 2 years ago we also stayed at another nearby hotel which was very nice. Considering that the both hotels are in the same price range, I would probably stay at the other facility if we return to the area again.Also, as stated in the other reviews, parking is very expensive here- including tax, etc. it came to $42. for one night. If you are renting a car, I would consider your rental timing carefully. For me, to have the car just sitting on the parking lot for $42. would be a waste of my money. San Francisco is very pedestrian friendly and the public transportation is easy to use. We rented a car on the last day to visit Napa Valley and were driving down the Pacific Coast the following day."

10,2142,"Oct 9 2009 	The Radisson Fishermans Wharf	The hotel was comfortable, quiet, clean, free wi-fi, helpful concierge, very near the F line trolley which takes you all the way thru the central area &amp; ends up in the castro.Could not say anything negative about this hotel. The Radisson in Europe tend to be very modern, new &amp; minimalist. This hotel was not up to the European standard for the chain however, was still a good standard of decor, cleanliness with a very comfy bed."
11,2142,"Oct 8 2009 	Conveniently located especially if you love the ocean and sourdough!	My hubby had a business trip, and our tot and I went along. We had a wonderful little get-away; so glad to have had the opportunity to stay within walking distance to so much to see and do! Across the street is Boudin's Bakery and Cafe/Store/Restaurant and a short walk away is Pier 39 in all its glory!"
12,2142,Oct 8 2009 	Great Location!!!	This hotel is in the middle of all the attractions and restaurants in the fisherman's warf area of San Francisco. The hotel is old but in good condition and our room was clean and we had a great view of the bay out our window.The only problem we had was with the wifi connection. It did not work very well and we spent lots of time on the phone with a technical support person trying to get it to work.
13,2142,"Oct 8 2009 	Wish I could have stayed longer	The hotel was perfectly located, making everything within walking distance! We loved the accessibility to so many things, the recommendations made by the concierge for a little local restaurant for breakfast was perfect, the entire trip ended up being the the trip of alifetime!"

15,2142,"Oct 7 2009 	Great Location --- Average Hotel	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights as part of the tour ---- as we travelled with a large group ---- we were given various room types --- our room was a standard room with view to the car park. Room 2005 on second floor no balcony I saw some rooms have balcony with pool view anyway our room was small but ok for 2 nights only one thing I have to mention is an air-condition in our room was very filthy and noisy I can see lots of dust inside --- bathroom was also small but not too bad. This hotel does not have restaurant on-site but very easy to get around because it is in the perfect location --- if you looking for a good breakfast go to IHOP next to the hotel on the left hand side. Location of this hotel is absolutely perfect whatever you want to do ---- it's close to Cable car station, Pier 41 for Alcatraz etc.. On the back entrance of this hotel is towards fisherman's wharf so many bars and restaurants around --- especially Pier 39 we went to Fog Harbor Fish House for dinner it's on 2nd floor nice meal &amp; service with a very good view too ---- also we ate at Neptune Palace the same at Pier 39 very nice with beautiful view to Alcatraz.. Overall average stay but if you looking for better standard hotel try Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf opposite Radisson --- we went to have a look their room very nice. If we come back to San Francisco we will try better hotel next time."
16,2142,"Sep 30 2009 	Good hotel expensive parking and slow internet	Good hotel, excellently located for the tourist traps around Pier 39. Very, comfortable beds and nicely appointed room. But $37.50 charge per night for parking can make a big dent in your budget and the internet connection is so slow it is virtually unusable."
17,2142,"Sep 28 2009 	Good Location and excellent value	After reading several of the other reviews about the Radisson we were not expecting alot just a clean functional room. Somewhere just to shower and sleep. After a friendly check in we were so pleased to find that the room was not just a cupboard with a bed in it but fairly spaceious, very clean and well appointed. The bed was extremley comfortable and we had no problems with any noise. We stayed for 5 nights and found the location to be excellent. The only down side is that the pool does spend alot of the day in the shade but is more than ample for a quick splash and swim. Here are a few tips if this is your first visit to San Francisco. Book your tour trip to Alcatraz on line before going, it really is worth the trip. Don`t worry about taxis from the airport just leave the departure area and share a mini van. Its cheaper and just as good. We found a great place for breakfast which is less than two minutes walk from the hotel. Tuen right through the hotel main entrance and walk two blocks up to Taylor Street. Cross over and turn right. Darrens Cafe is on the left and does a great breakfast and the coffee is really good to. David Kim is the owner/cook and he does the eggs to perfection.I would really recommend the open bus tour within the first couple of days. It gives you a great overlay of the city but it does get chilly when you go over the Golden gate Bridge. This is a brilliant city to visit, hotel is ideally located and I don`t know why some of the other reviews &quot;down&quot; this hotel as it is quiet undeserved. Everyone we met was so friendly and helpful. Finally three things you must do, ride the cable cars and shop in the Levi store and do not forget to say hi to the Sea Lions at Pier 39 which is just 5 minutes away from the hotel."
18,2142,"Sep 27 2009 	Beware credit card rip off	I'm sorry to say that even though we found this hotel quite nice, a good location particularly. We were dismayed to find by accident ( we went on line to check) that when we had checked in they had taken $150 from our credit card for incidentals. They didn't tell us this at any time, I was expecting them to take an imprint of the card in case of incidentals ( which we had no intention of incurring) Our hotel had been prepaid before we arrived so there should have been nothing to pay. I had to ring their accounting department from our next stop to find out what was going on. It took over a week for the money to be credited back."
19,2142,Sep 26 2009	left my heart in san fran	great location right down by the water and all attractions could be a little cheaper but it is a hotel in san francisco so not bad
20,2142,Sep 22 2009 	Good Location...	Only stayed for 1 night. using my Goldpoints account. Rooms look a bit dated but are spacious. Excellent location which makes it a good stay for people who don't want to travel in each day. Staff were helpful.No restaurant in hotel so used IHOP restaurant next door for breakfast.
21,2142,"Sep 21 2009 	Location Location Location!	Couldn't have a better location for a first-time visit to San Fran. It is right in Fisherman's Wharf so there was lots to see and do within walking distance! We also bought a Sightseeing 2 day pass on the &quot;Hop On Hop Off&quot; tour bus and it was great!The rooms were roomy with sleep number beds. It could have used a little bit of an update to the decor but what you pay for is the location. Besides, how much time do you really want to spend in your room anyway?"
22,2142,"Sep 20 2009 	Convenient location room was comfortable	Stayed for three nights 11th 12th 13th September. Got the room using points. Worked out well. It is conveniently located and we liked the wharf area, plenty of interesting things to see especially at night the area is buzzing with people and you walk right out onto the street. The room I thought was good, we didn't get one of the balcony rooms the room actually looked directly into a car park but you could see the tower and city skyscrappers. Overall it met our needs and was comfortable. Parking is expensive $40 per night but convenient.We ate breakfast at Ihop next door for two days which was good and then walked to Pat's cafe which was excellent on the third day."
23,2142,"Sep 19 2009 	Great View but expensive and tatty	This hotel is in a key position in Fishermans Wharf. We stayed in bay view rooms with a balcony, the view of the bay was good with a glimpse of the bridge on a fine day. The rooms were very 'tired' and could have done with some modernisation, it was all a little tatty. If we hadn't got a view room we would have stayed in the Hyatt which has much better facilities , is cheaper, and only two blocks back from Fishermans Wharf."
24,2142,"Sep 19 2009 	Just the Basics but Great Location	I would actually rate this hotel somewhere between Average - Good. This hotel is in a great location and I felt very safe there. The room was clean and the front desk staff was nice. The problems I had were 1)the mattresses are extremely uncomfortable and that fact can not be fixed with the nice linens they provided 2) the hotel parking lot sits on the Wharf - I didnt understand why the hotel itself did not face the Wharf but there is probably a reason, like noise from the Wharf, which we did not experience since we had the parking lot as a buffer! 3) the rooms are teeny tiny. We found this hotel on hotwire and paid around $120/night, but anything higher than that I would have felt a little overpriced. I would stay here again simply because of the location. I felt close to all the tourist attractions. I did not find the Union Square area to be very &quot;happening&quot; in the evenings so I did not feel like I was missing out on something by being near the Wharf."
25,2142,"Sep 14 2009 	Not so sure about Fisherman's Wharf	We had a nice stay at this hotel but we weren't really sure about the location. The location was very convenient for Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, F Streetcar and the cablecars, however, as we were there over Labor Day weekend it meant that Fisherman's Wharf and the streets surrounding it were total mayhem which didn't endear it to us.The hotel itself was comfortable and clean but very basic. All in all a pleasant stay but I'm sure there are better hotels for the money."
26,2142,"Sep 8 2009 	Great View	The hotel is a few feet from the wharf and we had a very nice view. The rate was very good for that area. I tried a few other hotels in the area but they were full. I would stay there again if I could not find something else newer. It was a little old but it looks like at some point they did an inside remodel. The hotel is probably the closest to the wharf in San Francisco. We have been there many times and love it, but next time we are going to stay up by Union Square for the shopping. The only negative was the long lines at the front desk; I went by it numerous times during our 4 day stay and I would say that the wait was always 20 minutes. The rooms are very small."
27,2142,Sep 6 2009 	Excellent location across the street from Fisherman's Wharf!	We stayed at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf on our vacation to Northern CA. This was our first time staying at a Radisson and it was a nice place to stay. The hotel appears dated from the outside but inside the rooms are nice and clean with modern amenities. You can't beat the location since you can walk out from the swimming pool/courtyard area right onto Fisherman's Wharf! We did not have a room with a water view so instead we looked out onto the street and could see the bus/trolley station below. That didn't bother us since we kept the curtains closed and were out walking and sightseeing most of the time anyway. There are excellent views of Alcatraz from the Radisson parking lot. The rate for this hotel was very competitive for the location at a AAA rate of $125.10 per night plus $38.90 per night for parking. Hotels in San Fran are very overpriced so this was a deal! They do have free wi-fi so we enjoyed that. The bed was clean and comfortable. In fact it was so comfortable we didn't even try out the Sleep Number feature because it was already at an ideal setting. The bathroom is clean with recently redone floors and lots of counter space. We would definitely stay here again!
28,2142,"Aug 27 2009 	Great value hotel in a terrific loation	We got this hotel through a deal on Hotwire, so we paid under $50 a night. It was a perfectly good and clean hotel. Great location, staff were very friendly and more than helpful when we needed to know about the public transport system."
29,2142,"Aug 25 2009 	Hotel needs help.	Upon arrival the front desk staff were friendly and helpful, even though they had us booked for 4 rooms instead of 2. It was resolved after I showed my confirmation paperwork, so take this along for check in issues. As a Gold Points Radisson member, I found it odd that the front desk attendant asked me several questions about how the program works....maybe she was new. Only having 1 night in town, we promptly dropped our bags in our room upon arrival, and hit the streets. Hotel is in a great location. It was not until much later when we returned and got in bed, that we realized that our room reeked of mildew, and the airconditioning vent was so covered with black dust/dirt, that we were actually afraid to turn it on and go to sleep. Thanks God the wharf is cool at night. We toughed it out since it was only a 1 night stay, but if it was longer, we definitely would have had to change rooms and hope for the best. This hotel is close to the saying &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; but we were expecting it to be a little nicer, since it wasn't cheep and is a Radisson. Reminded us of the dive hotels down the Jersey shore that we'd stay in as teenagers, but unfortunately we're not any more. Its the perfect place if you just need a crash pad for a night at a decent price in the wharf."
30,2142,"Aug 23 2009 	Great location friendly staff 	My husband and I stayed at the Radisson four nights and it was a very positive experience. The location is perfect, one block from Fisherman's Wharf. Ihop, Johnny Rockets, Subway, and 7-11 are on the same block. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were on the 4th floor, corner room and had a fantastic view of the city. We had read about the loud A/C, so came equipped with earplugs. The bed &amp; pillows were extremely comfortable. The room was small, but was adequate. Most importantly, the room was very clean. Yes, we would definitely stay at this hotel again."
31,2142,"Aug 23 2009 	As on the Moon "" Location Location Location.	The Hotel is a bit ordinary, A square box as such, nothing special but the rooms are adequate even if a little small. We stayed there for our 2 week holiday in July 2009. WE Would not go back to this hotel if we were looking for luxury but it's location made up for everything else. Our concergierg was amazing. His name was Ron Davis. When we askes A simple question about an area in SF we got a complete history. A really nice and interested man. Radisson You should look after him . He is a treasure. There is so much to see and do in the area that you should not dwell on the short cominging about this hotel. It is ok for sleeping purposes. If you are in SF this hotel is where you need to be."
32,2142,"Aug 18 2009 	Great location- homely if a bit dated	This is a workmanlike hotel i.e. provides a decent room, solid service in a great location.

33,2142,"Aug 17 2009 	Location location location	Our first impression of this hotel was old and outdated. However, the staff were very friendly and informative. The beds were hard. The carpet had a very wet and sticky area that we informed the front desk about and were told they would take care of it while we were out, but surprise they never did. This hotel was not a usual Raddison but for the price it was o.k...As for the comment from the honeymooners who had time to inspect behind the toilet paper roll, didn't you have better things to do on your honeymoon?? Don't know if I would stay at this hotel if not for the location."
34,2142,"Aug 15 2009 	Super location	The best part of this hotel is the location. Only a few blocks from the Wharf, Pier 39, the cable car turn around, restaurants, shops and even a grocery store. The hotel itself is very dated. We were fortunate to have paid less than $150/ night which is pretty good in San Francisco. Therefore our expectations weren't that high. We were on the second floor and the view out our window was that of headlights of the cars parked in the lot outside. The floor in the room did appear grungy. The bathroom was clean and updated compared to the rest of the place. There might have been noise, but we were so tired after walking the city each day, we didn't have trouble sleeping. I didn't mind the fact that a restaurant wasn't in the hotel, because we prefer to eat at the local establishments and there were plenty nearby. Had we paid more, I would have been disappointed with the quality. However, if I got another good price like I did this time, we would stay there again."
35,2142,"Aug 15 2009 	Listen to the other reviews	This hotel has to be one of the poorest excuses for a Radisson. Don't go by the photos. Had 6 nights booked, was fortunate to leave after 2 nights and go to the Argonaut Hotel on the Wharf. A little more money but oh, so worth it. At the Radisson, had the bay front room. Yes over the parking lot where everyone did their smoking. Had to keep the window closed at all times. One review mentioned an odor in the room. It was not smoke, I don't know what it was but it came into the room at night even with the window open. Smelled like a sewer. The carpet was very soiled. The control to the bed was missing. Some guy from maintenance finally found it under the bed and blamed the maid. If you closed the window, your choice was this musty wall a.c. that was very loud. The lobby was a joke. Suitcases all over the place, no place to sit. Only about 6 chairs anyway. At arrival, some guy came out to greet us at the cab, then left. We thought he was going to get a cart. Never returned. If you wanted a cab, you had to wait in the line at the front desk to ask them to call a cab. This waiting could be as long as 20 minutes. No restaurent on site. Johney Rockets and I Hop next door. The photo of the pool looks large. It is not. Sitting outside is for the smokers. If you don't smoke, it is miserable. Don't even try this place. Go to the Hyatt, a block away, Holiday Inn down the street or the Argonaut. Even the Sheraton has to be five star compared to this place. Raddison needs to completely renovate this dump! Shame of them. Thank goodness we were able to move hotels, otherwise, we would have gone home to Orange County (CA). I&quot;m really nervous about ever staying in another Raddison, anywhere. Listen to the others."
36,2142,"Aug 11 2009 	Excellent location for family break	I found this hotel good value for money. OK there are a lot of complaints on here ....with comments like &quot; stay at the Hilton &quot; ....I would be surprised if the Hilton was available at the same price as this hotel.With children aged 7 and 10 the location was excellent , especially with the access right on to the wharf.....the beds are very comfortable and I found the staff very friendly......The pool is a bit small but the kids loved it and did not stay in too long ......Only downside in my opinion is there is no bar or lounge area.......apart from that it is ideal for a short family break,."
37,2142,"Aug 10 2009 	V disappointing: Shabby grimeyy noisy and poor value - there are many better options	I stay in lots of hotels and mostly don't write reviews - I only do so when I think a place is particularly deserving of praise or of having its shortcomings highlighted.We chose to end our 3 week honeymoon roadtrip staying in smaller, cheaper places with 3 nights here, having had good experiences with many other Radisson hotels. We had read some reviews but based on our previous experiences elsewhere figured it would be perfectly ok even if not the most stylish place - we just wanted a good night's sleep in a good location. Even with this modest expectation we were very disappointed.The prime location is the only reason I can think of that they can get away with keeping such a shabby place - we stayed in better maintained, fresher, more attractive motels at a fraction of the price. It looks like it was decorated by a depressed person in the 70's and not changed since. I twice saw the housekeeping staff needing help to lift their ancient, grubby carts with fresh towels and linen on the grubby rickety shelves beside dirty mops over the lip into the elevator. One of the ladies told me they had been asking for new carts for ages but no joy.- NOISY: We had a room on the 4th floor on the Beach Road side. The crappy, thin windows made it sound like every street car and truck was trundling right through our room. As others have said here, you hear everything from the hall, all the stomping and chatting and vacuuming. We bought ear plugs, didn't help much. Could not get a good night's sleep.The air con is really loud too - so loud in such a small room that we just didnt use it, even though we only wanted it on for half an hour to cool down the stuffy room a little.- SHABBY: I went to gently pull back the musty old net curtain to look out the filthy dirty window and the crappy cheap rail fell right off the window. The first view when entering the room was a giant, unsightly built-in-highschool-carpentry-class TV-wardrobe unit standing several inches from the wall with the back panel simply ripped open at the bottom to sticky, dusty cables from the TV to spill through. There was just enough space between this unit and the wall to carefully inch our case through the gap.Had to firmly shut the wardrobe door several times before it would finally stay shut - couldn't leave it open as it would then block the tiny passage way between the end of the bed and the TV unit.- GRIMEY: Only surfaces in immediate view were clean - every other nook and cranny behind doors, under desks, sinks etc had not had a good clean for a long time. There were clumps of grime in the space behind the toilet roll holder where they put a new roll to try and hide it - that is just sloppy work, a simply wipe in the corners every day and such lumps of grime could not build up. The location is good although in hindsight I would prefer to have been a few blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf - obviously nothing the hotel can do about that! There are many better options very close by.The bed was comfortable enough but nothing to rave about. Front desk and concierge staff were fine, nothing outstandingly awful but nothing outstandingly good either. And that's it. $45 a day parking, $5 for 10 mins internet in the lobby, $200 for a shabby, noisy, grimey room we couldn't wait to get away from - There are just not enough pro's to make up for this con."
38,2142,"Aug 9 2009 	noisy in every aspect no food or drink very expensive	very noisy old a/c unit , bathroom fan,could hear next door running water at all hours ,children allowed to run up and down corridors at all hours, doors banging early mornings.no restaurant or bar.or room fridge. very expensive for what you get a total rip off. our advice is go somewhere else like the Hilton we have used the one in LA it far outstrips this dump."
39,2142,"Aug 6 2009 	Great location - great hotel	I travelled in the peak for a long weekend in SF. Fishermans Wharf is fantastic location with great views (not from the hotel but just across the road). Hotel was right in the action. No complaints! Front desk were prompt and courteous, room was clean and well fitted out. The bed was the most comfortable that I had for my trip - I slept 8 hrs solid the first night. It was like sleeping in a cocoon at the soft setting. Easy access to restaurants and take away. Just a shame that San Fran is so cold in summer - I was not able to use the swimming pool. Internet access included which is a bonus."
40,2142,Aug 5 2009 	ideal location	What a perfect location - the hotel was friendly and clean and the concierge was extremely helpful when my daughter broke her arm. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and the girls loved the adjustable beds we also had a great view of Alcatraz. The TV had a limited number of channels. Breakfast next door at IHOP was brilliant
41,2142,"Aug 4 2009 	Excellent in every way!	Friendly check-in, extremely helpful concierge who gave excellent tips and directions, wonderful maid service. Nice, warm pool for the kids, while the adults enjoyed the fire pits. We were hesitant after reading some of the reviews, but we had none of the negative experiences posted by other people. Central location to all we wanted to do on Fisherman's Wharf. We stayed 4 nights, and would highly recommend this to others."
42,2142,"Aug 3 2009 	What a rip-off!	First, I should say the positives. The staff on the check-in desk were great and the concierge was very helpful.What I didn't like.Booking the hotel suggests rooms with abay view. Theree are only 15 acxcording to the check-in desk.Our room 2079 seemed to be right opposite where the dumpsters were picked up. Early!On 3 mornings a week they street clean between 12 a.m and 6 a.m. Just great!No facilties fro breakfast. You have to go next door to IHOP or some such. Poor!Want a kettle to make tea? No can do. You have to get some hot water, go and buy some milk or go down the road. Or you are given the option to use the coffe jug and boil water in that! Tea that tastes of coffee? No than you.Do they not understand that English people like tea? Don't they get toursists?OK so I know the English are strange and arrogant, but does a hotel need to exact revenge for our indiscretions.Parking? Rip-off!Throughout our whole stay in the USA all hotels were better value and had more facilities than the Radisson. It was suppose to be a highlight staying close to Fisherman's wharf with bay views. Ha ha ha!Radisson, you could learn from Holidya Inn Express, Days Inn and any number of small private hote;s you compete against."
43,2142,"Aug 2 2009 	Well situated	Not too bad in my opinion, well situated close to Pier 39. Nothing remarkable either way really. Our breakfast was in the adjoining IHOP and I have to say it was the best breakfast we had in the states - hot, fresh and tasty."
44,2142,"Jul 27 2009 	Don't Stay Here!!	Our room was tiny, the ancient air conditioning unit was extremely noisy, the vent in the bathroom was attached to the only bright light and was also very loud. The check in clerk told us there was no way to change rooms even though we checked in early and were there for two nights. The room looked out over the parking garage roof as many of the rooms did. The ice machine was broken. The halls were dark and depressing. There are many hotels in this area of town. Choose another one."
45,2142,"Jul 27 2009 	Dated but ok.	As I said in the subject the decor is a bit dated. The hotel also smelt a bit funny but nothing to be concerned about. If you want the &quot;touristy&quot; area of Fishermans Wharf you couldnt be in a much better location, it's just out the back door.I did have to make 3 trips to reception before I could actually get into my room as there was a problem with my room key. The girl in reception was very helpful but the concierge didn't have a clue.It's not a bad spot and depending which side you are on you will either have a view of the city or alcatraz."
46,2142,"Jul 12 2009	Never Again.	where would you like me to start?rooms: Average, lovely view over looking the car parks. Thin walls and ceilings, uncomfortable beds, not a lot of closet room. Bathroom was okay but that's about it.Maids: well a lot of things kept disappearing from my room- nothing of value which was weird but my clothes kept disappearing. they didn't close the bathroom door so that when you returned you opened the main door and hit the bathroom door so that the main door rebounds into you.Staff: Asked for a 5am wake up call as we had booked a trip to Yosemite costing over $300, luckily i had set an alarm on my phone because reception failed to phone and wake us up. They were NOT apologetic whatsoever when we complained they saw it as well you're up so what it matter now. whenever you entered the hotel/lobby there was no friendly welcomes no nothing. Location: yes its good to be on Fisherman's Wharf however you can get the bus down from Union Square which is fast and cheap and have a better hotel. Gym: What a joke. An old worn out treadmill and a few weightsSwimming pool: for mice it's so small."
47,2142,"Jul 12 2009 	Fantastic Location	We stayed at the Radisson for 3 nights and loved it. The room wasn't the biggest or nicest that we've ever stayed in but it was very clean and the location was the best. The room was on a fairly quiet street and then you go out by the pool and thru a door way and you are on Fisherman's Wharf! The seals, Alcatraz, street performers, all right there. We loved the location, we walked to Pier 39 and to the cable cars, both easy walks and my husband wears leg braces and walks with a cane. The number of hotels and entertainment with in easy walking distance was great. The double decker bus tour was right outside our door. And when we left we walked across the street to Dollar Rental and picked up our car. I highly recommend this hotel."
48,2142,"Jul 10 2009 	I really wanted to like this hotel......	As usual, before our trip, I came to Tripadvisor to read the reviews. We really had a desire to stay near fisherman's wharf and weighed the pros and cons of the Radisson and the surrounding hotels. Also, I found that the Radisson had a King Tut package that seemed great - it included two tickets to the King Tut exhibit at the DeYoung Museum and two tickets to the Wax Museum just down the street from the hotel. Also included was parking. Oh, and the other factor in the Radisson's favor was that they now have Sleep Number beds! That fact sealed the deal!Well.......where do I start.....The hotel is across the street from the bay, and the majority of rooms do not have a bay view. I paid more for a balcony and got a courtyard view which was better than a view of the street or parking area. The room was small and had two double sized beds. They were sleep number but only had one controller for each bed, not one controller for each side of the bed as the queen and king beds do. I now can say that I do not like that type of bed. It was very hard to adjust and very noisy - - I was awake at 12 midnight listening to other guests in adjacent rooms adjusting their beds. Think of a leaf blower and that is the sound that it makes when it is inflating! - - The bathroom was very dated and the wallpaper was peeling in three different locations. There was mold on the grout near the bathtub....I would say it was comparable to a motel bathroom, not hotel. - - The aircondtioning sytem was a window system with a thermostat ... we either sweltered or froze in the middle of the night. - - Our card key would not work to let us into the hotel from the parking lot, so my husband had to walk way out of our way to let us into the hotel and our room. - - The maid knocked on our door at 8:30 a.m. on our morning of checkout to see if we were still there. Unfortunately, we were.There was a plus! There is a Johnny Rocket restaurant that can be accessed through the back of the hotel. It was a great treat for my daughter as she played the jukebox on our table.The only other plus I can think of is the location. It is on Fisherman's Wharf.Next time, I think we will be staying in one of the nicer hotels near Union Square and taking the cable car or taxi. This place was a nightmare."
49,2142,Jul 8 2009 	Enjoyed My Stay	This hotel was a good value. The room was a nice size and comfortable. It has a safe in the room and free internet. The sleep number bed was very comfortable. I booked a room on the courtyard and was surprised to find a good-sized balcony where we could sit and enjoy the weather. You cannot beat the location for access to everything San Francisco has to offer.
50,2142,"Jul 3 2009 	Good location but.....	Great location near fisherman's wharf etc however the hotel is in need of complete renovation. Seems stuck in a drap 1980's timewarp - OK if you like Duran Duran but otherwise not.... Cleaniliess in the bathroom left a little to be desired, we found dark black hairs on the the shower and bathroom floor which would be alright if we had black hair but as we don't we were left wondering whose they were and how well the room was cleeaned.Very noisy hotel room. We were woken at about 5 am each morning when the bins were emptied and then the trams started. The whole room also shook anytime a large vehicle passed by. Think the hotel should be completely taken apart, renovated and updated to give it a clean modern feel."
51,2142,"Jun 27 2009 	Perfect location pity about the service.	Location-directly on Fishermans Wharf-is great, but you feel that the staff make far less effort because people will keep coming back anyway. Resrvations were not run together twice despite asking, so keys kept cancelling, leaving us stranded with bags of shopping outside our room (would not have been such a problem if the lifts were not so busy and SLOW) or with a queue behind us at the parking barrier. Internet dodgy, to say the least, and maids had the annoying habit of knocking on the door EVERY morning to ask if we were checking out, and if so, when."
52,2142,Jun 26 2009 	OK	The hotel is selling location. They are right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf. I was able to work the internet to find a reasonalbe price of $100/night. This sounds good until you factor in parking. at +$40/night the value for staying was definately deminished. The hotel is an older building but the rooms are clean and adequately furnished. Starbucks and Safeway supermarket (sells beer and wine) are 2/3 blocks away.
53,2142,"Jun 23 2009 	great locationbut nothing else	stayed at the wharf on the 16th. Got a pretty good price of 130.00 a night. what you pay for is the location, it is right across the street from the wharf. most of the rooms are not bay views. if you take a car it is an extra 45 a night including tax. you do not need a car if you are staying here, so don't get one. the sleep number was nice, did not hear and disturbing noises because of thin walls. if i had to do it again i would stay at the holiday inn, it has a free breakfast, parking was not as expensive and it is a block from the wharf. or i would rent a car stay across the golden gate and take a ferry to the wharf if ou wan to see it. best view to eat on the wharf was bubba gumps, food was over priced but everything is in san fran. i can only recommend this hotel for the location."
54,2142,"Jun 18 2009 	Radisson Fisherman's Wharf	For our honeymoon trip I booked the 'bay view' room for a week at Radisson Fisherman Wharf. The bay view also included the hotel car park though, which wasn't quite what I had in mind.For $280-$300 a night, the room looked like it had been frozen in time since in about 1985. Very poor value and not a place that I would recommend to any traveller at these prices.You COULD just about swing a cat around in the bathroom, though the soggy toilet paper - caused from the water dripping from the basin next to the toilet - would surely have cushioned the moggy's impact.The fitness centre though had curiosity value, as the equipment looked like it had been been shipped over from the prison when it closed in 1962. More a museum than a gym in my opinion.The location (directly opposite Pier 39) was the hotel's only saving grace. Avoid at all costs otherwise."
55,2142,"Jun 17 2009 	Great location - great value!	My wife and I stayed here our first time in San Francisco. The location was close to everything and easy to get to public transportation to tour the whole city. Even took BART and the trolley right to the door from the airport. Rooms are clean and newly redone, nothing special, but certainly more than adequate. The concierge was so helpful in giving directions and all of the staff very nice. Plenty to do and loads of touristy restaurants right on Fisherman's Wharf. Just a short trolley or cable car ride to fine dining."
56,2142,Jun 15 2009 	Location location	Unbeatable wharf location. Close to all shops/dining. Expensive parking. Rooms and bathroom a bit small but clean and comfortable. Nice balcony with two chairs/table view of bay and city. Front desk staff was very fast and pleasant. Very cozy outdoor fire pit area that was perfect to sit by with a drink and relax after seeing all the sights.
57,2142,"Jun 15 2009 	Great staff.	The staff was very nice and helpful. We got there early and they let us check in well before check in time. The rooms were a little small but they served the purpose for my husband and myself. We really didn't like area to much, Fisherman's Wharf was too crowded to stay at for any length of time. Plus the restuarant in the area were a little too expensive. The outdoor area in the hotel was nice, it had a fire pit and wicker furniture around it. We sat out there a lot at night."
58,2142,"May 27 2009 	Noisy 	we stayed for 4 days &amp; were unfortunate to pick the same few days as a 160 strongyouth choir from Michigan.. they absolutely ran amok the first night ..shouting &amp; running up and down corridors until about 4.00am..then the dust cart started collecting rubbishoutside..we did,nt get any sleep the first night..several people were complaining at the front desk &amp; we added our views..the choir leaders were approached by the management &amp; the second night was quieter.. but the third night was even worse than the first night..we heard there was a fight between Hotel guests &amp; choir members on the floor below..we certainly would not go back..to this Hotel or fishermans wharf"
59,2142,"May 26 2009 	Superb location but very limited facilities	Hotel was in ideal location for Fisherman's Wharf with a back door leading out to Jefferson Street. Our room had fantastic views of Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge, but we did have to pay a very high room rate to secure that. Disappointing that there was no bar or restaurant at the hotel."
60,2142,May 25 2009 	Average hotel great location	We hadn't planned on staying in San Francisco on this trip but ended up leaving wine country early. We did no research we just did a search on our navigation it was very close to pier 39 so we checked they had room a decent price. The hotel was nice for the most part we had easy access to our car there is also an IHOP on the corner nice for breakfast. The only thing we didn't like was that the layout of the hotel wasn't the best. Other than that good stay.
61,2142,"May 23 2009 	Great Location	Radisson is a great no frills hotel right in the middle of the &quot;tourist trap&quot;. That said, it is within walking didtance of all the piers etc around Fishemans wharf. Good value."
62,2142,"May 6 2009 	Wouldn't consider anywhere else	We are in our early fities, and this was our first trip to SF. I did a tremendous amount of research to prepare our itinerary. Our number 1 priority was to stay &quot;on the water, with a view from our room,&quot; so we chose the Radisson after looking at the pictures on various websites of the &quot;waterfront&quot; hotels. We stayed in room 4117, and I can't even begin to tell you what a tremendous view we had ( Alcatraz , Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf people watching spot, and the magnificent Pacific sunsets.) Yes --- it's not the latest and greatest hotel in SF, but that doesn't matter to us. We're willing to sacrifice to get what we want. Our room was as clean as most of the places we've stayed in, and every employee we met throughout our stay went out of their way to say &quot;hello&quot; and asked us if we needed any help. I originally had a reservation at the Argonaut (very highly rated, on the water.) However, I changed it to the Radisson because it was 1/2 the cost, and I just couldn't see the &quot;waterfront&quot; on the Argonaut pictures. We walked down to the Argonaut one day to check it out, and we just didn't see how any of their rooms' views could possibly compare to ours. I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else if we ever go back to San Francisco (an incredibly fun/educational/scenic vacation, by the way!)"
63,2142,"Apr 24 2009 	Great Location..but...	This is undoubtedly a great location. Right on Pier 39 and it's quick and easy to catch the F trolleys to downtown. That said...at first we thought the rooms were great and quiet. Until the weekend. The sleep number beds are a play thing and you can hear them blowing up through the walls. Also...it was a bit noisy. We could hear the traffic and street sounds through the windows. The rooms are definitely in need of some upkeep but not disgusting by any means. Black marks on the walls..bit of wear and tear in the bathrooms etc. The staff was nice, when not swamped. There seemed to be a line for everything, the concierge, the front desk, coffee. It's a busy hotel. While you have a great location...the hotel experience is just nothing exciting. There are several hotels in the area that are just as close and easy to reach as this Radisson. When we go back to San Francisco we will most likely stay at a hotel away from the wharf and closer to Market street. In order to use public transportation anywhere..the trains, buses and trolleys all headed to Market street, so it would be much more central. Also while the wharf is fun..it's pricey to eat and spend much time there. It's such an easy place to get to via trolley that I wouldn't worry about staying a bit further away. Positives: The pool was nice, clean and warm. It was 91 degrees while we were there..so the pool was great."
64,2142,"Apr 22 2009	The best location to stay in!	This is the best hotel to stay in if one is a tourist and is looking to explore the city and its culture. It has the best view as soon as you step out the back entrance of the hotel which is pier 39 and the bay. Lots of great restaurants, great transportation of trams, street cars etc and best of all, everything is right there including an IHop. You can even walk to the Embarcadero which has this awesome Thai restaurant called Osha Thai and the Farmer's Market. And Johnny Rockets is right outside your door! The only flip side was that housekeeping chose to ignore the Do Not Disturb sign a couple of times. Staff is helpful and very cordial and the rooms are spotless and super clean with an adjustable pillow and mattress setting. Great price of a 100 dollars a night was the rate i got on the hotel website. Have gone back again since. 108070900"
65,2142,"Apr 14 2009 	Great location next to most attractions and short walk to cable car	Stayed there with the family for three nights and the location next to Pier 39 was excellent and we dine there two times. There was a 3-5 min walk to cable car stations and that was lot of fun and if visiting San Francisco again, I would choose the hotel only for that reason as well. Fisherman's Wharf area is cool even in the middle of Summer, so please be prepared for that."
66,2142,"Apr 10 2009 	Location...Location...Location	Stayed over the weekend of 4/4-4/6 and it was a fantastic part of our vacation. The weather was unusually perfect for SF...70's warm and sunny w/ no fog. The hotel is in the best &quot;tourist&quot; location by far. Across the street from the fish markets at Fisherman's Wharf, Boudin's Sourdough, and Pier 39. If you're traveling w/ kids, Pier 39 is more family oriented w/ many restaurants and the sea lions. It is also cleaner and safer...w/out the street people you'll see by the wharf (remember its a city) and within walking distance of streetcars, cable cars, and Alcatraz ferry. It's a Radisson and the rooms were clean, comfortable, and maintained. Updating or refurbishment will be necessary at some point but must be difficult as the hotel always seems to be booked due to its location. There is an IHOP restaurant and a Johnny Rockets connected to the Radisson which were both fine for breakfast. There are certainly nicer hotels in Union Square downtown but they seem to cater to business travelers. Overall, we would stay here again. The Holiday Inn, HI Express, Hilton, and Sheraton were nearby and looked to be comparable but are a few blocks in from the wharf. Unlike some other reviews, we did not find it to be noisy at all and the front desk staff were friendly."
67,2142,Apr 7 2009 	Good location but a bit needs updated	Stayed here for three nights. Location is great but hotel decor was disappointing. A bit drab. Room was average with a view of the car park. No bar just coffee bar which also does snacks. Outdoor sitting area was fine. has a gas burner for the colder evenings and a pool. Asked for a change of room for a view but the staff were not too accommodating. However the Conscierge was very helpful when ordering us a taxi. A really nice gentleman who even knew all the best lines from Clint films.
68,2142,"Apr 6 2009 	Great location	Great Hotel in best location. No fridge in room. Rang reception as from Australia where every room has fridge, they delivered one to room in 10 minutes, no cost."
69,2142,"Apr 6 2009	Great location""	My family and I stayed here in Nov. 2008 and were very happy with this hotel.It is located right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf and only steps awayto many restaurants and shops.The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful and seemed happy to have us asguests.A bellman helped with our luggage and gave us an overview as we walked to the room.We had a lovely view of Alcatraz and enjoyed watching the boats on the bay.The room was very spacious --especially the bathroom. It was one of the nicest hotelsbathrooms I've ever seen!The beds were very comfortable and our room had a mini fridge.We definately recommend this hotel."
70,2142,"Apr 2 2009 	Look Elsewhere...BOO-HISS	Okey, so the price was good cause I stayed 5 nights but you will get a room facing noisy Beach Street not the wharf unless you wish to pay the $250 and up price tag for the view rooms. Plugged my computer into their power strip over night and awoke to a fried hard drive... BRING YOUR OWN SURGE PROTECTOR. Beverage maching ate my money the first night, put a sign on machine and alerted the lobby... they took off the sign but didn't fix the machine... ever... No little fridge in room (or microwave) so that left us to cart gallons of bottled water for drinking (tap water sucked) and one or two cans of coke to sit in tiny ice bucket per day. Desk staff was surly but maids were pleasant and thorough."
71,2142,"Mar 30 2009 	Ideal location for short stay	Comfortable with great service and advice for visitors. Walk out of the door and have great choice of Ferry rides, tram routes, shops, restaurants,fish bars,and views of the Bay."
72,2142,"Mar 26 2009 	Best Family Location in SF	We've stayed in other locations in SF, but didn't feel as safe after dark as at the Radisson, as it's entrance is across the street from Pier 39. There was so much to do in the City with the family, that spending time in the hotel seemed like a waste of time, and location, cleanliness and safety were paramount. We were lucky to get a great deal online directly with the hotel, so it also scored on value. We walked through the Argonaut, the Sheraton and the Hilton to plan for our next trip, but the kids insist that we stay at the Radisson due to its prime location. We stayed on the east side on the fourth floor and had no concerns with noise, but I would stay away from rooms by the elevators."
73,2142,"Mar 17 2009 	Nice conveniently located hotel	Great location for exploring San Francisco and the surrounding area. The F-line street cars run straight past the hotel which is great for accessing the downtown area, but this does lead to some noise if you are in the front of the hotel.It is in the centre of Fisherman's Wharf so all the local attractions like Pier 39, restaurants and ferries are within 5/10 mins walk.There is a 7-11 round the corner for any essentials needed, with a larger supermarket (Safeway) a couple of blocks away.The historic cable cars are a few minutes walk away.I'd definitely recommend this hotel as a base for exploring the fantastic San Francisco."
74,2142,Mar 10 2009 	crummy hotel would never go back	how could this place ever get 3 stars no bar no restaurant no fridge. The rtoom appeared clean until you opened the curtains where there were layers of dust and we did not dare turn on the air con as it was solid with dust.To be fair staff were friendly and the location was good on the front and quiet but for nearly $200 a night I felt it was a complete rip off!
75,2142,"Mar 9 2009 	would not stay here again	The Hotel is in an excellent location, but is not worthy of being a Radisson hotel. The rooms are shabby, and dont expect a good nights sleep as the windows are not double glazed, and the noise from the traffic keeps you awake. The hotel is in the best location on pier 39, definately recommend the hotel due to its location, but sadly the hotel is in need of refurbishment."
76,2142,"Feb 26 2009 	grubby hotel but in a superb location for sightseeing	this hotel was shabby, service was bad and the swimming pool was too cold to use for more than a minute at a time.The room was clean but dated.I would not stay here again but if you were planning on not spending much time in it then it makes a good base for sightseeing but other hotels very nearby would probably be more comfortable."
77,2142,"Feb 21 2009 	Fantastic location!	This was by no means our first trip to San Francisco, but it was the first time we actually decided to find a hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area. We stayed at the Radisson and it fully met our expectations. Nice, comfortable rooms with all amenities, great and helpful staff and because of its location, having the entire city at your fingertips. Pier 39 and its attractions is right across the hotel, in fact we were woken every morning by the sounds of the famous sea lions over there. If you want to go Downtown, the historic streetcars of the F-line stop right in front of the hotel, and hop-on-hop-off sightseeing buses are just one block away.The hotel does not have a restaurant but with an IHOP next door and all the Fisherman's Wharf restaurants within walking distance, as well as a 7-11 convenience store around the corner, one does not really need one. The only drawback of the hotel is the rather poor soundproofing of the rooms, which, however, seems to be a feature of many SF hotels. We enjoyed our stay there and next time we will for sure try to go back!"
78,2142,"Feb 18 2009 	Not insulated for sound needs upgrades	I give this one a 2 star since it was at least clean and it is located in a great spot. It has nothing else going for it. As one of the reviews mentioned, this location is not what I consider to be Raddison quality. It is an old motor inn. Don't expect anything more. You can hear everything going on outside your room in the hallway and in the rooms next to you. The plumbing makes a substantial amount of noise. The card key access points at the various doors work inconsistently and sometimes take a few minutes to accept the card and/or open the door. I personally don't like sleep number beds and that is what we got. I woke up with my neck sounding like popcorn (inflammed). I was cranky after two nights of sleep and when we left with our car, we were locked out, even though we had paid for two full days (48 hours) of parking at check in. They &quot;reactivated&quot; our card so we could leave and said that it was good until 1 pm even though we had checked in at 4 pm two days before. (How nice of them. I think we still got swindled since 1 pm is only a full 45 hours in my mind.) Anyhow, expect to leave cranky and ready not to recommend this place to anyone. I am sticking to Best Westerns and Hyatts. Pay more and stay in the financial district. Even the Sheraton next door looked more appealing."
79,2142,"Feb 10 2009 	Best place to stay on Fisherman's Wharf!	We went to S.F. to celebrate our 12th wedding anniversary. We wanted a place that was reasonable priced, within walking distance of public transportation, and had a lot of areas to sight-see nearby. The Radisson was it. The staff was fast and friendly. When we asked questions, they had the answers. The courtyard was being updated and new furniture was brought in. They planned to have a fire pit installed by the end of the week-would have liked to see it! We had never been to S.F., so did all our research by internet. The room was on the small size, but we don't need a lot of room to sleep. Always clean. Public transportation w/in blocks of hotel. We were totally pleased and will recommend this hotel to our friends."
80,2142,"Feb 1 2009 	Great Location not radisson quality	We stayed at the Radisson Fishermans Wharf for 3 nights and adored our time in this beautiful city. The hotel is in a great location wereby it is peaceful and great for exploring but also has easy access to the city. The hotel is basic and not like a Standard Radisson in the UK. Rooms are clean, small and basic. There are not many facilities at the hotel- the pool is small and there is no restaurant only a food cart for breakfast. The hotel is great for a short stay if you just want to get out and explore. Ensure you get good value for money with this hotel as it is very similar to a travel lodge."
81,2142,Jan 18 2009 	Where to start???	Where to start??If you book with this hotel and are expecting to get a room overlooking the Bay (with or without a balcony) they are VERY limited. Even if you pay extra at the time of booking to get the room it is not guaranteed (which we found only on arrival). We had rang the accommodation a day before to confirm our room booking as it was our 1st Wedding Anniversary.Our flight was delayed leaving Vancouver and then our pre-booked transportation was also delayed so we arrived later than expected. We finally checked in at 8:00pm and with no one waiting it took half an hour to check in. After negotiating our way through the long corridors (rooms all packed in like sardines) we got to our room which was on the 2nd floor and to our surprise it had no Bay View which we had booked. After discussions with an assistant manager we were told we should have checked in earlier and was also told that calling a day before to confirm didnt guarantee our room even after they confirmed it. So at 10:00pm we were no better off.We hadnt eaten and asked for some directions for a place to get some food. The directions and information supplied where very disappointing. The next day we found that there was a Safeway Supermarket open until midnight one street over and one street over the opposite way was all the restaurants etc.We did finally get a room that overlooked the bay but it didnt have a balcony. It was to cold to use the pool which was not heated enough to go swimming. For peak time of year they were repainting the concrete around the pool area and was roped off most of our trip.In both rooms the exhaust fan was very noisy and at night you could hear it rattling and when advising the front desk the response given was maintenance would check it out but nothing came of it in our stay.The concierge(s) didnt really want to help and only really did for those who came in on a large bus tour bookings. There was no restaurant/dining area or bar unless you are happy to eat fast food. The only good thing about this place was the cleaning staff they did an exceptional job and were very polite.I really dont understand how this place has a high star rating as its service and ability to even care was way below the standards of other places we have stayed with a lesser rating.Unrelated to the accommodation: For those who are unaware some attractions e.g. Alcatraz can require pre-booking tickets up to a month before your visit day unless you get them through a street tour seller which comes with another attraction. And the bike riding companies who suggest you ride to Sausalito and catch the ferry back with the tickets supplied and timetable dont advise that there is a limited number of people with bikes that can get on the ferry and the later you get in to Sausalito the likelihood of actually getting a ferry back is not very high in peak season but it is a nice ride to do and well worth it if your fit.
82,2142,"Jan 2 2009	Great Location	The location is great (ask for a room with a Bay view, and you can see Pier 39, Alcatraz, etc.)The hotel is a bit of a rabbit warren with long widing corridors. Rooms fairly spacious, but all a little &quot;tired&quot; (the catch on the window fell off, some peeling paint).The extractor fan in the bathroom was extraordinarily powerful and noisy, creating a draft in the room. We put a dry flannel up to the vent and it stuck from the suction, which reduced the flow and noise a bit.We got good rates with an AARP discount, though parking is expensive (a San Francisco thing!).No proper breakfast available - go to the IHOP adjacent to the hotel rather than the overpriced breakfast buffet cart in the lobby."
83,2142,"Jan 1 2009	Great base to tour city	Stayed here for 4 nights in December.Our room over looked Beach street and like another reviewer mentioned was noisy with the sound of street car as not double glassed. However when in San Francisco you expect to hear that noise. It reminded where I was.We booked the hotel through our travel agent as part of a package deal on a cheap airfare to New York with a stop over in San Francisco which I had always wanted to visit.The hotel wasn't the cheapest of those given to choose from but had better reviews than others and based in Fisherman wharf area.Check in was easy and staff very friendly. The room was fine and clean which was what we wanted. The bed was big and one of those number beds.The area is easy to catch cable car, pier 39 close by and easy sight seeing.I hop next to hotel for breakfast which we went to once.Would stay here again if I needed to be in the area."
84,2142,"Dec 27 2008 	Great Location	My 18 year old daughter and I recently spent three nights at the Radisson, Fishermans Wharf. We were booked through our local AAA (Automobile Club of Southern California), who got us a fairly good price which included daily parking, and a $50.00 gift certificate for Macys. Having parking included in S.F. is a huge deal, since the normal daily rate is very expensive. Upon check in, the staff informed us that they had run out of the Macys gift certificates, but they would take the $50.00 off our tab. That was fine with us. Our room was fine, a little on the worn side, but otherwise no complaints. The location is excellent if you plan on spending time in the wharf area. The only time we drove was when we went to Golden Gate Park to go to the California Academy of Sciences, the newest museum there (extremly crowded, I won't go back until it has been open for a long time). Otherwise, we used the cable car, and could have used the trolleys. Our only complaint is that our room overlooked Beach Street which is very noisy because of the trolleys which run all day and night. The hotel does not seem to have double pane glass windows which would have helped with the noise level in the rooms. Be sure and ask for a room on the side or warf side of the hotel. This is not a fancy hotel, but it suited our needs. We would stay here again."
85,2142,"Dec 23 2008 	Good value hotel in a good location...	Good stay, nice rooms and free daily paper...Liked location to wharf. Car parking extremely expensive"
86,2142,"Dec 22 2008 	Location was great	Stayed here for 4 nights for a meeting. Check-in was quick and efficient, staff was friendly. The room was small but very clean and updated. There was some peeling paint on the ceiling. There was a power outage for about 3 hours while there, but was not hotels fault. Couple good restaurants very close buy, and all the shops of Pier 39 within a short walk. My room did look out on to the second level parking, but this was not that noisy. I could see Alcatraz from my window. Overall average experience, nothing special, nothing terrible."
87,2142,"Dec 20 2008 	It's OK but it is a motel really!	Bit of a mixed bag for a first visit to SF. As some have pointed out, this can't be taken as a 4* hotel. It has neither restaurant nor bar and only provides a breakfast cart in the morning - and the food is not free! We stayed at a Travelodge down the coast for half the price that had free breakfast but I suppose it must be remembered this is a tourist are in a big tourist city.The good: Location, if you want to be on Fisherman's Wharf. Rooms are OK.The less good: Overpriced, frankly. If you can afford a little more I would stay in a &quot;real&quot; hotel in the area. We arrived after the published check in time and the rooms were not ready and not the ones we asked for when they were available. We had asked for smoking rooms but they claimed to know nothing of this and couldn't accommodate us when it was mentioned. Instead of taking note of the issue and saying they would try to sort it they told us to ask the following day if any smoking rooms were available. My advice is actually don't stay on Fisherman's Wharf at all. It is a tourist trap area and has little in the way of after-dark entertainment. I suggest staying closer to Union Square and visit the area."
88,2142,"Dec 19 2008	I don't rate this hotel!!!	We stayed here as part of a tour, the last hotel of 7 it was supposed to be a four star but I certainly woudn't class it as that. One thing that really upset my stay was that they don't iron the sheets on the bed so you don't that they are clean and not from the night before. Location wise it was good but the hotel is very tired and in need of care and attention the staff wern't particularly helpfull"
89,2142,"Dec 17 2008 	Just what we wanted.	Booked through Southwest Vacations. Great central area, walking distance to trolley, bus service etc. Good neighborhood cafes for quick, affordable breakfast. Beach St. Restaurant our favorite for mornings. Ghiradelli Sq. and shops very close, excellent Vietnamese restaurant for dinner, called Ana Mandara Restaurant.Room comfortable, nice beds,quiet in hotel, refrigerator in room is helpful to save on meals out or for snacks. Grocery just around the corner for basics. Get room that overlooks pool, a bit noisy on the street side, but we were so tired each night, it wasn't a problem!Only complaint was you had to pay to use the internet in their office center in the lobby, not worth $5 plus to check personal e-mail. Free to print boarding pass, that was a nice feature.We arrived very early, 9 AM and planned to sight see, but checked with hotel and we were able to get into our room by 9:30 AM, staff very helpful and concierge knew the town and how to get there using the public transportation. Buy the muni-pass for 3 days (good on trolleys and all buses) and save on taxis and you can get everywhere you need to see, shop and eat!"
90,2142,"Dec 10 2008 	Not a 4* hotel but...	I just returned from a USA road trip, which included 5 nights at the Radisson at Fishermans wharf.As the header says, it's certainly not a four star hotel, but then again, you are not paying four star money to stay there.I paid less than $90 a night and had no problems what so ever with the hotel.My room was more than adequate. It was clean, quiet, and fairly spacious, and the hotel itself is located about as close to the wharf area as you can get.It's more of a motel than a hotel as there are no dining or bar facilities, but all you have to do is to walk out of the door, and there are endless places to eat and drink.All in all, I couldn't really find any fault with the place."
91,2142,"Nov 29 2008 	Fantastic Staff and Location	We stayed at Radisson on the first night of our trip to the U.S.A on the 14 November. We arrived at 10am after a long flight from Australia. Check in was a breeze and made so easy by the helpful and friendly staff at the front desk. They couldn't have been more helpful and friendly, our rooms were ready and we were able to go upstairs straight away and freshen up before exploring Fisherman's Wharf. The location was perfect, so close to everything it just made it so easy to come and go without a long walk to drop of purchases throughout the day.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, although the rooms are small and a little outdated they are spotlessly clean and the king room we had was more than large enough for a couple. The next morning after checking out we were able to have our luggage stored and the concierge was very helpful in organising a shuttle to the airport for us.I would definatley stay here again on our next trip to San Francisco."
92,2142,"Nov 14 2008 	Excellent Location	We stayed at the Radisson for four nights and have no complaints. It is ideally located on the wharf which, yes is a bit touristy but is perfect for walking around day or night and has the best views of the bay being on it. We hired bikes on the wharf and cycled all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge and over it. It was great. There is a cable car terminal at the end of the wharf too near the famous Ghirardelli chocolate shop.The hotel was clean, the room large with a balcony. We would have had a great view of the water if there wasnt a tree in the way too. The pool is large and again clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is not posh by any means but is better than average I would say. I would recommend it to anyone staying in San Francisco. There is a 7-11 and other eateries nearby too. The pier for tours to Alcatraz is about a ten minute walk from the hotel also. The only downfall is the expensive parking but anyone who can find a hotel without this let me know."
93,2142,"Nov 9 2008	Try somewhere else	This area of town is a bit seedy and very touristy which is great if that is what you are looking for. The hotel concierge, Ron, was excellent. The hotel is tired and very basic."
94,2142,"Nov 5 2008 	Need some refurbishment	Hotel is conveniently located a few walking minutes away from Fishermans Wharf so good location for a tourist. Check In/Out employees have been helpful and profesionnal. However, the furniture and the hotel itself is pretty worn down. There were holes in my curtains and dust on the furniture. Worse was probably that the walls are about as thick as a sheet of paper and that i could hear the neighbouring rooms..."
95,2142,"Nov 3 2008 	Good location pleasant hotel...	Myself and two friends stayed here for 5 nights and overall had a very pleasant stay. The location is very good and the room (albeit very cramped for 3 adults) was clean and the beds comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative point for me was that hotel does not have a restaurant or bar area, but as there are so many bars and restaurants in the area don't let that put you off. Pier 39 is literally 2 mins walk from Hotel."
96,2142,"Nov 3 2008 	Good hotel overall	My husband and I stayed two nights. The location is great, very close to the peers, trolly etc. The room is very spacious, bigger than the norm, service was good. The bed was average, in the hard side. Our room was 2000 close to the elevator, and we could hear the vibration/noise everytime it went up and down as well as noise from the street or parking and in addition there was weird noise coming from the ceiling (may be the neighbors from the floor above). Don't take me wrong, we were able to sleep fine, but if you are picky about noises, please make sure you tell them. The wireless internet is free but very slow. Please make sure to go to Buena Vista Pub about 5-6 blocks away and dring an Irish Coffee. We are both in our early 50's."
97,2142,"Oct 28 2008 	Best Location ever!	Hi, just returned from visit to San Francisco, staying at the Radisson, Fishermans Wharf, what a place! Firstly, the staff could not have been more helpful, on arriving they saw how tired we were and quickly got us booked in, the room was brilliant, HUGE bed, like 2 double joined together, really clean, tv, coffee machine, all you need really. The concierge at the hotel was brilliant, he booked our alcatraz tickets for us (youve got to go there) he booked our taxi to the airport on leaving and even checked us in online and prebooked our seats. nothing is a problem to these guys! The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic, as you walk out of reception, take the back way past the pool and a corridor leads you right out onto fishermans wharf! We could not believe how well placed it was.Attached to the hotel was a place called Johnny Rockets diner , a 50's inspired place, great burgers and breakfast too. The Wharf is brilliant, loads of shops, and about a 4 minute walk from the hotel is pier 39 with the sealions, and a boardwalk area with bars, restaraunts, shops,hard rock cafe and loads of characters! Brilliant atmosphere in the evenings, it is all lit up with fairy lights. So much to see and do, do it from this hotel, its brilliant."
98,2142,"Oct 24 2008 	Close to Fishermans Wharf	Good location on top of Fishermans Wharf. Be aware parking is $35+tax per night but parking in the area is premium....Rooms were clean, hotel staff friendly. Tip: f you wish to check in online for you flight before leaving (and don't have your own facility) there is a free facility to the left of Reception....unfortunately this was not in the Hotel info guide so we ended up using the Business centre and being charged accordingly. Would I go back there??? No, public transport is so good I would stay somewhere else (probably the Fairmont)on the Cable car route and commute around. Anyway I would recommend the Radisson.....it just wasn't for us."
99,2142,"Oct 22 2008	request denied.	hi ,request for bay view room totally ijnored,'but rooms were very clean .We stayed here four nights.Very handy for getting around .17 oct 2008 to 21 oct 2008. jim."
100,2142,"Oct 10 2008 	Great hotel	Booked this hotel through travel agent and then read reviews - nearly every review was negative and obviously quite concerned we had made a mistake. Been there, done that! now - to find that this hotel was in a fantastic position, the room large, very clean, the bed really comfortable and the staff friendly. Stayed for 5 nights."
101,2142,"Oct 4 2008 	Great Location...will return for sure	My husband and I flew down from Seattle for a mental health getaway. We had a fantastic time and well-needed break. The Radisson was very clean and near everything we wanted to see. We walked a lot, by choice, to see North Beach, Chinatown, etc. But the hotel was always close enough to stop by and take a break. We did not need our car for this trip...and the parking cost us $35./day. Next time we will forego the vehicle. One thing we absolutely enjoyed, and returned for the advanced tour was the SEGWAY tour....located near the cable car turnaround by the wharf. It was a highlight of our trip, and now my husband wants to buy one!! All the staff was great, and patient, getting us familiar with this &quot;toy&quot; so we could enjoy the 2 hr. tour of San Francisco. The advanced tour even took us down Lombard St. (the crookedest street)...what fun!!The staff at Radisson was great too....we will be back!!"
102,2142,"Sep 1 2008 	Great Location	We live only 25 minutes from SF and decided last minute to go one night Labor Day Weekend. We took our chances on Hotels.com to get a room w/ balcony. But no luck. Room was on the smallish side, but clean. The sleep number bed is truly a joke. My seven yr old found it hilarious to take it down to zero..too much like a toy. Still, if you have to share and sleep on the edge it's like having a 2x4 in your back. Yep, parking is $35 with a small parking lot that brought out the worst in folks when trying to get a stall. However, they let you check out and leave car until 7:00 at no extra charge. So we went to lunch and took a cable car ride before heading home. If you do this, you must check out and get a new key card to get let yourself out of the garage.  First time I've encountered an establishment who really heats the pool, and we had a nice swim. Pool area clean with tables, lounges and towels.Location to Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf is fantastic.So much fun just to ride down the elevator and be there!We found the staff to be accomodating with requests and the concierge was working his rear off to help everyone out.Though there are plenty of good hotels very close in distance to this, I would absolutely go back and just make sure I get the balcony room. That's one bonus most of the others can't offer."
103,2142,"Aug 31 2008 	A Great Family Spot	We stayed at the Radisson for four nights in August and were very pleased. The rooms were new and extrememly clean. Every bed is a select comfort bed. The pool was heated to what was probably 90 degrees and the location is the absolute best. The only negative, and it's a minor point, is that many of the parking spaces are quite a tight fit."
104,2142,"Aug 28 2008 	Very good location but needs refurbishment	The location of the Radisson is very good, right near the Wharf and to some good bars and restaurants.The hotel itself is in need of refurbishment but is clean which is the main thing. I would recommend paying the extra to have a balcony or view room as we ended up with a view of the car park. Some of the balconies overlook the bay and Alcatraz.Please note this hotel is not on a par with most of the Radissons I have stayed in - if you are expecting the normal Radisson standard you would be disappointed!The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but the IHOP next door is open 24 hours and there are loads of places to eat nearby.This is a good place if you just want somewhere to use as a base, but I would not say it is worth over $200.00 a night!"
105,2142,"Aug 27 2008 	5 days in San Francisco and Radisson	My daughter and i came down from Seattle and stayed at the Radisson for about a week. The B.A.R.T. train from the airport is the fastest and most affordable For the cost , and the location of the hotel was great. The people who work there were very friendly and proffesional.Alot of people have mentioned the IHOP nearby as a good place to eat,i disagree.The food was really greasy, the tables were not clean,the prices were too high. If you do eat there,get water and nothing else to drink.My daughters milk was over $3.00!There is a SAFEWAY a couple of blocks away, it is really small but you can still get some things affordable. Buy a good map which shows all the bus routes and stops, it wont take long to figure out and use the buses to get around. You can get to the Golden Gate Bridge,etc. The Haight/Ashbury district was a huge disappointment. The area was very dirty,rundown,and crime ridden. Alot of homeless and panhandlers. You should check out Colt tower, pretty neat. China town was exciting if you like store after store of cheap plastic crap no one wants. The wharf was cool and homeless were few. The Ripley was fun.Alcatraz was interesting, wear good arch shoes, alot of walking up and down hills. Overall it was a good trip, but then there is &quot;no place like home&quot;."
106,2142,"Aug 25 2008 	Not up to Radission standards	Advertised as the only hotel on the wharf, which we fell for, but when you get there you realise that what they mean, is it is the only hotel with an entrance onto the wharf, and that there are loads of others to choses from, so do not be mislead by this. Opposite the front entrance is a large sheraton, holiday inn and others. Having previously stayed in 5 star radission in berlin, we were somewhat dissapointed by this hotel. Although our overall experience was fine, there are some shortcomings to point out. We had a 4 berth room, with 2 teenage kids. The room we were allocated was pretty small for 4 of us. The air conditioning unit inthe room was large, old and noisy. The decor could do with a face lift, and the furniture in the room very large and old fashion. The beds however were these new ones where you can adjust the level of firmness of the matress and were excellent. The bathroom was fine, and housekeeping was good. As far as the facilities were concern don't have too high an expectation. There is no bar, no lounge,unless you include seating for 6 people in reception, no food, however there is a breakfast cart open inthe morning if you want to pay over inflated prices for pastries etc. the fitness room is a small room with a couple of pieces of equipment in. Cant comment on the pool as we did not use it. A fantastic breakfast for reasonable money can be found at the ihop restaurant next door to the hotel. We found the consierge service to be excellent, and other staff friendly and helpful.Overall we would say that this was a good hotel for the money in a great location, just do not expect it to be your typical Radisson."
107,2142,"Aug 21 2008 	Ticks the average box	First off, location excellent and San Francisco a wonderful place to visit. The Radisson was well located for Fishermans Wharf, access to the trams and local facilities such as cycle hire. As a tourist base it was excellent. As a hotel it served its purpose.Onto the hotel.Staff were ok and concierge helpful although we couldn't help but think that some of the recommendations were slightly skewed. A very pleasant breakfast location was suggested to the rear and right of the hotel about half a mile distant. $90 later for a family of 5 raised an eyebrow, only to find that if we had turned left and travelled 20 yards we could have found better food at two thirds the cost.Room walls were paper thin and we had to call security to ask them to speak to our partying next door neighbours. We may as well have invited them into our room for all of the sound insulation offered.Would we visit SF again? Absolutely!Would we stay at the Radisson Fishermans Wharf? Nah!"
108,2142,"Aug 9 2008 	Loved location but small room	Stayed 4 nights ending tour of California with partner and 18 y/o and 15 y/o children. This was the last stop for us and although the location of this hotel is great for Fishermans Wharf, we found the room to be the smallest we encountered on the tour.Considering the amount we paid for this hotel compared with others on this trip, we expected more in terms of room size. There was also a wait every time for the lifts.If what you are looking for is a convenient location and somewhere to lay your head then this accomodation is more than adequate but make sure you use the &quot;Privacy&quot; card in your door - housekeeping seem to start extremely early.We were lucky in that our room faced onto the parking area so we were never really disturbed by the early morning street cleaning but we also found the beds to be rather uncomfortable even with the sleep number system (we tried every combination from 25 to 100 without finding one to suit).Overall we were happy with the location of this hotel but would have preffered something a little larger and somewhere with a guest laundry which we missed."
109,2142,"Aug 6 2008	perfect location	I booked our rooms on the hotel website and only payed $192 a night. The cab ride from SFO was about 15 minutes and cost about $45. The Radisson is situated perfectly between Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39. The staff was excellent and the room was clean and roomy. I would highly recommend this hotel for families with children, or older couples. If my wife and I had been solo, we might have stayed somewhere more romantic."
110,2142,"Jul 29 2008 	Great location!	Hotel was in a great location! Very close walking distance to all tourist attractions in the Wharf. Rooms are a little small but I have heard that this is the case with all hotels in that area. And we really were only in the room to sleep anyways. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I was not a fan of the Sleep Number beds; I don't know what all the fuss was about. Bed was either too hard, or if we made it soft, then I could feel every time my husband would roll or shift during the night.Don' park a car if you don't have to, parking is $40/night at most area hotels, including the Radisson. The hotel also has a computer in the lobby which you can use to access the internet or print something out. Internet price was 50 cents per minute, with a minimum use of $5.00. Printing was $2.00 per page.The Wharf is very touristy, lots of souvenier shops that sell the same junk, but oh well. It was nice to be within walking distance of lots of stuff since we didn't have a car. Also, I would highly recommend using the local buses for transportation. It's $1.50 per ride and they go anywhere in town that you'll need. You can also get a 3 day pass for $18 that allows unlimited bus rides."
111,2142,"Jul 21 2008 	should be better for the money and location	They do have a great location, but the rooms are very small and the parking is terrible and high...The front desk is very little help and the rooms are to expensive for what you get...the elevators are a nightmare....I probably will not stay here again...No amout of complaining helped..."
112,2142,"Jul 18 2008	Great location but very noisy room	We are a family of four (2 boys agen 9 and 11) who were touring California this summer - and we stayed 3 nights at the Radisson Hotel at Fisherman's Wharf i San Francisco. The location is super - just across from Pier 39 and walking distance to Alcatraz pier, tram and many other sights. We did not book in advance and must say we had a very small and quite worn-down room facing the street. From 6 am in the morning the was a lot of noise from delivery trucks reversing outside so do get a room facing the court. We enjoyed our stay - the pool was also OK - the kids liked it though the air temperature was cool. But the hotel could do with new windows for instance ..."
113,2142,"Jul 17 2008 	problems at the Radisson	Stopped at the hotel for 5 nights &amp; was dissappointed. The lobby was old &amp; tired which is an indication of the style of the rest of the hotel. We were allocated a room with a king size bed for three adults, they changed it after the first night but this is a problem at the hotel because 10 other rooms had asked to be changed because of the same bed problem. My sons new trainers were stolen on the room change &amp; after asking three times no one seemed bothered about the issue, i have since complained to Radisson direct on the satisfaction survey &amp; are awaiting a reply. The air conditioniong unit on the next room was old &amp; very noisy &amp; kept me awake for two nights, complained after the first night but took two days to repair.Great to see the bridge, trams, Alcatraz , Union square etc but 5 days was too long for us, would have preferred more time in Carmel etc, Sausalito accros the bay was great, the bike ride over the bridge fantastic but be aware of the weather, you can by a cheap fleece but don't go expecting sun bathing. oh , car parking charged at $37 dollars a day, two blocks down at $20."
114,2142,"Jul 4 2008 	Mediocre hotel with OK location	I was there may of 2008, stayed 5 nights. This hotel is in an aging building begging for some renovation. I was really surprised to see the run-down and dirty reception-area furniture. Staff was friendly and polite. The rooms are just about OK, I had a regular double-bed room. No place for much else than that large (and comfy) bed. There's an A/C, model 1973 (not that you're that likely to need it but still..) Bathroom old but OK. Clean enough (which can't be said about the thick carpet in the room elsewhere).As mentioned earlier, the windows are very thin, and so the noise insulation terrible. I stayed at first in a room facing Beach street, with its bus and tram traffic all day and night. Couldn't sleep at all. Luckily, by day 2 the staff was able to relocate me to the other side, facing the parking-lot. (None of the rooms had a view of any interest).Oh, I read somebody mentioned the lack of internet connections. I'd brought my own laptop, and there's a free wireless at the grounds, so no problem!We had ordered breakfast, which basically means you get a ticket to exchange for food at the neighbour joint (kind of a fast-food / &quot;American comfort food&quot;- place). No heart-friendly food, that means, and 5 days of that food was enough for me. Compared to price and especially its altogether rundown character I would not recommend this place. It's in a need of renovation!"
115,2142,"Jun 22 2008 	cool in sanfrancisco/ radisson	2 nights at the radisson hotel on fishermans wharf in san francisco, i found the location of this hotel to be exaxtly what i wanted, right on the front of fishemans wharf, pier 39 and walking distance to other parts of the city , cable cars , trams etc.room had 2 double beds, shower/bathroom , all were clean and bed linen excellent ,, coffee and tea provided.only one table lamp faulty(faulty switch) all others worked so no issue.view from room, did not strike lucky as room faced on to car park, far left was pier 39 and to far left was the start of the tower blocks, with the spire tower block in view.the only downer at the hotel was the road cleaning machines arriving at 0430hours and windows only being single glazed the noise came in, they only do 2 sweeps of the road so you should be able to get back to sleep.the hotel has a &quot;back&quot; entrance directly from fishermans wharf, ideal for those unable to walk/stagger to the front lobby.the lobby is sizeable with a swimming pool to the rear, did not use pool or look to eat in hotel so i can not review those parts.when i head back to san francisco i would have no hesitation to stay in the hotel, i have no doubt there are better hotels but this one was fine for me."
116,2142,"Jun 21 2008	Fabulous Location!	We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a tour.The location of this hotel is absolutely SUPREME - right there opposite Pier 39 and ON Fisherman's Wharf (back door access)Our room was large and well appointed with remote controlled bed firmers!! (No, we couldn't be bothered to use them!)Lovely bathroom and lots and lots of lovely white fluffy towels and nice little toiletries too.The only thing was that there were strange noises in the room. I unplugged the fridge at 3am as its gurgling was like a water torture.Then there were other strange noises - most odd!We were very glad we stayed there because of the location - it's a shame there was no breakfast ( we are too old and set in our ways to stand up eating from a cart in the foyer!) but we had a seafood roll for breakfast on our last day and it was fantastic.We ate at Fog Harbour on Pier 39 on one night and at Bubba Gump on the Pier the other night (that's quite a chaotic experience for us oldies but the food was lovely!)The crookedest street is within walking distance (those hills do cause the legs to ache!) and everything is close to hand at this hotel.One word of caution - the internet service is a rip-off. I swiped my credit card and waited TEN MINUTES for IE to load :-("
117,2142,"Jun 17 2008 	Great location Radisson	I stayed here for 5 nights with my boyfriend in 2006. it was a fantastic option for us on this holiday as it had a great location, very close to Pier 39 and overlooking Alcatraz. The rooms were lovely and spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and the pool was very clean and nice with complimentary loungers. Loads of tours leave from Fisherman's Wharf, we'd recommend the day trip to Muir Woods and the Bay Cruise which goes under the golden gate and around Alcatraz. We booked our tickets for Alcatraz in advance and this was great as we skipped all the queues the morning of our trip! This hotel is great for tourists and we'd definately stay here again if we return to San fran!"
118,2142,"Jun 15 2008 	Great hotel for a short break.	This hotel is in the most amazing location for seeing the sights at Fishermans Wharf. We had a smallish room but it had all we required and was clean and comfortable. We could see the bay and watch the boats sailing between the piers. There is no dining room, but an adequately stocked cart in the main foyer sells coffee, croissants, fruit, friut juice etc for breakfast. However there are many excellent restaurants merely a stones throw from both the front and rear entrances of the hotel. Would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to friends."
119,2142,"Jun 6 2008 	Good value for money	This hotel is in a perfect location for just about all the tourist sights. It is near to many restaurants and very easy to get to areas that are not within walking distance, either by taxi or cable car. We stayed here for 4 days and crammed as much sight seeing as possible. The hotel itself was clean and respectable. Not entirely the usual Radisson standard, but acceptable. Staff were extremley courteous and very helpful. We did not use the pool as it was September and it was far too chilly for a dip, but it did look clean and well kept."
120,2142,May 30 2008 	Good value for money	Hotel is a fair value for money. It is located in the most touristy bit of SF but that's what we wanted. Room was a normal size for 2 double beds. We had a balcony facing the courtyard and it was fairly quiet. Beds were very comfortable with variable controlled stiffness. Both room and bathroom were clean even though the latter had some mould on the ceiling.There's no restaurant in the hotel but there are plenty at its door step. An IHOP is actually in the same building. The outside swimming pool is heated which is quite welcome with the constant breeze. The staff were friendly &amp; helpful from front desk to room service. So we did have an enjoyable stay and would recommend it to others on a tourist trip to SF.
121,2142,"May 29 2008 	Couldn't be a Radisson could it?	This hotel is pretty disappointing for a Radisson. There is no kitchen, so if you want room service, you need to call for a delivery. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. We couldn't have both our suitcases open and walk around the bed. The bed, there's a story. It is one of these adjustable mattresses. It felt like you were sleeping on an air bag with very little support and every time you adjusted it, a noisy compressor started up.Location is fantastic. There are lots of places nearby to eat &amp; shop, the piers are close, as well as heaps of public transport nearby, including the famous cable cars.Given that we have seen how many different hotels there are in the area, we would probably stay somewhere else next time."
122,2142,"May 28 2008 	Location Good - OK hotel	I stayed at Radisson firshermans wharf on a work trip last year and found it to be ok. The location is fantastic if you want to be right in the heart of Fisherman's wharf and walking distance to Pier 39, shops etc.The actual hotel itself is a little on the old side for the price you are paying. The rooms are quite small though have a comfy bed and nice bathroom.Overall I would say this is a good 3.5 star hotel in a great location - it is a little overpriced for what you are getting though. I suppose you are in fact paying for the location"
123,2142,"May 24 2008 	Great location....	Can't really fault this hotel, the location is great, near all amenities. Loved the bed...You can adjust the pressure!...Great!."
124,2142,"May 23 2008	location location location	we are just back from a great stay at the Radisson, you can not beat the location, it is a 5 minute walk from pier 39 and outside the hotel you can get the F train trolly down town for $1.50 and with that ticket you can travel on any train trolly for that day. For a 10 minute walk you will be in Mama's the best breakfast in San Francisco but be there at 7.45am it opens at 8.00am or be prepared to queue. The room we had in the hotel was small but spotless clean with a very big comfortable bed. One tip I would have when booking the hotel is to ask not to be put at the front of the hotel as it can be noisey from the traffic and buses."
125,2142,"May 10 2008 	Great hotel	Ideal location to explore San Fran. Ideally positioned to let you see and do all there is to do at the Wharf (Alcatraz etc) or to let you board an open topbus and explore a bit further. We went to Haight Ashbury and Berkeley and loved them but it was nice to come back and stay at the Wharf at night time. When we first arrived we thought it might be quite noisy at night because of where it is located BUT this was not the case. Excellent staff, great breakfasts. Perfect choice for San Fran."
126,2142,"May 6 2008 	terrible service stay away!	we booked this hotel with our travel agent before we left and i had a receipt to prove that we had paid the full amount for our 4 night stay. when we arrived at the hotel the rude man behind the desk told us that we had no booking and that we would not be receiving a room. when i produced the receipt he tried to call the company in which we had booked it with but could not contact them. after waiting in the lobby with our suitcases for half an hour he informed me that i should count myself lucky and that he had found us a room. he took the receipt from me and said he would chase up the payment with the company back in australia considering we had already paid. they took a swipe of my credit card as i noticed this is pretty much mandatory in most hotels in the us. when we went to the room, we were a bit suprised at how small it was considering what we had paid for it. and the room from the elevators was at least 200 metres. we did no enjoy staying at this hotel at all and were very glad to leave especially after the rude service that we received. when we got back to australia, i was suprised to find that the hotel had charged me for our stay to my credit card. it took me a further 3 months to get this money refuned and in the end i had to ring my bank to chase this money up. i would not recommend this hotel."
127,2142,"May 5 2008 	Good Hotel Great Location	The Radisson at Fisherman's Wharf is an older hotel that has been upgraded at some time in the past. In some spots this is jarringly obvious, like the old bathtub against the new tile in the bath room, and old window frames against the new curtains.The room was clean and fresh and housekeeping did a good job each day. The bed was much better than you normally find in a three star hotel, comfortable and reasonably new with very good pillows, high quality sheets and comforter.The hotel staff were helpful and the location was great, right in the middle of the tourist trap that is Fisherman's wharf.The only negatives were the outrageous cost of parking ~$35/per night and the old windows in the room which didn't stop the noise from outside.There is no restaurant in the hotel, but for breakfast just across the road is Boudins with fabulous fresh bread and pastries."
128,2142,"May 5 2008 	hotel okay	We had hotwire rate of $76 king for 2 for a night on the weekend. It was okay for this price. I would have been upset if we had paid $200 a night off of hotels website. Hotel is older hotel. Lots of tour groups were there when we stayed at hotel. Elevator -2. I liked hotel location because it was close to bus- 9 and 39, f line streetcar, and cablecar. We asked for refrig but it was never brought to us. Sleep number bed was okay. Room was on third floor so did not hear much noise except f street car's bells. Hotel has no restaurant. Ihop nest door but I didn't eat there. walked a couple of blocks to Pat's Cafe and to north beach. Did eat at Johnny rockets and it seemed average.Concierge printed out boarding passes for us."
129,2142,"Apr 30 2008 	Loved this hotel	When planning this too brief stay in San Francisco I couldnt decide if Union Square or the Fisherman's Wharf area would be best.I am glad we decided on Fisherman's Wharf and especially glad we chose the Radisson Hotel.The front desk staff were very welcoming and polite. And at checkout thanked us for staying and said they hoped we enjoyed our stay and it wasnt just by rote.We didnt have a room with sleep number beds but the beds were very comfortable just the same with lovely bedding. Very well kept and clean.The windows opened!!!-a bonus for us- and we had a great view of the bridge(in the distance), bay and Alcatraz. Free room safe, coffee and tea.The hotel as mentioned by others does not have a restaurant for breakfast but it is literally next door to an IHOP and you can purchse a continental breakfast off a &quot;cart&quot; in the Lobby.There is a Johnny Rockets fast food type restaurant as well as an exit right to the piers behind the small pool area.Also there is an ATM machine just around the corner along with a 7 to 11 store.To the right as you exit the hotel.Great location walked everywhere we wanted to go and loved Fisherman's Wharf even though it was very crowded. We were tourists! and part of the crowd!"
130,2142,"Apr 22 2008 	Keep Looking	I wound up at this Radisson after first trying 40 other hotels which were booked solid due to the Olympic torch being in town. I should have kept looking to see what #42 was like. The Radisson is not a bad hotel, it just wasnt work $200+ per night. For the money you get a location some distance from downtown, one of those pretend fitness rooms, no meal service, no lobby, a small outdoor pool that opens at 9AM and row after row of indistinct rooms. The rooms are ok, could use some updating and cleaning. It is not a bad hotel but you can do better for the money."
131,2142,Apr 14 2008 	Nasty room great location...but would not stay here again	The location is great for San Fran but we avoided being in our room as much as possible. Here are the problems: 1. We did not have a remote for the TV. 2. The toilet backed up (then released an awful smell when it corrected itself). 3. The safe did not work. 4. There was left over trash under our beds from the previous guest. 5. There were dried up boogers on the side of our bed. 6. The bathroom door had been very poorly patched. 7. $35 per night for SELF parking. 8. No replenishing of soap or shampoo on the 2nd night.We stayed at another hotel in the area (same price range per night) 2 nights prior to this stay and had a very good experience so I was a bit disappointed with this place. I would recommend staying at a cheaper but nicer hotel just outside of town. It is not worth it to be this close when you can drive into town and park for the day cheaper than at this hotel.
132,2142,"Apr 14 2008 	Worked for us . . .	Stayed here for two nights (April 5&amp;6). Paid $70/night with Priceline. For the price we paid for the room, we were satisified. The room was a bit run down. And I too found a hair in the bathroom (on the handle of the faucet in the sink). Other than than, it was a pretty average hotel stay. Nothing awful, nothing fantastic.We had a bit of a view of the bay, but mostly a view of a parking lot/garage. But, with a Priceline room, I wasn't expecting much so I was surprised that I could see the bay at all.Checkin was easy and the gentleman that waited on us was very pleasant.The hotel is conveniently located, that was the big draw. Easy to get on the F-line or the Cable Cars to get down town. Didn't even need a taxi to get back to the airport. Took the advise of members on the TripAdvisor forums and took the F-line down to the Embarcadaro BART station and took BART to the airport (not too difficult and a lot cheaper than a taxi!) Nights were quite. Didn't care too much for the sleep number bed, but to each his own.All in all, considering the price we paid and the location of the hotel, we were very pleased."
133,2142,Apr 10 2008	Met my expectations	This was my last hotel stay before 20 months of hostels so I was very happy. The room and bathroom were clean (could have done with a longer and deeper bath but this is the case in most hotels). The staff were good and it is in an ideal location for tourist attractions.
134,2142,"Apr 9 2008	Good location and bed - terrible concierge	Comfortable bed in SF Fisherman's Wharf. That's about it.At the reception desk, one is friendly, professional, and cheerful. Another one is professional and friendly. The others are not. The concierge woman seems to be bored which is a pity when you are a concierge in a San Francisco hotel.Rooms are a bit old, but bed are new and very confortable. Bathroom is a bit old too, but clean. Relaxed atmosphere. Mixed clientele: old/young couples/singles/groups...Overall a good deal if you consider the hotel room prices in the area.Internet connection in the hall (2 pc available - fee) is indeed extremely slow. If you wanna go to Union Square, cable cars are an easy walk from the hotel. And staying in the Fisherman's Wharf area is much nicer and relaxing that staying in Union Square (read about my other experiences)."
135,2142,"Apr 8 2008 	Location Location Location	I just spent 3 nights at the Fisherman's Wharf Radison. I would say this hotel has the best location in the fisherman's wharf area. You can walk out the back entrance of the hotel and you are immediately on the strip that makes up the wharf area. The rooms were comfortable. The bed slept good and the pillows were comfortable with several styles in the mix to chose from. There is an IHOP next door, which is a great place to get breakfast. My family was satisfied. No complaints from me."
136,2142,"Apr 7 2008 	It's fine but the internet is appalling	If, for some strange reason, you find yourself checking in for business purposes, do think again: The internet in the hotel, although marketed as 'high speed' is absolutely nowhere near that. I was getting 10k/sec speeds. Ridiculous. If internet is a key requirement for your stay, I thoroughly recommend you try somewhere else. I ended up going to the Starbucks across the way to get internet. Not good when I'd specifically chosen the hotel for it's 'complimentary high speed wireless internet'."
137,2142,Apr 1 2008 	Very Accomodating	The staff was extremely nice and accomodating. Although when we arrived the hotel did not have a room available due to stay-overs - they went above and beyond to accomdate us and find alternate accomodations. They even went as far as paying for the cab fare.We came back the next day and found a clean room with nice but basic appointments. Again the staff was super. I am not a bg fan of the sleep number beds but still slept soundly with no disturbances.Location cannot be beat. Already recommended this to friends.
138,2142,"Mar 30 2008 	Great location poor service.	I'll start with the good - location was unbeatable. We had a rental car but didn't use it for the first day and a half of our 4 day stay because you can walk to so much around Fisherman's Wharf or take trolley/cable car to some sights.The concierge was friendly and very helpful.That's it for the good.When we checked in we were told that our adjoining room request was not going to be honored because someone extended their stay and, &quot;there's nothing I can do for you&quot;. That changed to &quot;i can move you tomorrow&quot; when I suggested that I would check back in the morning for an adjoining room or find another hotel. So we were in a total of four rooms while staying here - each room had hair in the tub (from the previous guest), and one had hair on the bathroom floor - even as a guy I think that's gross.The sleep number beds are awful, even if you want a soft bed, the ridge around the outside of the bed stays hard and with two people in the beds you need the outside of the bed!The rooms are beaten down - one of the first rooms we were in had a sink in the bathroom that was coming off the wall and the exhaust fan was broken in one of the other bathrooms. They were all small rooms...I know hotel rooms are small, but these seemed very small.The front desk service was poor - my kids independently nicknamed the woman who checked us in &quot;Happy Jack&quot;.There was enough here that even for the stellar location, I would not recommend this hotel or stay here when we go back to San Francisco. We paid $189 night for two rooms and I expected better for the price and the name."
139,2142,"Mar 29 2008 	Worst Service Ever	First of all, the parking charges are ridiculous. It is $35 per day PLUS tax. When we got to our room, I expected to be able to log on to their advertised free WiFi. Guess what? I was able to intermittently connect at a terrible 1 Mbps. Once a website came up, it almost immediately logged off. I went downstairs to get some help and they gave me some sort of &quot;booster&quot; pack for which they tried to charge me $250 for. The booster didn't work, even after spending an hour on the phone with tech support. The only thing this hotel has going for them is the location, directly on the bay, so everything was easily accessible. As for the service, though, it was terrible. Housekeeping came right at 8 a.m. and they were pushy about getting us out so that they could get in and get it done. The toilet stopped working and I had to make 2 engineering requests because the first time didn't get it fixed. The second time didn't either, but we were leaving the next morning, so it didn't matter to me. Overall, it was a terrible experience and I will not stay at another Radisson hotel again."
140,2142,"Mar 27 2008	Great Stay at Radisson Fishermans wharf	Of al the hotels in Fisherman's Wharf this has the best location to all of what is happining. Its close to both cable car locations, trolly for the Embarcedero and bus to the Coit Tower. The room we had was perfect. I must say we did not take the cheap rooms as we wanted to face to the water and see the bay and Alcatraz from our room. The room was a bit small but I am told all is the same in Fisherman's Wharf. The beds are perfect and have a control to change how hard or soft you want it to be. They provided lots of towels and all around everything was very clean. It was too cold for us to go swimming but we saw kids swimming and pool was very warm. The pool is very nice. The concierge was very helpful and reccommeneded that we use the van heading back to the airport and use a coupon from a specific book which enabled us to get the van back to SFO for $11 each. THis hotel gives you a good buy for the buck."
141,2142,"Mar 21 2008 	A good base for exploring SF	We got a good deal on this hotel from Skoosh.com. The location was good - touristy Fisherman's Wharf may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is safe, there are restaurants nearby and it provides easy access to elsewhere in the city with good public transport links right on the doorstep.Our stay came part-way through our trip, by which time we already had a rental car, and parking was $40/night, but that seems to be the norm for SF hotels. If you're coming direct from the airport and not planning any trips out of the city whilst staying there, you may as well hold off renting until you head off elsewhere.The room itself was comfortable and well-appointed - about what you would expect from a large chain. We had no complaints, and it was quiet giving us a good night's sleep for each of the nights that we stayed ready for exploring the city the following day! In fact, the only noise was people trying out the sleep number beds - where you can set the softness/stiffness of the mattress with a remote control... who wouldn't play with it ;-)Our only contact with staff was limited to check-in/-out, but on both occasions, they were polite and efficient."
142,2142,"Mar 19 2008 	Good overall nice staff good location	Pleasant stay at the Radisson Fisherman's Wharf. Pleasant and helpful front desk staff and concierge. Clean rooms with attentive housekeeping. No problems. Room on the small side with no view, but I can't complain given the rate (~115).My only complaint was the overpriced internet access/business center. It cost 50 cents/minute to use the computer for anything (including internet) and another 50 cents/page to print, and the connection was slow so it took quite some time just to check your email. Luckily there is an internet cafe right next door that is much cheaper - which the hotel staff told us about when we inquired.Would stay here again."
143,2142,"Mar 19 2008	Uber Euro Hotel/ Local B	This hotel is easily found from the airport. In fact whilst i cheated with the Sat Nav it is literally one long road followed by a right then a left and you're there - about 20 mins. It is in an excellent location, i cannot really imagine a better location in San Francisco to be honest. Parking is a jizz at $35 per night and is snidey little tiny spaces that a Smart Car would struggle to park in. I turn up in a Chrysler 300 and the following day had to climb through the passenger door! Rooms are ok, imagine throwing a B&amp;B into a bucket, add to that you're usual Radisson room, shake it about for ten minutes and throw it out. That is the room. In the room there was one bath towel. Thats it. Now the bed, it was a kind of ultra modern air bed that could be adjusted. In reality it was uncomfortable, i know it sounds a bit dodgy but believe me, lay down on a balloon and tell me its comfy - Its not is it. No and neither are the beds. Wireless was fast and free, breakfast is expensive downstairs at the 24hr Ihop. Check out was again a breeze. In conclusion the hotel is average, but the location and friendly staff sway it for me and i would certainly stay there aif i was in SFO. Well, i say that, but im writing this from the Grand Sierra in Reno and the Radisson isn't a scrap on this place : )"
144,2142,"Mar 11 2008 	Worked for us!	Very reasonable hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I went with a friend and we chose this hotel primarily because we could request a smoking room, and as seasoned smokers were very glad we did (even though the rude woman on reception claimed we'd have to share a kingsize bed if we wanted a smoking room then gave us two double beds when I threatened to throw a minor wobbly). Few things to note:1. The hotel is indeed quite shabby but certainly not as bad as some of the various website photos I viewed before going appear. Our room was perfectly fine, shower great, and a good view of Alcatraz over the top of the various eateries' neon lights.2. You do not eat in or ask for cabs from this hotel. It's like a travelodge - there's places to eat everywhere so just step out (OK just go to Johnny Rockets it ROCKS) and the staff are NOT helpful (either can't or won't order a taxi depending on mood/day of week) so give yourself ample time to stand on a street waiting for one of the 5 taxis the city has to offer.3. Fisherman's Wharf is fiercely cheesy. Perfect for the full on tourist experience - Pier 39 is fantastic post several Grey Goose n cokes. However, the bigger restaurants are overpriced and the food's not great (I say don't bother with Scoma's or Franciscan - go to boudin for a great Clam Chowder!) If you're looking to hang out in stylish bars n restaurants every evening you'll be spending a lot of time in taxis (or rather, more annoyingly, looking for them) getting to the Union Square side of town.4. San Francisco is so fabulous that you won't want to sit in the hotel. Go to Alcatraz, do the Wine Country Shuttle Tour of Napa Valley, go see a basketball game in Oakland. Shop, shop, shop. And make sure you get your burger, fries n shake at Johnny Rockets."
145,2142,"Mar 9 2008 	Nice rooms but bad service	The hotel was fairly average and the rooms were okay and quite suprising from my expectations, apart from the bust air con. Try and get a room facing fishermans wharf as they are bigger and you can see such attractions as the golden gate bridge and alcatraz. There is no sit down breakfast here but you can buy pastries and hot drinks downstairs and there is a IHOP and a Walgreens on the same street so it's not far to go. However the service is not great. If you want tickets to the local attractions, the concierge is only reliable for the alcatraz tour as the man at the concierege charged us $120 for $15 tickets to go to a baseball match. The touts in the parking lot of the stadium were even charging $20 for better tickets! In my opinion try the box office at the attraction before going to the concierge."
146,2142,"Feb 29 2008 	Good especially for the price	This hotel was right at Fisherman's Wharf which was ideal for us with the children and for our trip to Alcatraz.Our room was comfortable and had a great view over to Alcatraz.The staff were not overly friendly though and the hotel could have been a bit cleaner too.For the price though I'd say it was a very good deal, although remember you will need to pay quite a bit for parking too."
147,2142,"Feb 19 2008	Good Option for the Price	This hotel is a good option if you're able to get a good deal. We ended up getting a Standard King room at $89 a night through Hotwire which was unbeatable considering the location. It's located right in Fisherman's Wharf, across from Pier 39. There is access to a huge variety of restaurants and attractions. The F line street car picks up right in front of the hotel and can take you to several other areas including Pier 33 which is the location to buy tickets or board the on-site Alcatraz tour (it's the only tour which takes you ON alcatraz, not just around it). The hotel itself was outdated, but I would still consider it a 3 star considering the ammentities, options and location. All staff was helpful and considerate. Overall, we were happy with the hotel considering the great price! If we would have paid more, I might have been a bit disappointed."
148,2142,Feb 18 2008 	Clean Standard issue Hotel	All has been said before - I would say this is a clean convienient place for a couple of nightsGood+ Really Clean modern linen+ Really excellent location with entrance onto the strip+ Clean rooms+ Not a bad pool area+ 70 a night with ebookers.comOK~ Room decor a bit drab~ Strange adjustable bed firmnessNot so good ( but the room was cheap..)- No views form the cheap rooms- Outside rooms a tad noisy- Coffee Maker + fridge onlyI would defiantly stay here again if I wanted a few days on the Wharf* $11 a day cable car /tram /muni daily pass excellent* Easy walk to North Beach Restaurants - Mona Lisa etc* lots of public transport to Union Sq and Market areas* 7/11 store nearby
149,2142,"Feb 12 2008 	Better than reviews would suggest	Got a really good deal on the hotel, a little nervous after reading the other reviews but I was impressed (I guess my expectations were low). The hotel is old but well kept, a great base for the Wharf. Parking is expensive, but you dont need a car, you can walk or use the MUNIOnly negative is the lack of on site restaurant, but food is abundant. We bought breakfast stuff at the Safeway 1 block away.If you go downtown avoid the civic centre, unless you are fond of vagrants!!!"
150,2142,"Feb 7 2008 	Perfect	Radisson Hotel Fisherman's Wharf is a wonderful hotel. Nice, spatious rooms. Spotless. So quiet you could think you're in the middle of a desert. The bathroom was clean and modern. The location is perfect if you're interested in strolling by the piers. If you intend to explore the Union Square district you could have a quite short walk in a pleasent neighbourhood. Check the special walking route in the tourist map from the hotel. ."
151,2142,"Jan 30 2008 	Great little hotel	You can't go wrong staying here. Location, Location Location. You are just 2 minutes to Fisherman;s Wharf Pier 39. The hotel itself does not have a resturant but there are at least 10 in the 4 surrounding blocks that the hotel is located on. There is an IHOP that is 24 hours. The cable cars are 2 blocks away and there was a electric trolly that runs into the downtown area and back , across the street. You need no car if you want to get around the city and there are at least 5 bus routes around the corner to get you to various locations. The room itself was a little smaller than average, but you are not in the room often anyway. The bathroom was clean and was replenished everyday with towels ,soap etc. The sleep # bed was a plus and overall the hotel is quiet as this is not a hotel you would take kids to. A grocery store and a Walgreens is across the street also. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. There is so much to do around the neighborhood and it's all right there at their doorstep"
152,2142,"Jan 30 2008 	After 2 months of stay!!	Ok, so I wrote my first review on this hotel back in November after a few days of being there. Scroll down to see :)And I've been staying there for over 2 months now if that tells you anything! Staff has been really great, ask for Lisa, really helpful and nice...Everything has been great since. Feel like I live there now...I've also witnessed a few changes since November. They recently installed new carpets which look much better, and the pool is now up and running. Haven't tried it out yet, but I've seen people in there on cold nights and steam coming up from it, so it must be warm...As I said before, the location is PERFECT if you are visiting, you will not get bored at all!Looking forward to the next month :)"
153,2142,"Jan 7 2008 	Great base for San Francisco	As other reviewers have said - you get exactly what should expect from a Radisson at this price at this type of location.We arrived after midnight and the staff were really helpful - actually figuring that we might be tired after 15 hours travelling and getting a security guard to help us with bags to our room.Neat, tidy, reasonably clean. Lots of good places to eat at any time of the day within two blocksEasy parking but expensive - if you have a car and are not planning to use it - consider putting down past Pier 33 where it is one third of the price."
154,2142,"Jan 7 2008 	Great Location	Very happy with Radisson, they let us check in early and the room was very acceptable for the price we paid considering some of the other hotels in the area. Very close to Fishermans Wharf-across the road. Not much here if you are here for the night life but we were not here for that. The IHOP 30 seconds down the street is open 24hrs and does fantastic food at very low cost."
155,2142,"Dec 24 2007 	Clean Comfortable and Convenient!	I stayed at the Radisson in mid-December for 3 nights. I was very happy with my choice and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone going to San Francisco. First, the location is excellent! It is the closest hotel to the wharf and Pier 39. If you go out the back way, it puts you right in the heart of the wharf/pier area. Of course, there are many restaurants and shops to choose from all along the wharf/pier area. I found the area very safe to walk in, including later at night. There were always people out walking around enjoying the restaurants etc. If you go out the front by the lobby, you are on Beach St. There are two trolley stops in front of the hotel, one to the right and one to the left. It makes it very easy to head into downtown/union square and is only $1.50 each way. On the way back in from downtown, you are also dropped off right in back of the hotel, couldnt be any easier. I would not recommend getting a car, as it is not needed and San Fran has great public transportation. Also around the hotel are a Safeway and Walgreens, which makes it convenient to get snacks etc and save a little money. There is also other national shops close by, and attached to the hotel building is an IHOP, Johnny Rockets and a Subway. The hotel its self is a 4 story U shaped building with a wing in the middle. The lobby is very small but functional. I arrived at about 7pm and there was one person ahead of me checking in. I did use there online check in option, which is supposed to save you time etc, however, at check in, I still had to sign and present my credit card. According to the website, checking in online is supposed to save you from doing anything except presenting your ID to get your keys. Oh well, check in only took about 3 minutes. I had requested a king size bed non smoking online and received one on the 4th floor of the hotel. There are two main elevators in the lobby, with a few others scattered around the building. The hallways did have a unique smell I suppose, but nothing too bad. The hallways sort of reminded me of an old cruise liner. The room itself was perfect for one person (for a couple it would be fine as well). The room was probably about 300 sq ft at most, however, it was functional and clean. The bed was WONDERFUL!! They all have the sleep number beds, with down comforters and down pillows. You can set the bed to whatever number suits you. There was also a small desk and an armoire with a TV and storage. The air/heating unit was a little loud, but it worked perfectly. You can also open the windows to let in the fresh air. The bathroom entrance was right next to the bed, which was a little odd, but again, for one person, it was fine. The bathroom was of good size though (bigger than the one I had at the Crowne Plaza union square). It had ample space to move around and place your things. The water pressure was fine as well as the temperature. The room was cleaned everyday while I was out sightseeing and they did a great job. I did manage to see the rooms with two double beds and they seemed a little bigger, so space didnt seem like a problem in those rooms. Overall, I loved coziness of the room and the bed made it well worth it. I would definitely stay there again next time I travel to San Francisco. Everyone I came into contact that worked at the hotel was friendly and would always greet me. The location is perfect for travelers visiting the city. I also had a good view of one of the hill areas, the wharf, and even a view of Alcatraz and the water. I couldnt really ask for more. The other hotels in the area are close by, but for the price, the Radisson was the best option. It is definitely a solid 3 star hotel."
156,2142,"Dec 19 2007 	In Need of a Major Renovation	We stayed at the Radisson Fishermans Wharf from Tuesday December 11th to Friday December 14th.The location of this hotel is superior. The back of the property actually has a walkway out into the Wharf area. It is walking distance to many good restaurants and the ferry to Alcatraz.Unfortunately the hotel is in desperate need of a major renovation, The decor is very 70's and run down. The pool was empty and the concrete was cracked around it. The Carpets were stained and there was some mold around the bath tub.We walked the Wharf area and checked out some of the other properties. The Sheraton right across the street was nice and the Marriott was also very nice. We priced them out too when we were choosing where to stay and regret not selecting one of them.On our first night, we were given a room which faces Beach Street. Not good, very loud and noisy. The room was very small and stuffy. I complained the next morning and they moved us across the hall. That room faced the courtyard and was much quieter and more spacious,Some other tips. Take the night tour of Alcatraz. It is limited to only 300 people. That may seem like a lot, but during the day there can be over 1,000 people inside at any given time.We tried a restaurant called the Stinking Rose. If you like garlic, this is the place! I can not remember the name of the street it is on, but if you google it they have a web site.All in all, we loved San Fran. It is a very nice and clean city.We will definately be back, but not at the Radisson FW."
157,2142,"Nov 23 2007 	As long as you don't care about customer service	Positives: Location, Location, Location, clean rooms, and a helpful night security guard.Negatives: If you are looking to be treated with any respect, a helpful staff, or parties at 3:00 a.m. to be stopped, you should not go to this hotel. With the exception of one night security guard, the staff was rude, nasty, and unhelpful. Because of the location to the wharf, tours, cable cars and the City, they dont care if you come back or not and treat you as such. Literally, bus loads were there. It was obvious, because of the location; they dont need your business and could care less if you come back.As long as your expectations about customer service are low, the location more than makes up for how horribly you will be treated."
158,2142,"Nov 16 2007 	great hotel fantastic location	I was staying at Room 2005 for two nights as part of a three week road trip. US$42 cab ride away from SFO airport. Arrived Sunday eveing, very efficent check-in. no delays. Business Centre 50 cents p/min. Great room, including coffee maker. The hotel is right on Fisherman's Wharf. One minute walk to Pier 39, for great food and shops. I-Hoop and Jonny Rocket's on premises. Short walk to car rental downtown, which we picked up Avis vehicle. Good tour -- if you can't get on the Alcatraz island -- 'Blue &amp; Gold' ferry trip under Golden Gate bridge and around Alcatraz Island with great narrative. Free USA Today. Fully recommend hotel."
159,2142,"Nov 13 2007 	Good location - unimpressive	The hotel is situated right next to Fisherman's wharf, which itself is Ok for most of central San Francisco.The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the facilites Ok - but having been refurbished a few years back it's time for another one. Whilst the rooms were Ok the general decor was a bit dowdy and the corridors dull and slightly depressing. For the price I expected more.Wouldn't go overboard about the negatives and I'd stay there again - but I would want to explore other options (and there are a lot of them) first."
160,2142,"Nov 11 2007 	Best location and a good hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 9 nights (avg $220/nt pre tax).1. BEST LOCATION:a). This simply is the best located hotel in Fishermans Wharf area, comparing to a long list of other hotels I looked up. I read many reviews stating so and once arrived, I 100% agree. It is the only hotel that is 'bay-front' in this area, thus giving it a number of rooms that had a full bay view with balconies (double the price too). About 1/3 of the rooms have a Very Roomy balcony (10'x5'?), other than those facing the bay, the majority overlook the courtyard and has a partial bay view. The hotel is a U-shape 4-story building, with the U's openning end facing the bay. There is a back door that leads you right onto Jefferson St which is the bay front street lined with shops and restaurants.b). The hotel is within easy walking distance to Pier 39 (out the back door and cross the street diagonally and you are there, and many other area attractions. On a quiet night, you can hear the Sea Lions 'talking' to each other in the distance.c). You are so close to the pier actions you can hear the bands on the weekend, but once the door is closed, no noise bothered us - very good window/door that blocked out noise.d). There is a 24hr IHOP downstairs, a Safeway and Walgreens one block away, and many other dinning and shopping options.There are plenty of public transportation routes go through here so you really don't need a car (I only rented a car for two days to go to the wine country). Buy a MUNI pass and route map and you'll get everywhere easily.2. Older Hotel Recently Face-lifted, Smaller Rooms:a). The hotel room is fairly small (not tiny, as I've stayed in tiny rooms at downtown Manhatan). Our 2DD room only had one-person-wide walk ways around the room, after putting in two Sleep-Number beds, a TV/Closet unit, and a full size desk and office chair. The bathroom in our room is oddly located with the opening right at the side of one of the beds, not sure if they are all like this. I wished they had sacrificed the huge balcony a bit to make the room bigger. BE WARE - closet space is very limited. It is combined with the TV cabnit (two slim openings on both sides of the TV cabnit and drawers). No wall units or walk-in closet. Apparently the hotel just got a face lift but you can still see the 'oldness' of it from the walls, hallways and elevators. the Sleep Number beds are great and the down comforter and pillows are wonderful.b). Free wireless internet in all rooms and FREE printing service (uses an online service that prints out to the front desk).c). There is a concierge in the lobby, and a computer dedicated to checking-in and printing out boarding passes from all airlines.d). There is a small gym and an outdoor heated pool in the courtyard. There is a Jonny Rockets on premise.e). There is a parking deck with good number of parking spaces, but pricy ($30/nt). Though parking in the area is expensive anyways (street parking has 1-hr limit unless you have some sort of residence pass). There is a garage next block over offers $14/nt parking, but has a hight limit that looked pretty low to fit a SUV through.3. Excellent Service:a). I checked in at night, checked out in the morning, called guest service a few times and asked help from the lobby staff a few times, and I made a mistake in returning the parking pass late...all these occasions the staff was very efficient and friendly, and solved my issue or request right away. I was very satisfied with the service from everyone I encountered.LIKES:LOCATION, amenities around the hotel, staff services, big balcony, heated pool, free wireless internetDISLIKES:Smaller 2DD rooms, older hotel, very limited closet space, no business center, expensive parking (aren't all big cities like this?)RECOMMENDED FOR:Vacation couples all ages, families, singles/friends groupNOT RECOMMENDED FOR:Business travelersAll in all, this is a great hotel for its location and good enough price, but is older and has smaller rooms."
161,2142,"Oct 25 2007 	Excellent Location	You could not ask for a better location. You walk out the back door and you are right on the Warf! If you are looking to stay near the Warf this is the place. The Hotel itself is nice. Nothing super spectacular, but a nice Radisson. They are in the process of changing their beds to the sleep number beds but not all are switched over yet. There are only 4 floors but you get an excellent view of the bay, I could see Alcatraz from my room. Some rooms had balconies, mine did not, but very nice large windows to take in the view. They also have a nice pool and courtyard area"
162,2142,"Oct 18 2007	Great location very nice room great staff	We moved to this hotel from another which was dreadful. We booked it that morning on Expedia, packed up and went to the hotel. It was only 11am but they checked us in immediately. We didn't go for a room with a view as we didn't want to pay the extra price. The room's proximity to the road was a bit noisy in the morning but we didn't mind that much.The room was very comfortable and the bed was a delight. It was nice to be able to do dial your side of the bed for how soft or hard you wanted it. I didn't want to get out the next morning. The room offered free strong connection wireless internet. The location is brilliant. Easy walk to all areas around Pier 39 and to the many restaurants."
163,2142,"Oct 18 2007	Nothing special - OVERPRICED!	We stayed 3 nights in San Francisco. The location of the hotel is very good, walking distance to the Fisherman's Wharf even if probably now i would choose another suburb...after 10pm it's complitely dead....definetly better North Beach.The hotel was clean but our room was at the parking level so no way to have light directly from outside since everybody in the parking can look at you.Breakfast is not present...there is a free convenson with HOPI just outside the hotel.The staff at the reception is probably the worst we've found in our live...really unpolite and not nice.There are some other hotels close to that in that area....we strictly recomended those one (probably better, for sure cheaper!)"
164,2142,"Oct 14 2007 	Location Location Location	I have read most of the reviews for this hotel and I will say the IHOP was deplorable. That said it is not a reflection of the hotel.We were there during fleet week so the hotel was very full. I asked off handed if there were any bay views and the woman said there was ONE and it was in a smoking room. After hesitating because we didn't want a stinky room, one of the reception workers took us up to the room to let us preview it. That was above and beyond anything I expected a hotel to do.We were able to keep the windows open and enjoyed the view of Alkatraz and the bay. They did offer to set up a machine to help reduce the smell but we declined because you had to vacate the room for a few hours and we were tired.As far as the beds go I would not say they were the best but they were comfy. The noise level was 0, so I am not sure who the complainers stayed next door to.We were also within walking distance to pier 39, Little Italy and Little China *granted a bit of a walk* and all the bus and street car lines.I would recommend it to anyone vacationing there. Also parking was the cheapest I found after calling around to 5-6 hotels."
165,2142,"Oct 2 2007 	Great hotel in great location	After staying at this hotel for a week, I find it hard to understand any negative comments about the Radisson. We arrived at the hotel well before check in time after a 13 hour flight. We were given our room immediately which was greatly appreciated. The location is excellent, right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf. There are plenty of places to eat very close to the hotel, we didn't miss an on-site restaurant at all. All hotel services were A1 in our opinion from room service right through to the concierge services.If we are fortunate enough to visit San Francisco again I would definitely stay at the Radisson."
166,2142,"Sep 26 2007 	nice location pretty good deal	Very good location. Decor is a bit design on a dime, but the important things were fairly nice-like the bed, little desk and chair, and shower. Pretty comfortable beds and linens. Clean. The layout of the hotel is a bit labrynth like. Don't forget to factor in the cost of parking ($30/day which is a pretty good deal in san fran). I'd say for the price it was a pretty good bargain. The rooms were a bit small, but you are in the middle of a big city so this is pretty much the norm. The Sheraton right across the street looked like they were doing renovations so that may be something else to consider if planning a trip, but the Radisson has the best location."
