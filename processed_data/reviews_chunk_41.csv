13,932,"Sep 15 2009 	Ordinary hotel with no charme and little out of Central London	My husband and me chose the Marriott Regents Park because we were in London to visit some friends who then got married at Chewton Glen, New Milton (see separate reviw) and they lived nearby, so they suggested us this hotel. We are Marriott Reward members so we were happy to gain some more points.I was little disappointed with this Marriott. Nothing really to complain about, but nothing great to point out.The hotel is pretty old and shows its age expecially from inside. Rooms are quite small  but ok if you consider the standard in London. The bathroom we had was old, small and surely disappointing. It would have needed a massive redecoration. The room overlooked the street and was noisy. Beds were confortable, as always happens at Marriott, and the room was kept enough clean during our stay.The lobby is much nicer than the rooms with a Marriott touch. Associates of this hotel were very kind with us  although we did not have any special needs. The neighborhood is ok, we went out also at night and did not have any kind of problems. The nearest tube station is Swiss Cottage which is 5 minutes walk away. The area is 2, so little outside from Central London. In spite of the name, Regents Park is not too close.We did not try any of the facilities of this hotel but I saw a very nice fitness centre  and an advertisement at Swiss Cottage Tube station claimed that it was open to public for a limited fee. Internet cost a lot.We paid our stay 160  per night and thought it was not too worth. This hotel is ordinary and shows no personality. I would not be back for such a price."
14,932,"Sep 7 2009 	Great Value and Friendly Service	We stayed here overnight when we attended a wedding at the hotel. The staff were very helpful and friendly and breakfast the following morning was substantial. The room was a good size and well appointed. The only criticism was that it was quite noisy. As we had a 5 year old with us, we would have appreciated a quieter spot, especially as we had reserved the room quite some time in advance of our stay. However, that said, I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it."
15,932,"Sep 4 2009 	Exceeded my expectations	Apparently it is true that you have to take personal reviews with a grain of salt and realize that it is often those with a negative experience who are the most vocal. I was apprehensive about staying at Marriott Hotel Regents Park based on some of the less positive reviews, but I shouldn't have been. I stayed for 9 nights 2 weeks ago with my dh and 2 children - ages 13 and 9. I had booked the hotel through Orbitz and it worked out to about $160/night which is practically unheard of in an expensive city like London! The staff accommodated ALL of my special requests which included a room with a refrigerator (they brought one to the room free of charge), and a room that was quiet (they gave us a room on the 4th floor which was located on the residential side of the building -- Swiss Cottage is a beautiful residential area to stroll through). As far as slow elevators (lifts) which I have read about here...I have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. We never had to wait for more than a minute for one to arrive.The rooms were standard sized marriott rooms with two double beds, a desk, a tv with a dresser, closet, iron and ironing board, a small table with 2 chairs and a trouser press. The bathroom was a bit smaller than in other Marriott hotels I have stayed in in the US yet clean. My only complaints about the rooms were: 1) a less-than-adequate housekeeping cleaning one day. The following day I wrote a note on the doorknob housekeeping request and after that the room was spotless - the housekeeping manager even stopped by to check that everything was to our satisfaction. 2) the complete lack of towel racks in the bathroom which would have been nice in hanging up our wet towels and bathing suits.Which brings me to the next positive. The pool. The pool was great for a family with kids. It was clean and well kept and provided the perfect respite after a day of sightseeing. It also had a steam room and sauna. I didn't use the fitness center, but from what I could see it was very nice. There is a hair/nail salon as well which I didn't use.  My dh's only complaint is that there wasn't a complimentary newspaper and free brewed coffee at the hotel - they give instant in the rooms, but we ended up getting takeaway coffee across the street at a cafe in the Community Center each morning. There are 2 restaurants in the hotel -- Chats which is a bar/grill and Brasserie Centrale which is a more formal restaurant. We did not eat at either one as they were clearly overpriced. Plus, there are a huge number of other restaurants within a very short walking distance on Finchley Street. We walked up and down Finchley almost every evening finding a new place to eat. The O2 centre is about 12 minutes away by foot and offered many restaurants, a huge bookstore and a Selfriges. There is also a Marks &amp; Spencer and a Waitrose grocery store on Finchley which came in very handy for us to buy breakfast foods and fruit/water/juice for our fridge in the room. In fact we never ate breakfast anywhere else saving both money and time.The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Swiss Cottage Tube Station. The tube will have you to Baker Street in 5 minutes and central London in no more than 10 minutes. Primrose Hill and the London Zoo (a must for dd) were a 15 minute walk. The Jubilee line was down for maintenance on the weekend, but we just hopped on the buses which stop right before you reach the tube station. So easy and the kids loved riding on top.Mid way through the trip we ran out of clean clothes, so the concierge gave me directions to the nearest laundrette. I did wish that the hotel offered a washer and dryer because there was no way I was going to pay the prices they charged for laundry service. Doing it on my own killed about 2 hours, but dh and the kids went swimming in the pool and everyone was happy.So my overall impression of our stay at this hotel was very positive. If you are looking for a luxury facility where you step out your front door into the heart of London, then this hotel probably isn't for you. But if you are willing to sacrifice 10 minutes a day of travel time to stay in a beautiful neighborhood in a very reasonably priced hotel that is perfect for families, then the Marriott Regent's Park is the place for you"
16,932,"Sep 3 2009 	Good Value For Money - Ideal for Non-Fussy Business Travellers	Stayed here for a night in August 2009. The hotel exterior as has been said before is bland and thoroughly unimpressive. The lobby area is spacious but a bit cluttered. the rooms are quite spacious (or maybe I just got a family room). Difficult to have any paticularly great views. The staff do their jobs professionally, which is great and ideal for business travellers who want to get in and out as quickly as possible. Taxis readily available on the hotel's doorstep and Swiss Cottage tube station on the Jubilee Line (Zone 2) is a very short walk away. I'd recommend this on value for money basis and also for business travellers who do not want to stay in the heart of the City. For holidaymakers - London has a wider choice to offer, particularly if you are after the whole London experience."
17,932,"Aug 31 2009 	Terrible maintenance - good location	This is not an inexpensive hotel. Based on the category and cost, I expected something similar to the Marble Arch or County Hall Marriott's where I've stayed in the past. And I'll say that the Concierge was VERY helpful. (Otherwise I'd have given it a 1 bullet rating.)This hotel is WAY WAY below those hotels in maintenance and customer service. {To some extent it might depend on the room or floor you get. Our friends on a different floor had their rooms made up by early afternoon and they had hot water.} Our room (and other guests in the elevator) had tepid hot water. Our room was never made up before 6pm except one day that my wife called housekeeping steamed about the after-6pm-service the previous day. The room was made up when we returned to the hotel at 4pm that day but only that day.The sink stopper was installed incorrectly in our room and the sink would not drain. I called maintenance twice about this before giving up. Getting on your knees you could push the lever and make it drain slowly. Seeing that they weren't likely to fix it, I asked if we could have another room. No other King rooms available. I offered to take a room with 2 double beds. They had those but they were 'saving them' for guests with larger families.Internet service in the business center was 5 pounds (at this time that's about $8) per 30 minutes. The net access speed was satisfactory. There were 3 internet cafe's within a 15 minute walk but one was never open when I went by, one was down but the computers could be used for editing, and one (the Kodak store) was (according to our friends) incredibly slow. So figure on just paying the $16 per hour.We were booked for 7 days - had it not been for having friends also staying there after I had picked the hotel, I would have been out the 2nd day.This hotel - for this stay for OUR room - was way overpriced. I would rank it as a 2 star hotel. The Conceirge was better than average. Maintenance was well below average. Your experience might be better. Our friends were on the 2nd floor - we were on the 3rd."
18,932,"Aug 30 2009 	not bad but room stunk of fags and staff rude	the hotel itself is actually quite nice, we book a no smoking room but were told there were none, but were reassured that it would not smell and if it did just say and they would spray it, any way it stunk so I went baqck to reception and told the guy only for him to be rude, it eventually got done on the forth time of asking. watch what they take off your card they take an extra 50 without asking apparently to save you carrying cash , only if they dont tell you how can you spend it , i was mad when i discovered this , how dare they take cash without permission!. hint if you are there at the weekend pay the 2,50 to get breakfats inyour room the queue was massive , felt sorry for the poor sods, best not to have a first floor room either we enjoyed the music from the wedding below ( not)"
19,932,"Aug 26 2009 	Excellent family hotel	I always find it hard to get a room in London for 3 adults, the Holiday inn add on 20 - 50 extra per night for a third adult sharing. Our eldest son has autism so he needs to be in the same room as us. This Marriot hotel did not cost any extra for a third adult sharing a room and that was one of the reasons for choosing it.I booked the room for 2 nights 3 months in advance and it included breakfast for 2 people. When we checked in they said that breakfast was not included but I had a copy of my conformation email which stated breakfast included. That was sorted out as they took a copy of my email and added breakfast.We were very pleased with the room as it was a quiet room on the second floor overlooking King Henrys Road. The beds were very soft and comfy and we slept well. The bathroom was on the small side but it had every thing you needed and plenty of towels. I did not care for the smell of the toiletries as the reminded me of citronella smelling candles to keep flies away.There was a good choice at breakfast including full English items and continental pastries, meats, cheese, smoked salmon, fresh fruit, cereals and toast. Drinks included tea, coffee, iced water and a selection of fruit juices.The hotel is in a good area close to Swiss Cottage tube station and the bus stops on Finchley Road for the short bus ride into London. As well as seeing many of the London sights we had a walk around the local area taking in Primrose Hill ( enjoyable larger taken in The Washington on Englands Lane ) Another walk took us along Chalk Farm Road and we ended up at Camden Lock with its many markets. If you go on to Adelaid Road you can get the C bus up to Highate and go onto Hampstead Heath for a picnic as we did or go the other direction to Brent Cross shopping centre. The cost of a Taxi journey to Kings Cross station from the hotel was 10.50 and a Taxi from Green Park Piccadilly to the hotel was 15.00 before tips.We would recommend this hotel and we will be staying again."
20,932,"Aug 21 2009 	Great Help from Front Desk and Concierge	I agree that the outside isn't anything to write home about, but the room was fine. The breakfast was great (the scrambled eggs were the best I've ever had). Our room was to include breakfast for 2, but they never charged my daughter for breakfast and said her's was included too. I want to commend the staff at this hotel. Our luggage was lost and the concierge went out of his way to call the airlines to help us locate the luggage. Also, my wallet was stolen out of my purse. Don't know how this happened because I'm always so careful - so please be very diligent in paying attention to your purse. The front desk called the police department for me and also followed up with a phone call to see how everything went. Also, when I checked out, the girl asked me if I had gotten my wallet back. Of course I hadn't.If I ever went back to London, I would definately stay here again."
21,932,"Aug 17 2009 	Excellent Hotel no complaints	Stay here for three days, great hotel, large room, clean and quiet. Great pool. Very close to tube station."
22,932,Aug 15 2009 	Very comfortable clean beautiful!	We stayed 3 nights at this hotel with our 13 and 15 year old kids. The hotel was very nice inside with a indoor pool and nice fitness center. Restaurant on site and great breakfast! The rooms were very updated and nice with really comfortable beds. The hotel is very close to the metro station making transportation easier as this hotel is only near the wax museum. We would definitely stay again and again!
23,932,"Aug 13 2009 	That 70s Hotel...	Booked their &quot;3 for 2&quot; special and thought I was getting a good deal at about $160 a night after the discount. I have a friend who lives a block away which was great, and Bond St is only a few stops away on the Jubilee line; otherwise the location is unremarkable. The outside of the hotel is quite run down and depressing, with paint peeling off the metalwork and dirty brickwork everywhere. There are several spots under the overhang in front of the building where rainwater leaks from the downspouts. Inside the hotel is very clean but the orange carpet in my relatively large &quot;Deluxe&quot; room was right out of my parent's living room, as was the 19&quot; tube TV. The other annoying detail was that there was only one unused outlet in the room.Having said all that, the most bizarre thing about this stay was they put me in a room right next to the Terrace Suite, and when I got there, the doors between the rooms where open. Naturally I assumed they'd given me the suite (perhaps because of the late booking?) so I spent the next two days taking advantage of all the extra space. The last night I was there I called down for cutlery on the phone in the other room. When told I would have to pay the tray charge of 2.50, I said I would call back and order something. Right away the phone rang and I was politely informed that I was not supposed to be in that room and that someone would be checking in shortly, and could I please vacate the room in the next 10 minutes? This after the cleaning staff had been through twice. Needless to say it was a bit awkward and embarrasing.Service at check-in was fine, and the breakfast was okay."
24,932,"Jul 30 2009 	Good value for families. Pool safe neighborhood easy tube access	Overall it's a three star hotel. Nothing fancy, but a good value. Clean rooms, kind staff, safe surroundings and easy tube access. Short walk from Primrose Hill neighborhood and Regent's Park where you can experience a bit of London charm without the shuffle of tourists. Pros: Comfortable beds and linens, pillows nice. Nice and clean pool to unwind kids at end of day of sightseeing, staff is professional and kind, taxis always available out front, easy access to tube, safe location, short walk to park and restaurants, Bar (Chats) is family friendly, menu has items for kids and adults, food was good.Cons: Exterior of hotel needs refurbishing, hotel lobby over perfumed with musk scent, breakfast overpriced and breakfast tastes average. Wait-staff friendly, but slow. For these reasons I give it a 3 star rating, but otherwise the hotel is very good.So, more positives than negatives - would stay again with family because rooms were comfortable and accomodated our 11 &amp; 12 year olds nicely, they enjoyed the pool a lot too."
25,932,"Jul 28 2009 	Nice location - big room and good pool	I stayed here for 1 night with my husband and 5 year old twins. It was a little strange as the last time I stayed at this property was 30 years ago as a child visiting London! The hotel was quite nice - our room was very big (for London) and quiet. Kids loved the pool and breakfast was great. I like Swiss Cottage a lot, although it is not the most convenient place to be based if you want to be in central London - esp as the Jubliee line was not working when we were there. And there are not loads of restaurants very close, but enough to survive! There is a great little park behind Swiss Cottage Leisure Centre and Library which was really good for the kids."
26,932,"Jul 27 2009 	Excellent Hotel will stay again!	Stayed here as the prices in central London were too high. I couldn't believe it when it was only 15 minutes tube journey from Waterloo! It was quicker than staying at my regular hotel and walking to my meeting! The staff on reception were very friendly and professional. I ordered room service dinner, which was excellent - my Rib Eye Steak was superb. Rooms are a great size, absolutely spotlessly clean. So close to Swiss Cottage Tube - will definitely be staying again!"
27,932,"Jul 23 2009 	Very badly run poor management...should not be called a Marriott hotel	We arrived at 7pm on a Friday night after an horrific 3 hour trip from Gatwick Airport in the rain to be told by the receptionist that we should have been there at 6pm as they were about to give our room away!! No where on the confirmation/booking does it mention a time limit, except that they charge your credit card for a night if you don't arrive! 1 of the 3 lifts was out of order and stayed that way until we left on the Monday morning; the second lift also had issues with doors getting stuck and not opening. The rooms had all the amenities, but felt dark and daggy. We had booked the room 6 months in advance and of the many rooms in the very big hotel, were given one on the noisy side close to the busy street. On the Saturday night at 1am, the fire alarm went off and after about 5 minutes we looked out to see people were leaving there rooms and going down the fire stairs to the outside. At no stage did we see any staff directing anybody. 1 Fire engine arrived and we were advised that it was a false alarm. There was a sign at the lifts asking guests to note that 9-10.30 was prime time for breakfast and one should try to make breakfast before or after! Breakfast was chaos, staff unfriendly and hygiene very poor....children touching bread, rolls, etc, food uncovered and no staff to supervise. The best was checking out. The location was great ...near the tube, but this hotel is not in Regents Park it is in Swiss Cottage! Maybe Regents Park sounds grander. If you have stayed in a Marriott in the USA then don't stay here...it is not a four star hotel by any stretch of the imagination."
28,932,"Jul 22 2009 	mostly nice good amenities	This was a repeat stay, so overall I like the hotel for its location. And I generally like the Marriott hotels. This is a business class hotel, so most amenities are there. Great fitness center and pool. Rooms are comfortable, nicely sized, acceptably clean although not spotless. The location at Swiss Cottage is a lovely section of London and there are plenty of restaurants, pubs, and markets nearby. A nice feature is proximity to Primrose Hill and the park for walks and views. Jubilee tube line is just two blocks away with good bus connections too. The hotel gets crowded with families on weekends.The staff is friendly but reliability here continues to be a problem. Example: My hired car for the early departure did not get scheduled, a room issue took a couple requests; and for a repeat time my bill was neither correct NOR ready at checkout (watch out for bogus minibar charges) and had to be mailed by post. Not disqualifiers but annoying. A few peeves: slow elevator service; mattress was not comfortable; no complimentary bottle of water in room ; internet is 15BP/day. Other: my recent package included breakfast for two but not the three family members scheduled and despite my repeat business (normally I travel alone) they would not add one. I knew this ahead but just bad business relations - walk across the street to the community center restaurant (opens at 7), or others nearby, all quite good (and free wifi). Anyway hotel weekend breakfast not served until 7:30AM (I schedule early business meetings) or 630 weekdays."
29,932,"Jul 21 2009 	Great Family Hotel	We just returned from a wonderful trip to London and Paris. We struck gold with both hotels we chose.Since we were staying in London for six nights and our teenaged boys are both 5'10&quot;, we needed an American-sized room with queen-sized beds so they would be comfortable. We all slept incredibly well...very comfortable beds and air conditioned rooms. There was a rare heatwave while we were there, so it was wonderful to come back to the hotel room and cool-down.The bathroom is just like the typical, small American bathroom. There were shelves to organize our toiletries and keep the counter clean. Beware...the shower tub is high and you have to step down when you are getting out - hold onto the bar!!The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and professional.This hotel is in a residential neighborhood so there are no other hotels, very few restaurants; although walk up the main street, Finchley Road, and there are a few banks, grocery stores, etc. You will become very, very good at using the tube. It is an easy 10-20 minute tube ride into town - only inconvenient when the Jubilee lines goes down for service (it was closed the whole weekend we were there) and then you will need to walk up Finchley to the Metropolitan line (10 minute easy walk) or take a bus to that station or take a bus into town, which is slower, but we didn't have any problems reading the bus maps. We had purchased Oyster cards (at the transportation center at Heathrow - they were very helpful) so it was very easy to jump on-and-off the buses and trains as necessary (note: children 14 and under are only 1 GBP a day when traveling on weekends and weekdays after 9:30 am - don't buy them an Oyster card, buy their travelcard each day). Loved the transportation in London - easy, clean and almost entertaining. Paris was much more of a challenge.We did not use the hotel's business center as I knew in advance that it was very expensive. Very close-by is the Swiss Cottage library - you will pass it on your way from the tube to the hotel. I went inside and explained I was staying at the Marriott and asked if was possible to receive a pass to use their computers. They gave me a 3-month membership for free so I could use the computers!We gave up the free breakfasts that many hotels offer in order to get the larger hotel room. We asked for a refrigerator, which was provided at no extra charge! There was a small market that was open 24-hours across from the metro station and we bought milk, juice, etc. and ate in the room - saved us quite a bit of money. There is a safe in the room and a hairdryer - it's in a bureau drawer. We needed to go to St. Pancras to get to the EuroStar. The concierge recommended a taxi, which we thought was going to be very expensive, but it wasn't - about 15 GBP and they were able to fit all four of us with all our luggage. Don't try to save a few bucks by dragging it up and down stairs in the tube - take the taxi. The concierge reserved one for us early in the morning and he was there right on time waiting for us.At St. Pancras, we turned in our Oyster Cards to get our deposit back (3 GBP/card) and transferred the GBPs to Euros so we had some money as soon as we got to Paris. We stopped in at the Marks &amp; Spencer, picked up some very reasonably priced sandwiches, drinks and snacks before getting on the Eurostar."
30,932,Jul 10 2009 	Good Hotel Don't Judge it by its exterior	Good Hotel. Clean Modern Rooms. Close to Underground. Arrived early to the hotel our rooms were not ready but were offered smoking rooms we decided to wait and dropped off our bags and went exploring. The hotel is in a good safe location. We were only staying one night as we were going to a concert. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and modern with a large bathroom.
31,932,"Jul 7 2009 	okay for the money	The Regents Park Marriott in London, while not a great hotel, can be a good deal by London standards ($200/night including tax). Be careful on checkout: the hotel tries to get to you to pay in US dollars after adding a large currency exchange surcharge even though they claim otherwise; I gave them only three stars because of their lack of honesty on the exchange rate and because of their poor attitude when I caught them and asked to be billed in pounds. They also charge $2.50/local phone call and $25/day for internet which is more than the Beverly Wilshire charges; this is an inconvenience. I booked the hotel because it is close to Regents Park for running, it is close to Triyoga in Camden, and it has a gym and a pool. The local area is forgettable with poor restaurants, but the tube is close by and the hotel does a great job keeping taxis available. The exterior of the hotel is ugly and rundown; the inside is a bit soulless and generic but in very good condition. The rooms are large by London standards and the marble bathrooms are very nice. The elevators are slow and in poor repair so you want to avoid going to/from your room during when the hotel is busy. The breakfast is very pleasant because the waitresses are cute, friendly, and have very british accents; however, there are enough Russians in London that one could be hired as a consultant to pick out good bread. The pool looks nice but is intensely used by very young children so I skipped it because of questionable hygine (if you know what I mean, and I think you do). The gym is nice and has large windows and a views of the pool and garden; the cardio equipment is excellent, but there is no bench press. The jogging in Regents park is excellent especially the running along the Regents canal. If you combine the outer path of Primrose Park, the outer loop of Regents Park with a run along the full length of the canal path you do a solid 12-13 miles. I was surprised the Brits are such good runners; perhaps the ban of smoking in pubs has improved their cardio fitness, but still with that British food it is amazing they are reasonably fast."
32,932,"Jul 6 2009 	Terribly Managed Hotel	Described as a &quot;luxury hotel&quot; on the Marriott website, this hotel is probably the worst run Marriott I have ever stayed at. I have had to beg for towels almost every day. Some days, we have not been given any hand towels or wash cloths, which is quite ironic since my profile on the Marriott website for Marriott Reward participants spcifically requests EXTRA towels and we couldn't even get the basic allotment! The hotel charges 75 British pounds (about $125.00 U.S. dollars) for a week of room internet service , which is billed as &quot;high speed&quot; but it's so bad that it can take an hour to get onto a website. On one morning of my vacation, I had to spend three hours in my room waiting for the hotel engineer because the hotel's internet system would not allow me to log on. Another day, my friend waited on her laptop for an hour but could not get on to participate in a video conference. A manager on duty earlier in my stay told me that she would &quot;take care&quot; of the internet charges since the service had been so bad. However, when I asked for a printout of my bill two days before leaving, the charges were still there. She had not followed through to refund me for what she had called an &quot;embarassment&quot; for the hotel. I have also had to ask repeatedly for turndown service, certainly a minor thing but asking once should have been enough. One night, they turned down both beds but left a mint on only one of the beds, completely ignoring the other bed in the room.Pretty amazing.Also, the bathroom sink doesn't drain well and backs up. The room is either freezing or stuffy and there's no way to get air circulating without the air being either cold or hot. One afternoon, I asked the concierge for suggestions for a Persian restaurant and he said he would slip a note through the room door before he left fo the day and also ask his replacement when he went off shift to call us. Needless to say, he didn't follow through either. Another day, the cleaning staff left a plastic spray bottle of their cleaner on top of the television set! In addition, the restaurant food was absolutely horrible one morning when I decided to have breakfast here. It wasn't even mediocre but was inedible.This is my 3rd stay here in about two years. The hotel is clean and the rooms are very quiet and large. Staff are very nice. The location is great with access to the restaurants of Hampstead, to Regents Park and to a nearby tube station. But it doesn't seem that anyone is actually managing the hotel, training staff about how to do their jobs or training supervisors about how to monitor staff and hold them accountable. It's too bad because it could be a nice hotel."
33,932,"Jun 27 2009 	Our fantastic trip to London	We just returned from a 10 day trip to London/Paris. We flew from Chicago to London because it was easier for us to get a flight from Chicago to London than to Paris. My husband booked us at the Marriott Regent Park, London after doing some research. I hadn't been to London in over 25 years and wasn't familiar with the hotels. We were 3 people. A grandmother (68 yrs), mom (49 yrs) and a teenage girl (16yrs). We were sceptic booking this hotel after some of the reviews on TA, but this hotel was great for us.The beds and room were very comfortable, we felt as if we were at a finer Marriott in the states. Some reviews said that the elevators were slow, that is absolutely not true. So, it's always good to do some of your own research as well as using advice from people on the travel websites that may be disgruntled for whatever reason. This hotel was in a great location: Regent Park area close to the Swiss Cottage Tube Station(which we had no problem using). We walked around the area and felt safe. Finchley road (close by)has many stores, post office, atm machines, movie theatre, restaurants, etc. This hotel also has a pool, which we didn't have time to use, but looked clean and nice. The only thing I do recommend is to hire a private car in adavance(online) before your trip to have them pick you up from the London Heathrow airport when you arrive, because it is quite a distance from this hotel. We book online with British Airport transfer and it was 39 pounds which is much cheaper than the London black taxis. There are other transport companies as well which you can book with. We also took a cab from this hotel to St. Pancras train station (about 10-15 pounds) and only a 10 minute cab ride. This was another reason we booked this hotel, because of its proximity to the St. Pancras station where you catch Eurostar to Paris. All in all, the three of us truly enjoyed this hotel and would recommend it, especially to families. The staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful.We would definately stay here again."
34,932,"Jun 25 2009 	ok but	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights 19th - 22nd June, myself, my wife, daughter, and daughter in law. I had booked a family room with 2 double beds and had an e-mail guaranteeing us 2 doubles. On arrival I was informed that they didn't have a room with 2 doubles and we would have 1 double and a pull out bed. Fortunately I had printed off their guarantee and had a copy with me and I insisted that they provide what I had booked. The receptionist went off to try to sort it out. She returned after 10 minutes to say that they had found us a room as requested but it was not ready and would we like a complimentary drink at the bar while we waited,(which we obviously accepted). The room we were given was very nice and quite spacious although the bathroom was a bit small with no walk-in shower and it turned out to be a bit noisy at night. We only ate in the hotel once and that was breakfeast on the Saturday morning but this was extremely satisfactory (but expensive, 16-99p each). Drinks were also very expensive but there is not a lot of choice if you go into Swiss Cottage or Primrose Hill, where are all the pubs. One final word of warning, car parking is 25 per night and the swing into the car park is quite tight and if you have a very big car it will need some very careful driving in order not to scrape it, big 4x4's and long saloon car owners beware."
35,932,"Jun 25 2009 	Decent Location	I could have chose a hotel more in the thick of tourist location destination, however those hotels were out of my price range. So this Marriott was well into downtown, and a residential area, yet only a coupld of blocks from an underground station (Swiss Cottage). Check in was interesting. We arrived at the hotel at noon and they said our rooms would be ready in 90 minutes. My colleague chose to take a smoking room, so she could drop her bags and go sightseeing. I decided to wait the 90 min. in the exec. lounge and do some work on the internet. Two hours later I called down , but my room still wasn't ready. 3 hours later, when check in is the &quot;official time&quot;, I went down to the front desk. They said my requested king room still wasn't ready and offered me a double. (I'm a platnium member), so I was kind of disappointed. I told them I'd continue to wait for a king bed. I was only to be there one night and all I wanted to do was sleep.. Within 15 minutes, they upgraded me to a suite (which was probably available at noon); but I was just grateful to get a bed. The suite room was sort of odd as it had a shade that went from a normal type window to up onto the ceiling and would not open. But the room, by London standards, was really lovely and huge.  I was there to rest in between two lengthy flights, so I only walked around the neighborhood to see if I could pick up some souveniers. There were quite a few shops in the area so i was happy. Although Wimbleton was going on while I was there, I could not find a wimbleton T Shirt anywhere, not even the airport. hmmmmmmmmmm????The executive lounge left much to be desired. I thought all Marriott' abroad offered complimentary cocktails, but not this one. that's okay. i didn't llike any of the food they offered. very weird squid things that was way too chewy. i did eat at the hotel resturants for the obligatory fish and chips and it did not disappoint me, it was very yummy. I was looking forward to the breakfast buffet, included, but it was a normal buffet. No scones, no soda break. boo hoo.I didn't use the pool, but have heard it is nice.For an overnight, it was decent."
36,932,"Jun 20 2009 	Lovely Hotel	My wife and I have always liked this hotel. It was originally called the Swiss Cottage Holiday Inn (when Holiday Inn's were considered posh in the UK) This most recent trip was to stay in the area for a night out. It was also quite a major wedding anniversary (30 years for long suffering wife!), so I requested Champagne and Roses in the room but no fuss. This was delivered impeccably, (the receptionist venturing a friendly &quot;make sure you come back for your 60th!). The hotel upgraded us to a lovely room and although we were not there for any length of time, found the service excellent.For visitors to London, the only possible drawback is that it is not on the door step of anything (I actually think that is a blessing) but cabs appeared plentiful and Swiss Cottage tube is only a 5 min. walk."
37,932,"Jun 19 2009 	Quiet area of London	We stayed for a total of three days, two at the beginning of our trip and one at the end of our trip. Check in the first time was lengthy because we arrived early in the morning and a room was not available, we were exhausted from flying the last 24 hours and decided to wait in the lobby instead of going off and sightseeing. The room was promised in 30 minutes but it really took an hour, we were very pleased with our room when we finally received it and other than this delayed check in we had a great experience. The concierge was helpful in confirming our bus tour for the next day and our transport to the airport. I was also surprised to find an &quot;american&quot; plug in the room, a nice touch since we each only had one adapter but several electronics to charge so we found the extra plug nice. One negative was that breakfast is not included and due to our scheduling both of our tour and flights we were departing before the restaurant ever opened. We also found the selection of restaurants in the area to be slim, the area is very residental and we found fast food near the subway station (swiss cottage) but other than that no real restaurants where we walked. We did walk to Abbey Rd and to Regents Park from the hotel and the neighborhood felt very safe. The underground station was a few blocks away, and very convient to use. Overall we had a nice stay and if needed I would stay here again."
38,932,Jun 19 2009 	Shame we had to work	This hotel was one of the best hotels I have stayed in whilst in London for ages! The staff were friendly the conference facilites were excellent and I intend to book our departmental meeting here in December and join the xmas party!
39,932,"Jun 12 2009 	Repeat Visitor - Always Taken Great Care Of by The Staff	Recommended by a colleague, repeat guest and have always had a great experience. I was last there in June 2008 for several nights, went to France for a week and when I got back after miserable French service, the staff gave me a beautiful room on the top floor -- the only bad thing about that stay was it was only for my last night in London. The rooms are always spotless, everyone on the staff is helpful and friendly (extra gold stars to David the concierge). Walk to Swiss Cottage tube station, the local area has one of everything (try finding that in overpriced, noisey Kensington or Belgravia) including a great Indian restaurant (Ericki) and a Waitrose."
40,932,"Jun 7 2009 	Nothing too much trouble	I arrived at this hotel after a nightmare journey from a European business trip, and frankly was in a pretty foul mood. The receptionist (I can't remember her name but she came from Berlin) was absolutely delightful and set the tone for every member of staff which I encountered during the whole stay. She mentioned that I had a nice room and it most certainly was - a huge sofa and a huge, huge bed. The location of the hotel is in a great neighbourhood and whilst it isn't that central, it's only a quick cab ride from the west end and the tube is about 10 mins walk away.I thought it was excellent and will definitely use this one as my London base in the future.E Bateman"
41,932,"Jun 3 2009 	Fantastic hotel exceptional staff that could not do enough for you	Lovely big rooms, very quiet, no traffic noise, the service from all staff was second to none. Great leisure facilities, with a more than adequate swimming pool.Favourite part, apart from great food, was the the size and comfort of the beds! Huge enough for a family!highly recommend this hotel, not only for meetings, but for a weekend/ mid week break,"
42,932,"Jun 2 2009 	nice but a long tube ride ahead	Maybe we just got spoiled as our first hotel was in south kensington right next too everything and this is a LOT cheaper option but if we had to do it over we would probably pay the extra money( about 800 usd for 6 nights) too stay in south kensington.Having said that this is a very nice hotel located about 1/4- 1/2 mile from the swiss cottage tube station.Pretty typical for a marriot ...nice big ,clean rooms 2 queen size beds and a good size bathroom also. Small balcony but stangely you can't go out on them as they only open about 5 inches or so.One word of warning for the area...there is a pub called the swiss cottage just when you exit the tube station I WOULD NOT GO IN THE PUB! The locals seemd to grumble at us when we walked in there ...the first time we thought maybe they had a bad day but the second time they were downright surly! The bar staff was no better they basically ignored us . First time in all our travels we have felt downright unwanted in a place but at least we can warn you folks !!Overall a good solid hotel ...just a long tube ride away from the action of london but the price is cheaper....BTW...internet is not free really a rip off 6 gbp for one hour or 24gbp for a full day!"
43,932,"May 26 2009 	5 star stay at Marriott Regents Park	My husband and I stayed here over the Bank Holiday weekend for 2 nights. They knew it was our wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to the most spectacular penthouse room - it was stunning. I couldn't fault a thing with this hotel - it had a great pool (although we didn't use it), and the breakfast was fantastic. I would say it is especially good for families (we are already planning a trip back with our two children) - they have films playing on the tv in the foyer for them and there is man who will make magic balloons.Primrose Hill is 10 minutes away and you can be in Camden in 5 minutes if you take the bus outside the hotel. The tube stop is 5 minutes walk away also. My husband said it would also be a great location for vists to Wembley. It has a lovely relaxed feel to the hotel and the staff are very welcoming.All in all we had a fantastic stay and can thoroughly recommend it."
44,932,May 25 2009 	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at the marriott for bank holiday weekend.We loved it. The pool was great to cool off after a hot day sight seeing.The breakfast was excellent and staff were very friendly and helpful.It is a five minute walk to an underground station into London.The room was very spacious and comfortable.Definitely recommend this hotel
45,932,"May 21 2009 	Saw BED BUGS on my bed YUKKK!	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night in Room number 247. (thank God, it was only 1 nightmare)!! At night i saw 1 bed bug while lying down with my baby. I never seen one before so i showed it to my husband. He checked it out on the internet with his laptop. He said it was a bed bug. I thought maybe it was only a one off incidence and it was late at night so we didn't complain. (We should have done it). But in the morning, i saw 2 small ones and 1 big one and plenty of blood when we killed them. My husband saw another big one as well. We called the reception to complain. The duty manager came and only offer the breakfast which we didn't need. Then we had a very rude attitude when we checked out. So I decided to write the true comment about them here. Now we're back at home and I'm still very paranoid about the BED BUGS."
46,932,"May 21 2009 	Mamma Mia and the Marriot!!!	Booked a family room for two nights. On arrival we were upgraded to the penthouse floor 7 - the room was spacious and the beds were huge! we had a conservatory style lounge area and a balcony.The fan in the shower did not work, when we told the staff they really could not do anything after all we were up on the 7th floor at no extra cost.........Was a bit miffed at having to pay for internet access, and i thought it was expensive.............Pool was great for kids, we had an evening meal the first night which was not cheap but the service and food were exceptional.All in all it was a wonderful week end and the Marriot was a great place to stay"
47,932,"May 18 2009 	lovely hotel just a bit far from the action	We stayed at the Marriott for the Race for Life in Regents Park in May 09, and were delighted with the size of rooms, great breakfast and ease with which to get to Primrose Hill and Regents Park. The hotel has a lovely pool with shallow end, great for kids and the breakfast is the usual Marriott high standard.As for location well you can walk up Swiss Cottage where there are the usual food restaurants and small shops with a Sainsburys in the O2 centre about 10/15 minutes walk away.Where this hotel loses out is location, on the weekend we were there Swiss Cottage Tube was closed for maintenance, so the next nearest tube then is a good 10/15 walk away (as apposed to 2 mins) so a Taxi to Oxford Street is needed cost 10 - just annoying nothing more...."
48,932,"May 16 2009 	Great hotel shame about the cost of parking	We stayed in this hotel as we had tickets for the 4th day at Lords and the hotel is in walking distance. The hotel was great, the room was large but on a very busy road so could not have a window open. Our break included dinner on the first night and the set menu was more than adequate for choice and was delicious. The next night we decided to eat out but the area to the north of the hotel is quite run down and we were a bit wary of going too far but we found a small Albanian restaurant the was packed but managed to squeeze us in. The nearest tube station is a bit of a walk and across a few busy roads.Our worst shock of the whole weekend was when we put our card in to pay for the carpark!!! 50 for 33 hours seems a bit excessive especially as the hotel is not in the centre of London. We usually stay at the Kensington Hilton and that has a reduced price for Hotel guests and works out around 30."
49,932,"May 6 2009 	GOOD POSITIONBUT AVOID ROOMS 527528 ETC AS THEY SUFFER SOME ROAD NOISE	Enjoyed the stay altough pricey like most London hotels,at least it clean and well maintained.My wife tried the pool but it is family based and not really any good for serious swimmers due to the length of the shallow end.We have stayed before in better room positions overlooking the the internal courtyard.This time we were overlooking the road and there is a lot of road noise(I am a light sleeper).My 84 year old Mother-in Law actually thought the hotel had a railway line going by,that's how load it was.We had no real compalints apart from the noise."
50,932,"Apr 24 2009 	nice serene place	Located close to Regents park, this place is in a very quiet place despite it's proximity to central london..The rooms could have been better. Ditto for business services like internet access and all.The executive lounge is a nice addition. u can have entry only if you are a Gold Member at marriott's or higher"
51,932,"Apr 20 2009 	Quality	Spent two nights here in a family room with the wife and kids. The hotel completely lived up to our expectations. The nearest tube station is a five minute walk, and is only three stops from Central London and so access to the tourist &amp; entertainment sights is good. The hotel has a pool which kept the kids happy when they needed a breather from the sightseeing and the room was very comfortable and well appointed. My only gripe is, why say you can check in after 3pm, when after a long day travelling you pitch up at 3.45pm to be told you cant have your room for an hour - just be more honest about check-in times please."
52,932,"Apr 10 2009 	A Great Hotel in good location for car travellers	WE had checked out of a terrible hotel so had nowhere to stay in London. A client mentioned this hotel and that it had been recently renovated. We were quite desperate after our experience at previous hotel so were over joyed to find the Marriott Hotel was up to standard. Excellent staff, room, car park and nice dining experience. The room was quite large for London - flat TV screens are on order but all other facilities were fine. The hotel caters of family and business with a lovely ambiance."
53,932,"Apr 9 2009 	Bit pricey	Nice enough, but a bit bland. Great breakfasts, pricey bar, comfy bed. Would I pay its prices out my own pocket - no!"
54,932,"Apr 2 2009 	Great Hotel!	Stayed here the 21st of March for 1 night. We're a family of 2 adults and 3 children and were given a room with 2 double beds and a rollaway. We had been informed that the room would be extremely cramped but we were happy with this as didn't want to pay for 2 rooms. The room was a lot bigger than expected and we had room to walk around all of the beds. We arrived at the hotel in the morning as wanted to spend the day in London and we were told that our room would be ready from 12pm onwards. Staff were extremely helpful, room was excellent and breakfast was the usual Marriott standard (we love the Marriott breakfast!). Excellent location as only 5 minute walk to the nearest tube at Swiss Cottage on the Jubilee Line. First time my children had been to London and they loved the whole experience and have asked to go back and stay at this hotel again. We had a fantastic nights sleep. The Marriott beds are the most comfortable beds in any hotel I've ever stayed at, I have a back problem and managed to have a great nights sleep. Excellent value for money because it was going to cost me a lot more to have stayed in a Travelodge because there's 5 of us. Will definitely be staying here again."
55,932,"Mar 29 2009 	Ok -- not bad not great	Recently stayed at the hotel for three nights. It was far from perfect, but not terrible either. Things got off on the wrong foot when we asked for directions to walk to the nearby restaurants, and we were sent the wrong way (they provide a map, which only confuses things  cant they dummy-proof something as basic as this???). So we ended up taking a cab, when its really just a 5 minute walk. The room we had was nice, though facing a fairly major street, so be sure to ask for a quiet room if this sort of thing bothers you. Theres a screwy lighting system, whereby you cant turn on the desk light to work unless the light by the front door is also turned on (I assumed the desk light was broken). And the switch for the bathroom light and the light by the front door are right next to each other, so I was constantly turning on the wrong light (a problem if other people are sleeping in the room).I was pleased to find an American power outlet in my room, but alas, it didnt work. And the wired Internet connection didnt work either. I eventually got it fixed  not before being given the wrong number for technical service, for which I was charged  but when I asked the front desk to remove the Internet access charge (a steep 15 pounds) they did (though the request was initially met with a rather surly response)The gym is quite nice, with a lot of equipment. The pool is nice too, though you cant really do lap swimming because one end of it is about a half meter deep. Very odd. Had a great chefs salad in the hotel one night. The breakfasts were ok  runny eggs and artery-clogging sausage and bacon, but fresh fruit also available. Checkout is at noon, and as we learned, your key is disabled exactly at noon (we were locked at about 12:01 p.m.). We were given a replacement, and then that one didnt work. So I had to return to the lobby a second time, to get a concierge to open the door. Never heard of this policy being used before. The location is nothing special, though its a very short walk to the Swiss Cottage tube. And you can also walk to restaurants in Primrose Hill. So youre a little off the beaten path, but central London is still easily accessible. We stayed at the hotel because friends lived nearby, and the rate was quite low relative to other hotels in London. While the staff is friendly, Im not sure wed stay again, unless we needed to be in the vicinity. Its a typical Marriott, which is to say it has little-to-no charm."
56,932,"Mar 24 2009 	FANTASTIC	We must of been lucky reading the other reveiws, my boyfriend and I arrived at 10am after catching the easy bus service to finchley road and walking about 12minutes to the hotel.  We were informed we were too early to check in, the entrance hall was lovely and the staff although all seemed from different countries/backgrounds had good English, the man we delt with told us to come back in an hour and he'd see what he could do- we were offered king smoking / non smoking. chose non-smokingwent away to explore the area, had breakfast in weatherspoons and returned to a different set of receptionist staff who said they cant promise or allocate rooms before check in at 3pm! well i got slightly upset and we decided to go into london town and come back, just as i was leaving i forgot something in the bag in the place they keep them for you. so went back in to get something and our friendly receptionist was back speaking and pointin towards me.. he came running along with a key and said sorry about the problem, so off me and my boyfriend went. Room 532Brilliant! see the photossooo soo clean, massive king size bed with duck/goose feather quilt/mattress topper and pillows. shower was okay, hot water and powerful enough, compliementary toiletriesEVERYDAY (3) our towels were cheanged and bed was made. the room was fine for travelling and exploring london, gettin the tube from swiss cottage on the jubilee was alright! but wont be for a couple of months/ years as planned engineering works are taking place, the buses from round the corner probs dont take too longday 2 we went for a swim at night, swimming pool isnt very great, very swallow and on a slope so cant really swim very far, no jaquzzi and no sauna as it was broken or something. never ate at the hotel.had a couple of drinks thought2 guiness cost my boyfriend 9 and i got a cocktail which forgot to get charged and tripple madoori and lemonade for 2.50... think i was liked?the balcony doors were shut as there was building works going on around the hotel? didnt really see any but the aircon wouls be sufficent. emm.. the king henry road side we were on was quite loud but we managed to sleep.. what can you expect in London anyway its a BIG CITY it's going to be Loud.."
57,932,"Feb 26 2009 	Erratic housekeeping pokey ill equipped room expensive breakfast	We had an enforced, lengthy stay at this hotel, local to us, during our recent building work. You need to ask for a quiet room on the King Henry's Road side. The housekeeping was erratic - some days no towels, others no loo paper, towelling robes not changed until requested and then they disappeared completely. Breakfast was hugely expensive and not good, instant coffee is served which is inexcusable. The restaurant is cold and uninviting. Staff were friendly and willing but mainly incompetent and unable to sort out the many problems we encountered. The hotel has recently been refurbished but our mini-bar didn't work and when we made enquiries, we were told that most of the mini-bars weren't working. We were offered a fridge but in the small room, there was no-where to site it. The leisure centre was under refurbishment and the swimming pool was closed. There is no shop in the lobby - as there used to be. High speed internet is available but hugely expensive as is the parking. This hotel is fine for a night or two but no longer and when you book, try to get a rate that includes the sub-standard breakfast."
58,932,Jan 25 2009 	Great service friendly staff and a good all round experience	I recently stayed at the London Marriot Hotel Regents Park overnight. The hotel itself is very well located for the west end and is very welcoming as you step through the entrance. The staff were friendly and highly professional and the rooms are well laid out and luxurious. The bar was very well stocked and the food (breakfast) provided many options to cater for all tastes and preferences. I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel. There was no fuss just a welcoming feel and excellent service and accomodation.
59,932,"Jan 23 2009 	Staff Helpful Management Lacking at London Marriott	My husband Jerry &amp; I chose Regents Park London Marriott for a 9 night stay because of its close proximity to the inner core of London and the rates were a little more reasonable for the week of Christmas to New Years. The staff were helpful, but several times were unable to operate the technology in the hotel. For example, the clock on the TV was off 10 min. and no one knew how to fix it for 4 days. The clock on the TV relates to when the pay movies come on, so we missed the first 10 min of the movie. The pay movies were very limited and local TV is limited too. Then the staff forgot to roll over the pay movies from one day to the next and the manager said &quot;We are on a learning curve&quot;. The mini bar was never restocked and at check out we found out that we were supposed to call and request the mini bar be refilled. Whenever you called housekeeping, you spoke to the front desk and then the front desk would call housekeeping and requests would get confused. Housekeeping was not consistent in supplying the variety and amount of towels and toilitries to the room. Room service was always dependable and the food was good; a service charge was always included. The hotel was full of families over the holidays. Doors were slamming with noise, but the hotel usually would quiet down by 11:00 p.m. Note: we also have a white noise machine running full blast which helps! We experienced 5 min. waits for the elevator routinely, so we tried the stairs, but were unable to access the lobby from the stairs which was a little scarry. What happens if there is a fire? The hotel is about a 10 min walk from Primrose Hill (south of the hotel) and Primrose Hill runs in to Regents Park and this was a nice walk even during the cold weather. The Zoo is about a 20 min walk from the hotel, heading south. The Underground Line Jubilee was not working the first 3 or 4 days of our trip, which was very inconvenient. The Jubilee access is about a 5 to 7 min walk from the hotel heading north. We took the bus for the first 3 days and the buses were crowded. A taxi ride from the hotel to Westminster Abbey was about $24.00 American dollars on a non holiday rate Taxi rides on holidays were time and a half. The Thai restaurant near the bus stop near the hotel has good food. In summary, we had a good time and the hotel was generally comfortable, but the management could do a better job! There is a lack of good management."
60,932,"Jan 17 2009 	1 of the best i've stayed in!	I booked my trip through show and stay as part of a theatre break and I chose this hotel and it was brilliant.We arrived at 10.00am not expecting to get our room but just leave our luggage and we were surprised and pleased to get shown to our room straight away. (checkin is 3pm) The receptionist was very friendly and helpful.the room was really good. A massive bed with plently of pillows to chose from. It was very comfy. The room was a good size and it was spotless. The bathroom was also spotless with plently of towels.Breakfast was very good also. Plently to hose from and filled us up for the whole day. Every member of staff we spoke to was more than helpful and always friendly. I don't know what peoples problem is with the lifts. We never had to wait. It always came striaght away.I have to say, after staying in quite a few hotels in London over the years, this really was the best. And I can't understand other peoples comments and I can be quite fussy!!!"
61,932,"Jan 2 2009 	Very poor service	Okay, we travel a lot. We live in London and had friends over and decided to book this hotel which is a 15 minute ride from our house. The hotel is in a great, north-central location, a kilometer from Regents Park, a 10 minute walk from Swiss Cottage tube on the Jubilee Line which gets you to Westminster station in fifteen minutes. So a great value for a London hotel. But it ends there. We booked the executive room for our one night new year's eve stay and the room was big, but the extra roll away bed was not in the room when we got there, and was delivered to us - not set up, just plunked down at the front of the door. The beds were so bouncy that it was impossible to get comfortable. Parking - even by london standards is an OUTRAGEOUS 25 pounds. The hotel staff, who spoke better Arabic than English (!) told us that the hotel validated parking. Not true. They do not and we were incredibly surprised when we checked out. And then the exit machine was broken and we along with other guests had to wait until some dummy returned from break to raise the gate to let us go. Regarding the food: the breakfast room was lined out the door and so we skipped breakfast altogether. But that was not the worst: it was New Year's evening and we, along with our friends and our kids were watching the fireworks from the Executive Lounge, which of course is reserved for 16 year olds and up. Well, together we had 5 youngsters, who were simply sitting watching TV with no-one else in the room except an older couple playing cards and another couple with a young child. A manager happened to walk by (yet again another fellow who spoke more Arabic than English) and actually asked us to leave. When we suggested that he break policy and allow us 20 minutes to watch the nice flat screen and welcome in the new year he said &quot;no, sorry, policy says so&quot;, and he actually had a security guard with him! So we left, although I gave this joker a piece of my mind, big time. The next day, our friends did not have their rooms made up until after 6PM, the shower water was anaemic and the bathrooms were desperately in need of upgrade.The only saving grace of this hotel was the pool and workout room which was good. But the service was SO BAD and the rooms so mediocre that it astounded the mind. In our own city, a world class city, to have such a bad experience is really an outrage. I want to let all Trip Advisor readers know: DO NOT STAY HERE. Go to Gloucester Road and stay at either the Millenium Gloucester or Harrington Hall for a much cheaper rate and minutes from Chelsea, a walk to the museums and a quick ride to Knightsbridge and the Parks. I hope (but doubt) that management will respond to this note, but in our 20 years of travelling in over 90 locations around the world, this was one of the worst experiences ever."
62,932,"Jan 1 2009 	Nice Hotel	I stayed in this hotel for two nights with my wife and two year old daughter. Hotel is a bit old fashion. The area is one of the nicest areas in London. We stayed on the 5th floor. We had no problem with the lift as it was the main down side of the hotel in the reviews. The room was spacious and clean, bathroom was spottlessly clean. Double beds were comfy. I did not like the pillows that were too fat. The only problem we experienced was balcony door locked. If anyone would like to get fresh air inside the room, it is not possible. The price included breakfast that was very good and plenty. We had dinner two nigts at the hotel and we liked the ambient. The waiter Serdar Ali was very polite to us."
63,932,"Dec 23 2008	hmmmm	Stayed at this hotel the last couple of days with my two children 10 and 9. Ok you can get to Swiss cottage tube in 5 minutes walk max (Exit 1 from underground). M&amp;S and Subway is less than5 mins (from exit 4)underground). To those who don't know know what M&amp;S is, you can stock up on snacks and goodies and wine and more at normal prices rather than the minibar! This hotel is ok but I won't rate it higher than that. The staff were indifferent. The rooms- oh dear.... Marriott please listen, your ghastly feather pillows are too small if using one and too big for using two. This coupled with an over hot room(turned down a/c as much as I could but to no avail) meant a sleepless night. Hideous sleeepless night for me and the kids. Thanks but no thanks.Won't be back."
64,932,"Dec 19 2008 	It grows on you	I spent a week there this month. I started at a low weekend rate and then was elevated to a higher weekday rate. When I first stayed here a few years ago, I didn't get a good impression. It was run down. The neighborhood was boring and somewhat threatening, and it just didn't feel right. On this trip though, the price difference was so large and the convenient access to the Jubilee and Metropolitan (finchley road) lines made access to our client's offices easy.The hotel has been re-done in the past few years, and it is clean and comfortable. Maybe it is me, but the area around the hotel feels like a cohesive neighborhood. The biggest issues I had are ultimately minor. The elevators are incredibly inefficient. Meeting somebody in the lobby? leave your room well ahead of time. The Concierge Lounge is below average for a Marriott. While they did have &quot;snacks&quot; available every night, quantities were very limited and when they run out of the first tray or two, they replaced them with onion rings (which were gone after the first two or three people. The breakfast there was acceptable to good, though the toaster was broken all week.The area restaurants are nothing to shout about. You are better off to just hop the Underground and just a couple stops later you are in the heart of the action.By the end of the week, I was looking forward to the &quot;close in, quietness&quot; of the hotel. I found myself relived to be back there at the end of the long day. While you can stay in a small boutique hotels close in for the same price, I would recommend this Marriott for those wanting a full service facility."
65,932,"Dec 16 2008 	Good Value Modern London Hotel	I stayed in this hotel by myself in December of 2007 to do some sight seeing and meet up with friends before going to stay with family in other parts of the country. I payed $115 for a successful bid on Priceline, which was about half the rack rate.It's a very pleasant, well appointed, freshly decorated and clean hotel in fairly typical Marriott style. I have stayed in so many 4* London hotels and frankly, they are very disappointing by American standards. Although the lobby and public areas are generally fine, the rooms tend to be small and shabby. You don't get king beds, you get doubles, and in twin rooms you get two singles. However, the twin room in this hotel did have two doubles (they put me in a corner room so it was extra spacious with windows on two sides).I enjoyed lunch in the cafe and took advantage of the free wireless there. I also had dinner in the main restaurant which was absolutely fine, but more like another cafe than a restaurant, with a rather limited and uninspired ( but quite reasonably priced) selection of food and wine (very 3*ish)I made use of the gym, which was small but well equipped and peeked in at the pool, which looked quite inviting.The hotel is about a 7 minute walk from the nearest tube station and then a 15 minute ride into central London. The immediate area is mixed, with some exquisite single dwelling homes and some dingy council flats. However, it is well lit and I felt perfectly safe walking by myself at night to and from the tube station. Despite the name, the hotel is NOT right by Regent's Park.For the price I paid, this hotel was excellent value. If I had paid full rate, I would only be giving it three circles. Next week I will be spending a night in the London Marriott Maida Vale ($106 on Priceline). It will be interesting to see how they compare and I will post a review of that in the new year."
66,932,"Dec 8 2008 	Superb London Stay	Having just stayed for four nights, making a long weekend break in London, I cannot honestly think of a better hotel to recommend. The reservation process was so simple and the staff were friendly and helpful every step of the way - something that continued when I actually arrived at the hotel and was maintained throughout my time there. The reception staff and concierge could not do enough for me - from recommending places to go and the best places to see, to getting theatre tickets and suggesting walking tours of London that left me with great memories. The food was superb in the hotel. There had clearly been a recent refurbishment of the hotel as everything appeared to be new and the condition of the hotel exceeded its four star rating. Although, the care and attention each staff member displayed probably means that the Marriott Regents Park is like this every day of the year!! It was truly outstanding, set in a great location to explore London and with staff members who were true service professionals. Mr Marriott and his organisation have something to be very proud of!!!!!!"
67,932,"Nov 29 2008 	loving it at 40	My friend, her daughter, my daughter and i went to London for my 40th and stayed at the Marriott i had read all the reviews and weas looking for ward to staying there ,as alot of reviews i have read we loved the breakfast there was so much to eat and amble coffee, and the rooms though it was weird when the tv switch itself on at 8am.The staff were really helpful especially letting us leave our luggage when we could not book in and where going watching Wicked. The beds where so comfy and the rooms where spotless. There was a longish walk from the changing rooms to the pool (so don't be shy), you also need a 1 coin for the lockers. We could not fault it at all and would definately stay again"
68,932,"Nov 17 2008 	Absolutely Fabulous!	Excellent location, extremely helpful/friendly staff, and modern hotel made our week's stay perfect. It's a hidden gem in Swiss Cottage. I dont know why they call it &quot;Marriott Regents Park.&quot; The park is a good 15 minute walk from the hotel. After researching hotels in London for a month, I found the Marriott in Swiss Cottage to be the best fit for us. We arrived just after 3.15pm. Unfortunately, we didn't get our room till 4 pm since it was a busy weekend. It was only problem we had with the hotel.The rest of our stay was perfect. Since I had time to spare on my first day waiting for our room, I researched the local area and walked to the shops and the local Marks &amp; Spencer to buy groceries. The walk to the Swiss Cottage tube station and shops takes about 5-10 minutes. I requested a fridge to keep certain food items refrigerated in our room. As you know, hotel food is expensive anywhere you go.The first thing I noticed was how nice the hotel was smelling. The hotel was built some time ago, but was renovated last year in 2007. The rooms and bathrooms are contemporary, of good size, and the beds are very comfortable. I wont recommend putting 4 people in one room as the hotel suggested you could do.The buffet breakfast is worth having. I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality and variety of foods presented. We had it included in our nightly rate. Try to do the same if you can. Its well worth it!I truly felt &quot;at home&quot; staying at the hotel. You know you're staying in the city, but since the hotel is also located in the upscale residential area of Swiss Cottage/St. Johns Wood, you get the best of both worlds. So if you dont want to be in the dead center of town, Swiss Cottage is 2 stops away on the Jubilee line from Bond Street (Marble Arch, Oxford Circus). Its ideal! I plan on staying at the hotel again when I visit London next spring. I hope you will consider it too!"
69,932,"Nov 4 2008 	Decent Homely Hotel	I stayed at Marriott Regents Park for 20 days in January 2008 for my business trip. Before going there, I was under an impression that it would be a magnificient hotel (basically on the lines of JW M) but I was unpleasantly surprised to see a small building just like a UK budget hotel.. (somewhat better than a Holiday Inn Express Hotel). The hotel did not stood up to it's Marriott Standard and was quite average. At the end of it, I thought, I should have stayed in another property of Marriott at London, or for that matter a 4 Seasons or a Hilton would have been a better choice.What I Liked about the Hotel??Now that I'd paid for the rooms, I better like something about it.If you forget the fact that it was a Marriott Hotel, there were many things to like about it. It was quite a peaceful hotel in one of the best areas of London, quite close to my work area and the Tube Station but away from Traffic and clamour of Oxford Street. The rooms were nice and huge and not very opulent which gave me a sense of belongingness and homliness. The food was also quite good, the best meal being the Breakfast.The stewards were very polite and overall the atmosphere was to make me feel like being at home.What I didnt like...Many things. Conicerge facility was useless and they didnt seem to be interested in assisting. The rooms were big but not grand. They lacked the feel of a big hotel and everything gave a hint of it being a budget hotel. The dinner was pathetic most of the times and the overall feel was &quot;boring&quot;My Take on it!!Go to this hotel only if your business purpose requires you to be at Central London and that too in the St Johns Wood Area or if you want to visit Lords. The hotel would not give you a feel of being a grand hotel, but would suit the bill if they give you some hefty discounts. You have better options like the Millenium nearby."
70,932,"Nov 3 2008 	Think well before you decide.	I should have chosen a more central location.Tube closed for two days , bus was bad .As you see old exterior , and our old window let in far too much traffic noise.The three lifts are large enough , but as reported keep you waiting for ages . Request a low floor.Small bathroom.My breakfast was included , but even the good staff could not make it a good experience , we gave up going for it .Option is to pay for tray room service.Large number of children , yet the good pool looked quiet when I passed .Room comfortable and staff polished.I had a very low room rate , (Marriott 3 day stay).Pleasant location for Primrose Hill and Zoo.I would not choose this hotel again"
71,932,"Oct 30 2008 	Busman's Holiday	Great, convenient hotel, located in Swiss Cottage area of London,close to St John's Wood and Regenst Park etc . Very easy access to anywhere in London. Stayed in executive room on 6th floor which was very spacious, clean, had modern/new furnishings etc and was well maintained. Great views across town. Bed was very comfortable. Check-in very smooth and staff helpful at all times. Rate was comparable with many others checked on-line. Didn't make breakfast due to business however, restaurant/bar areas (as with other communal areas) are very amenable."
72,932,Oct 15 2008	Short Stay	We recently had a short stay at The Marroitt Regents Park and the stay was everything I wanted it to be.The Reception staff were very friendly and All members of the staff were happy to help and nothing seemed too much trouble.The room was spotless and the bed very comfortable.The food was freshly cooked and very hot. All in all it was a wonderful experience
73,932,"Oct 15 2008 	Good Marriott standard rooms - expensive parking	When you book a Marriott, you expect certain things:1 - Comfortable room with good bed etc.2 - Enough room (even in a city center hotel) not to feel claustrophobic in the room3 - Good restaurantThe Marriott Regents Park ticks all these boxes. I could go on about how nice the breakfast was and how stylish the rooms were, but, you do expect these from a Marriott.I would make the following comments to be of specific interest:1 - Location - Excellent. 5 minutes from Swiss Cottage Tube on the Jubilee Line. I was on Picadilly (via a direct train to Green Park) just 20 minutes after leaving the hotel).Also - just off the A41, so easy to drive north to the A1 and M1. We left the hotel and were on the M1 just by Brent Cross just 20 minutes later - fantastic. Therefore, if you want a hotel close to the city center and easy to drive to, then this is a perfect place.2 - Cost of Parking - expensiveI understand that Hotels in London charge for parking, but, 25GBP a night with no discount for residents of the hotel seems a little steep (hotels in central london charge less than this - albeit often just for hotel residents). This latter point would not stop me staying at the hotel again if it was necessary to stay in the St John's Wood vicinity and I wanted Marriott standard rooms and service. But, if I was simply looking for a well connected hotel simply to sleep the night with access to Central London, (i.e. anywhere as long as I could drive by car and pick up a tube to get to London), then I would probably stay elsewhere."
74,932,"Sep 8 2008	Not bad but a few suggestions	Clean hotel, located in St John's Wood/Regency Park areas of London (nice neighborhoods) and convieniently located near Swiss Cottage Tube Station making it fairly easy to get anywhere in London. Great free breakfast.Room was clean, minibar well stocked and the bed was SO AWESOMEly comfortable. But don't plan on sleeping late. My room was 5 floors up and a corner room on the &quot;quiet&quot; side of the hotel (opposite side of hotel from busy street). Yet, I was woke up every morning either by traffic noise (garbage trucks, emergency vehicles) or the sliding closet door of my next door neighbor. The walls must be paper thin in the place.Concierge(s) were real hit andmiss; some very friendly and helpful and some nearly clueless about what you were wanting to know about and with huge accents making comprehention all but impossile.The TV selection was BORING! Just a few channels for free and nonsense stuff on each one.."
75,932,"Sep 2 2008 	Loved the hotel and will return	We stayed with our 2 years old daughter in this hotel at the end of August and we were fully satisfied.Staff was very helpful and comprehensive of the fact that our English is not fluent (we're French), especially the concierge who gave us all good information on the Swiss Cottage area.The location is great and very peaceful. To get to central London you can take the jubilee line or buses at Swiss Cottage station which is 5 minutes walk.Inside the hotel, the swimming pool is great for kids, I tried the sauna and steaming room too and have no negative point on it.The fitness room is well-equiped and not too crowded at night (it's open till 11:00PM).We had a Deluxe room with a Kingsize bed and didn't regret our choice, even if our daughter had to sleep with us. We had everything we needed in the room including iron, tea set and a mini-bar (that we used only to keep our daughter's milk cold ;-)The only questionable things were the TV which was a bit old (a flat screen would be better), but we were not there to watch it; and the elevators which I reckon are incredibly slow but hey, on holidays we can afford a 5 minutes wait!!!Anyway I recommend this hotel and will go back when in London."
76,932,"Sep 1 2008 	good and bad	I recently stayed 9 nights at the Marriott Regents Park. I have mixed feelings about the place. It is not exactly at Regents Park. The park is a 15-20 minutes walk which is rather pleasant if you go through the neighborhood and Primrose Hill park.The reviews here that mention the glacially slow elevators are dead on. This is especially a problem during breakfast time in the morning. It turns out there are some back stairways that are not well-marked if you don't mind climbing. Just ask the staff. Ask for a room on a lower floor.Our room was quite pleasant. They have clearly recently renovated the rooms. The bedding is very comfortable. The a/c is powerful. The tv is small with not the greatest picture quality, but I think that is par for the course in London. The room was a decent size. The bathroom was fine but it is odd that there is no exhaust fan. There was also an odd odor at times, but opening the window helped get some fresh air in.There is a busy road behind the hotel. If you are a very light sleeper that might be an issue. You may want to ask for a room on the front of the building which faces a quiet street.The Swiss Cottage tube stop on the Jubilee line is a short walk away. You can reach it by walking through the pleasant grounds of the community center/school across the street. Getting around by tube is quite easy.There are several good restaurants on the main street by the tube. Several Thai restaurants that were very good. There are a number of Indian places as well that looked good but we didn't get around to visiting them. There is a Marks &amp; Spencer food market and a little independent market nearby as well. There is a small internet shop that charges GBP 1 per hour on the strip near the Odeon movie theater.The hotel staff are generally quite nice, especially in the restaurant and the concierge desk.There was a bit of a mix up with our reservation but things were resolved quickly by the front desk staff.My biggest issue was the ridiculous fees. I suppose it is Marriott corporate policy. But $30 a day for internet access is beyond outrageous. And also do not use the phone in your room. Unless you have money to burn that is. We misread the chart in the info book. Rather than costing 99 pence per call for a local call it is 99 pence per minute! Our little 9 minute call to a friend cost US$23!!! That is highway robbery. And there can be no reason for it other than simple greed. Calls to mobile phones cost an unbelievable GBP 2.99 PER MINUTE! That is US$6. Marriott really should be ashamed of itself for stealing from its guests this way.We also knew some folks staying in the hotel at the same time who had their wallets stolen from their room while they were at breakfast. The computer records showed that three entries were made by housekeeping to their room during that time, but their room was not cleaned...just cleaned out apparently. There is a safe in the room. Use it.My roommate used the gym and found it to be good quality. People seemed to like the pool.Overall, we liked the location and the room was relatively comfortable. Breakfast was good enough, but for 9 days there wasn't much variety. London is a crazily expensive place. There is no way I would have paid $270 per night (taxes included) for a room of this caliber anywhere else in the world."
77,932,"Aug 28 2008 	Enjoyed the London Marriott Regents Park	We stayed a week in late August at the London Marriott Regents Park. The 3 of us had a lovely experience. Our son is a young adult; the hotel was able to give us a well-sized room for 3 people. The air-conditioning was fine. The bathroom was well-stocked with toiletries and towels, etc. We opted for the use of the Executive Lounge and that was well worth the cost! The breakfasts were way above average for a continental one; plenty of food choices. The staff was a pleasure to deal with. We arrived at 9:00 in the morning and within an hour, we were able to get into our room! Every bellhop went out of his way to help us. The concierge was always patient when explaining how to find various places.The location was nice. Swiss Cottage is a lovely, safe residential area. The trip to most sights was not that much longer than if we had stayed in central London and the Tube line - &quot;Jubilee&quot; - is clean and modern. We did notice that several times the elevator door did not open right away when it reached a floor. Our son enjoyed the pool, but he mentioned the water was a bit chilly sometimes.Overall, our experience was fine and we look forward to doing it again in the future."
78,932,"Aug 23 2008 	Shame we didnt get the chance....	After reading the reviews I finally settled on booking two rooms for two nights for my family to spend a long weekend down in London - that would be for me, my husband and twin 9 year old boys. I rang the Marriott's main reservation line and requested the two deluxe rooms with interconnecting doors at which point the helpful customer service lady asked me to hold whilst she was going to ring the Hotel's front desk requesting the interconnecting room numbers so that she could place it on the booking. Much to mine and her surprise she was told quite curtly that no interconnecting rooms at this hotel could be booked, and nor could they be guaranteed on the day of arrival! Needless to say I declined to go ahead with the booking which was a shame, as this hotel otherwise would have suited our needs admirably! I have since written to Marriott's Customer Services also to no avail receiving a very curt, impersonal reply that all rooms booked at the same time automatically are booked next to each other...which is about as helpful as a kick in the pants, as when I queried...&quot;sounds reasonable - but are they interconnecting though?...what happens if the boys need us in the middle of the night? - one has issues and may need assistance.....&quot; I'm still waiting on a reply...."
79,932,"Aug 20 2008 	a lot of problems	For London this hotel is a good value. The Swiss Cottage train station is close by and it is an easy trip to the center of London. However, service at the hotel is simply the worst I have ever expereineced at a Marriott. Getting my room was very slow and the first night there a breaker went off, cutting all electricity to one side of my room. No TV, no computer connections, no coffee service. I tried all evening to get someone to fix the breaker. Despite a dozen conversations with reception, no one could be found to fix the problem. The next morning I finally found someone to flip the breaker back on. It took about a minute of effort. Two nights later I tried to call downstairs at 9 pm to ask for a wakeup call. No one answered the phone. I tried over and over. I finally dressed and went downstairs. There I found three people at reception with no customers. They were young and spending the evening entertaining one another. They were simply ignoring the phone. This hotel badly needs better supervision of its young staff. They could care less about about taking care of the customers."
80,932,"Aug 17 2008 	Great value with minor issues	We had a similar experience as others. Nice hotel, excellent location near Swiss Cottage tube stop, great value for London, very clean, esp lobby/restaurant. It was the little things that kept this from a better review. The elevators need to be re-programmed. The bellboys were way too aggressive about taking bags at check-in. Room availability took awhile (3PM on the dot, no earlier). The other issue was not the hotel's fault - many of the guests were large families with young children that were just left to run amok thu the hotel at all hours. Still, the local restuarants on Finchley road were tasty, and a walk thru St. John's Wood found a terrific pub on our pilgrimage to Abbey Road studios. I'd stay here again - the value and relative convenience without the hassle or cost of being right in London center was well worth it."
81,932,"Aug 7 2008 	Fantastic hotel in a nice part of London	This Marriott exceeded our expectations. The lobby was new and bright, and check-in was very easy. The room was very American-like in its size and decor. It had a comfy bed with great bedding, updated bathroom, and excellent air-conditioning. We felt pampered. The hotel is in a safe area and close to the Swiss Cottage underground station, which was not overcrowded at all. The underground was very easy to use and took just a small amount of time to get to the theater district. The hotel had a nice restaurant, but there was also McDonald's, Subway, and KFC very close to the underground station. One of the best treats of the hotel was the concierge. He was cheerful and a wealth of information. Our visit to London would have been difficult and much less interesting without him."
82,932,"Aug 6 2008	Some good some bad	The Marriott Regents Park was a mixed bag, in my opinion. The Good:- 5 minute walk to Swiss Cottage (Jubilee line) and 15-minute walk to Finchley Road (Metropolitan line). This was handy having 2 subway lines to access, as it made it easier to get around to different parts of London.- The neighborhood around the hotel is mostly residential, but there were tons of shops and stores on Finchley Road (Subway, McDonalds, ATMs, Waitrose, etc). We used these a lot as they were only about 5-10 minutes from the hotel.- The exercise club is very nice.- The pool is good for families and young children.- The 2 double-bed room we had was big enough to hold our 4 family members and our luggage for 5 nights.The Bad:- Service at this hotel was below my expectations of a Marriott. E.g. it took 2 days/2 requests to get a plugged sink in our room fixed.- The staff really wasn't that friendly, or didn't really go out of their way to help you.- This hotel has THE slowest elevators in the UK. Everybody commented on this during our stay, even the staff!- The breakfast options were expensive--Full breakfast buffet for an adult was 17 pounds, continental was 13, kids were 6. For our family of 4 that was 43 pounds (close to $90CDN)!!! Needless to say, we only did that on one morning.- This hotel has the in-room pants press, but does not have an iron.- The blow-dryer is not in the bathroom--rather it was glued to a drawer in the desk in the room."
83,932,"Aug 4 2008 	Very pleasant	I agreed with RomaLucy's review after staying from 19th to 26th in July with our 11yr old daughter (2 adults, 1 child).We arrived 1:15pm and was told that room be ready in about 1 hour and our luggages could be stored for safe keeping. We were offered a room with 1 King Size bed as booked / pre-paid via expedia.ca. The Front Desk person offered us to change to a room with 2 double beds if we found problem in sleeping arrangement. We did not take the offer but obtained a extra temporary bed instead.We did not realized breakfast was included and were glad to find out when we asked the Front Desk about cost of breakfast. The buffet breakfast is wonderful to start our day.Yes, the elevators were slow; we stayed at 2nd floor and could not find the staircase unless we use the fire-exit. Only 2 (out of 3) elevators would stop (on the way down) at 2nd floor and they were always full during morning tourist rush hours. On the 3rd day, we pushed both &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; buttons and got into the elevator (all 3) even if it were going up. This allow us to get downstairs without long wait.The housekeeping needed constant written reminder to give us 3 sets of towels after initial 2 days of calling housekeeping to bring us extra towel when we returned after a full day of sightseeing. I also left a note asking the housekeeper to change the coffee mug after 2 days (we did not rinse the mug after trying out one tea bag and left it on the tray). This is the only negative experience we had.All personels working at this hotel were very friendly and professional.Overall, this hotel offers very good value for family travel / vacation, its location is good, room size is similar to what North Americans expectation, and short walking distance to Underground (Swiss Cottage), or even taking bus to various tourist attractions.If we travel to London again, we will choose to stay at this hotel."
84,932,"Aug 4 2008 	Ladies prepared to be seen naked!	Hotel overall was good, but a few items in the room required maintenance.I used the pool area twice during my stay and both times came out of the shower to get my towel, to be greeted by a man (different men each day). Neither of these male staff were in a great hurry to move and one would not move or look away while I walked past to collect my towel (I initially remained in the shower area for 5 minutes but he would not leave so I had to walk past him)I was informed by reception that this was something that did not happen at their hotel, although it happened to me twice in 2 days and neither occasion was there a note on the door to advise men may access the area or did either man shout to inform they were in the changing area.Be prepared to model your birthday suit ladies!"
85,932,"Aug 3 2008 	Just up to Marriott Standards but wouldn't return...	I am a Marriott reward member and always try to book Marriott's when available. I frequently travel to London for weekends away, and this time decided to stay at Marriott Regents Park. I travelled with my partner, so was hoping for a relaxing but fun weekend and maybe a bit of romance! We booked tickets to see the car show at Excel and then see Kylie in Concert at the 02. We arrived Friday evening and left Sunday afternoon.Previously Marriott experiences have been very good in London, but we decided to try Regents Park as they had a decent deal of a 'Visa Olympics Package' which invovled breakfast for 2, a 100 voucher for a future weekend 2 night stay ( I have used one of these before, and it was a great deal!) and a free gift. I booked the hotel package 2 months in advance, and so far have always been lucky enough to get 'upgraded' to an executive room when I've stay at Marriott hotels, however on this occassion it was not done and i was slightly dissapointed. Our normal 'delux' room as they call them was very nice, spacious which can be unusual in London, very clean, had a nice little balcony which over looked the entrance, the normal AC, king size bed which was very very comfy and a clean (yet rather small) bathroom. Some hotel rooms can be kinda 'dark' (which for a woman, is a pain when u want to do your hair, makeup etc and your partner is in the bathroom!) but this was light and airy.The room was not very 'sound proof' and if you are a light sleeper, you may struggle with noise from people in the halls, etc. To be fair the hotel was fully booked, and there was a wedding party one night which caused a bit of extra noise late on the the hallways. Unfortunately, the hotel staff could not seem to cope with the hotel being fully booked - not enough staff to check us in or out , waiting 15 min in a queue to get breakfast at 10:15am (they say not to go during their peak hours of 9-10am so we went later!) and once seated, we noticed plenty of empty tables around us that they were slow to fill even with a queue! On a plus note, they had a man making balloon shapes for children in the restaurant over breakfast, which was a nice touch for the kids and something I have not seen a hotel do before!! The breakfast was very good thou, you didnt have to queue up at the breakfast bar once you finally got a table and there was always plenty there. Also their breakfast hours were 6-11am which was good for a weekend- allows a lie-in!  The worst thing about the hotel was the ELEVATORS! only three and you would wait ages on your floor to be taken downstairs. Everyone was complaining about it. Also although it looks nice in the photos, the pool and changing rooms were horrible. Very dirty, things broken/falling apart. In the female changing room, water was leaking from the sealing into a giant plastic container - directly over the hairdryers! I assumed they must be switched off - until I saw a young girl (only about 11 years old!) dry her hair using one! Not at all safe!!!!! The floor was covered in water missing the plastic container! I dont think this would pass a health and safety visit! During the week, the pool has adult only hours but NOT at weekends. My partner and I arrived back about 10 pm on Friday hoping for a relaxing swim in the pool, only to find it full of kids up to 11pm. Most were unsupervised, running around, screaming. The hotel assistant just ignored them. The pool was also freezing cold and didnt seem well cared for. We didnt use it again!On a plus note, the hotel is about a 2 minute walk from Swiss Cottage Tube station, and the neighbourhood is very nice and we felt safe walking late at night from the tube to the hotel. The Jubilee line allowed us direct access to the 02 arena and Excel (about 40 min journey) and also easy access (about 15 min) into town - Bond St, Victoria, etc.One guest we spoke to whilst waiting for an elevator told us that the hotel used to belong to Holiday Inn and was bought by Marriott. I'd say that it needs a lot of work to get up to the 'luxury 4* hotel' that it is advertised as... I'd say a 3 star, and not worth the 300 in total that I paid for my 2 night stay!!!!!!!!! We will not be returning!"
86,932,"Aug 2 2008 	Ideal for families	We stayed here with our 2 daughters for 2 nights from July 30th-August 1st. Room 346 which had 2 double beds which cost 280 without breakfast through Marriott's own website. Hotel is only a 5 min walk from Swiss Cottage tube ( take exit for Avenue East out of tube station, turn left walk to traffic lights, left again and you will see Marriott ahead of you by another set of traffic lights, once you cross road entrance is to the right). This hotel is ideal for families, the pool can be used from 8am-8pm with children, but if you want peace and quiet adults have sole use between 6am-8am and 8pm-11pm. The changing facilites and the overall appearance of the pool, stairs to get from changing rooms etc is definately in need of refurbishment, missing ceiling tiles, rusty pipes in ceiling and the stairs from changing rooms to pool held down with duct tape!!! and dirty. The pool, sauna and steam room are actually quite clean but the other parts mentioned do detract from it. We didn't eat here so can't comment on breakfast etc. Rooms were clean spacious and well equipped, hairdryer, trouser press, iron and ironing board, toiletries in bathroom etc all you would expect, they seem to have been recently refurbished. Lifts were the slowest we've ever encountered and several people also commented on this, waiting more than 5 mins for a lift is OTT. Convenience for getting into London was great 2 stops from Baker St for Madame Tussauds, then change here for Leicester Sq which was only another 3-4 stops and you are in the middle of London. Overall a good hotel for families who want to visit London at a reasonable price."
87,932,"Jul 22 2008 	Glad I wasn't paying	My wife and I stayed here for one night mid-week, using a Hyatt voucher redemption.The hotel is a 1970's block just off Swiss Cottage, near-ish to Regents Park and handy for some nice parts of North London.Exterior and lobby were very typical Marriott - nice enough.Check-in was a bit slow. There were no rooms available with our bed preference, strange as my wife is a Hyatt Gold member. Anyway, we got to our room and it was quite nice - fairly newly renovated, and the bathroom was also pleasant. Didn't seem the housekeeping had finished their job though. It was a bit dusty, and the minibar was not re-stocked fully. Also, a previous guest had left some sort of cold meat (salami or bacon) in the mini-bar! That was really nice, huh?! We asked someone to remove it.The 'balcony' was like something out of a sink estate tower block.Very dirty and covered in pigeon droppings. Adjacent to our balcony was a very unpleasant 'black hole' containing rubbish and old newspapers. We shut the doors and went out.Had a good night's sleep, when we awoke the bill was put under our door. As well as our room service snacks (which were OK but took 45 mins to arrive), we had been charged for the stay, even though we were using a voucher. And the room rate was 325 pounds!!! Yes, you saw it right, 325!!! For a mediocre room in the back of beyond! All was sorted OK on checkout, however after seeing that room rate I was thankful that I was not footing the bill - if so I would have done some serious complaining.So a mixed bag in all, decor and rooms are OK internally, but housekeeping and balcony were sub-standard. And the rate is really taking the mickey, but I guess that's supply and demand for you."
88,932,"Jul 5 2008 	Absolutely wonderful!	My husband and I, along with our 2 teenage daughters, just spent 6 nights in a Family Room at the London Marriott Regents Park. We had an absolutely wonderful stay there. It's close proximity to the Swiss Cottage Tube made travelling anywhere in the city very easy. There were also stores nearby the tube that we frequently used: eg. Subway, KFC, McDonalds, a drug store, a Marks and SPencer food store. The location could not have been better.Check in by a gentleman named Sanford was without incident. He was especially nice as well as were all other staff we met throughout our stay. The complimentary breakfast was just fabulous. Hot and cold. Plus a chef was there to make your own special omelet or waffle if you wished.The beds were very comfy. There were 2 large queen sized beds in our room. Computer access was available in our room even tho it came with a hefty cost....75 pounds for one week. The internet also was down for about a day and a half, but there was no problem getting a 25 pound credit for that when we checked out. I wouldn't hesitate to use the Marriott again if I went to London, which I shall surely do in the future."
89,932,"Jun 28 2008 	Good value Good location Good Stay	This hotel is in a good location, though 15 minutes walk to Regents Park. It is not in heart of London but this is relfected in its competitive prices. It is close to Swiss Cottage tube and therefore all that London has to offer is within easy reach. It is also outside the Congestion Charging Zone.Most staff were very helpful,although the check-in clerk and concierge didn't know the answer to our questions (parking and kids dining) and were unwilling to find out. This is not acceptable in a Marriott. The rooms were of a good standard and clean, although we requested a fridge and this never appeared.The pool was nice although not very big, and the access and changing rooms are badly in need of refurbishment. Also the bedrooms on the back of the hotel are on a busy road and the traffic noise meant we had to change rooms - our second room was quiet, although as it was only on the 2nd floor it did suffer with disco music from the funcation room below one night. Breakfast was of good quality and excellent selection. Didn't eat in the restaurant for dinner although the children's meals delivered via room service were good value and apart from the spaghetti dish, were of good quality. There was a lift issue during our stay and it took a while to find the stairs! This would also have been more of a problem if we were on floor 6 or 7 or of limited mobility. Parking is quite limited in the hotel although some weekend parking is available on the local streets."
90,932,"Jun 25 2008 	Fantastic hotel - really enjoyed my stay!	I stayed at the London Regents Park Marriott on a recent business trip and found the hotel superb from arrival at reception through to departure.I ate in the restaurant and I also tried the in room dining - both were of an excellent standard. Room was really nice too, modern decor and immaculately clean throughout.Location perfect, really close to Swiss Cottage tube station and they have parking too just out of the conjestion charge!I will definately stay again at this hotel."
91,932,"Jun 23 2008 	Not really Regents Park.....	We stayed at this hotel to attend an event in Regents Park.The main complaint I would have is that this hotel is nowhere near anything (including regents park), it is basically in a very residential area with very limited taxis....However ignoring the location the hotel was OK... it could be any other Marriott anywhere in the world. The bed was comfy, the room was average size (for London), the buffet breakfast was fairly well catered for...Overall, a good hotel if you do not want to be near any of Londons major attractions"
92,932,"Jun 13 2008 	A Very Good Stay..	This was our first trip to London and the location of this hotel was very important. This Marriott is on the outskirts of London, 10 mins. The tube station is Swiss Cottage that is only a 5 min walk away. When we arrived on the first day, we were able to get our room at 8am! This has never happened to us, being from the US...we arrived early from Gatwick, got to the hotel before 8am, thinking we would just leave our bags at the hotel and return later to check-in, but they had our room ready which was so great because I was so sick from my flight from NY. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and courteous in our experience.The area is very nice...quiet and has a shopping area, right across the street from the tube; has groceries stores and restaurants. The only complaint was the aroma in the lobby that was kinda musty! They need to change the scent that is circulating...try a more floral smell instead.Getting into central London is only mins away...the train system in London is commended for their promptness! Every 3 mins or less, a train is arriving. It never took long to get to the all the tourist places in central London...being from NY, wish our train system was like theirs! The only thing that was not good was it was a bit warm on the trains...no A/C. It was nice traveling with the Brits. Their TV shows is another story...boring! We spent 5 days in London, then took the Eurostar to Paris which was a nice ride (2.5 hrs)...very easy connection. The Pancreas Station is a wonderful and beautiful station and terminal. The train takes you into central Paris...then take the local train to your destination.The price we paid was about $220 per night which was a bit steep but the accomodation were very good. Overall, the Marriott did well for our first trip to London...we give it high marks!"
93,932,"Jun 2 2008 	Lovely Hotel Great location	Date = Bank holiday weekend May 24th - May 26thAges = 38,38,12 and 12We booked a family room for The wife, daughter, daughters friend and Myself. We got a great deal for 2 nights (Saturday and Sunday) of the Marriot website. We arrived in London at about 9:30am and didn`t want to waste a day. So i went to the reception and asked if it was ok to leave my car in the underground car park and come back later to check in. The man said i can do better than that, how would you like to check in now so that you can then return when you like. What a nice thing to do i thought. Thanks for that.The Room.This was larger than the normal London type hotel room. A kingsize bed and a queen size for the girls to share. Tv with the normal 1 to 5 plus sky sports, bbc news and cbbc. Mini bar (didn`t use it as with every hotel it was expensive). As usual though the mini-bar is electronically tagged so if you pick any of the bottles up, then it registers with reception and obviously they seem to think that you have purchased the item.The wardrobe was larger than normal with more hangers than normal. The wardrobe also lights up when you move one of the hangers. Nice bathroom with the usual freebies and plenty of towels. Shower in the bath was powerful. Also a large mirror with lights. We had patio windows on the 1st floor which has a mini balcony to walk out on but, don`t get too excited as it is as i say mini just enough room to walk out on and the view was the short stay car park. On Sunday we opened the door to find we had the Sunday Times left outside the door (free) although the thought was nice it`s not really my cup of tea. Talking of which, whilst relaxing after a long day walking on Saturday, Our door was knocked just as we were about to leave. It was a maid who was asking if we would like anymore bathroom freebies or coffee/tea. I thought that made a nice change. Tea/coffee facilities are available in the room.The PoolThe hotel pool although only 1.2 metres deep at the deep end was lovely and warm. The shallow end starts with steps until you reach the pool floor. The shallow end is about 8 inches deep. Obviously this gets deeper the closer you get to the deep end. Under 15`s have to be accompanied by an adult and you get a free towel to use per person. Didn`t try the steam room or the sauna around the pool edge. If adults don`t want to swim they can lounge on the cushioned sunbeds at the deep end (about 6 of them).The Hotel LobbyPlenty of room to sit and also a glass walled room where 2 people can use the internet (for a charge of course). The hotel has 3 lifts and you wont be happy using these..! They are very slow and take an awful long time to arrive. We waited 20mins the one time to come down. You`re better off going up with the lift as far as the 7th floor and then come all the way down again. If you don`t ,then the lift might be too full when it gets to your floor. This is because of all the waiting that all the other floors have had too. I can hear you saying why didn`t you use the stairs if you were only on the 1st floor. Ah.... well i asked a bellboy who was waiting with us for a lift to arrive this question. He claimed that the only stairs is the fire escape and they don`t lead to the lobby..!BreakfastThis is awesome. You can have as much as you like. There is orange juice, 6 different cereals with 2 type of milk to choose from. Toast and jam plus other different pastries. Then there is the help your self buffet english breakfast..... Streaky or non streaky bacon, sausage, beans, mushrooms, black pudding, hash browns, tomato, scrambled eggs. If you would live a fried egg as i do or an omelette, then there is a live cooking station and the chef cooks you what you like. You can order an omelette and choose what goes into it. ie ham, onion, bacon, cheese etc.The BarWe didn`t eat there but we did pull up a stool and have a drink whilst the kids used the internet room. Plenty of draught beers to choose from and a very nice peaceful atmosphere.  The areaThere are shops and banks with ATM`s by Swiss Cottage underground Station.The hotel is in a quiet residential area and about 300yards from Swiss Cottage underground station. We walked into the station on Saturday morning and asked for a travelcard for unlimeted use of the underground/buses. For the 4 of us this came to about 12.50 or so for the full day. Whilst there i purchased the same type of ticket for the Sunday too. This we found to be brilliant.The underground line is the Jubille line which goes straight to Westminster and that station is right outside Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament/Big Ben and a short walk away from The London Eye, Horse Guards and Downing Street. It takes only 12 mins to get here from Swiss Cottage and the tubes run every 3mins. The stop before Westminster is Green Park which is used for Buckingham Palace where we saw the changing of the guard. The stop before this was Bond Street and at this station you can change for Oxford Street shopping (only one station away). If you stayed on the Jubilee line tube and continued on the line past Westminster then you come to London Bridge. It takes 18 mins to get here on the tube from Swiss Cottage and you get off here for The London Dungeon, Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.We used the tube for Madame Tussauds which is the Baker Street stop and only 2 or 3 stops from Swiss Cottage. Cheap and fast way to travel or what.?All in all this was a great hotel in a great location. I find that the best way to find out if a hotel is worth going to is to ask myself would i go again. The answer is d efinately and i would look for availability at this hotel before considering anyother. I have put as much info into this review to give what i hope will help you."
94,932,Jun 2 2008 	I loved my stay!	Had great stay at the Regents Park Marriott on Saturyday! The staff was very friendly and I really loved their bed! The hotel is only 3 stops away from Bond Street which made our shopping trip really easy :)
95,932,"May 31 2008 	An all round excellent hotel.	We have just returned from an overnight stay at the London Marriott Regents Park. The hotel was fantastic and offers incredible service. The decor of all public areas and our bedroom was amazing. The hotel has just recently gone through a refurbishment and it really looks the part. The hotel is situated in a great location, just a few stops from Bond Street on the Jubilee line; and it is just outside of the Congestion Charging zone so ideal if you are driving.We stayed in one of the executive rooms. It was one of the more spacious rooms we have stayed in whilst in London; and it was 'very' clean! We dined in the hotels new French restaurant 'Central Brassiere'. A truly amazing dinner experience! The restaurant is very new and has got a great display of fine wines. We would highly recommend the King Prawns as a starter! Service in the restaurant was very attentive and personal. The restaurant is designed so that you can be seated in a private booth or in the middle of all the action!The hotel also offers an attractive bar, where we also met some famous cricket players!!!Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in when visiting and shopping in Central London; and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking to stay in the Capital."
96,932,"May 30 2008 	must go to this hotel!!!!!	where to start?we arrived at around half 1 in the afternoon and we were shown straight to our room. ever one we passed and came into contact with were so friendly and so eager to help you. the rooms where spotless and beautiful, very spacious and comfy, especially the beds. We ate in the restaurant and whoever goes there MUST try the chocolate mousse, its the most amazing thing i have ever tasted!! how ever the food was a little slow to get to us but they were more than happy to apologise. Over all the restaurant and bar are very comfy and i felt like i could sit there all night without having to worry about trying to catch anyones attention as they were so happy to help and did not choose to ignore you like so many other places. Another thing that is great about this hotel is that it is so easy to access every where, it is so close to the station."
97,932,"May 29 2008 	Excellent Hotel	we stayed at the Marriott Regents Park in May 08. A very friendly and welcoming hotel with the staff keen to please. The bedroom was very clean and the bed very comfortable. There is a great bar and a smart but relaxed newly refurbished restaurant - food was great and excellent service. We found it really handy to get into the West End for a show and restaurants also - swiss Cottage tube is only a few minutes walk away or pretty quick by cab. Really good value for money and ideal for London sightseeing.Mark, Edinburgh"
98,932,"May 28 2008 	Not up to Marriott's usual standard Nice beds	The Marriott London Regents Park was a little bit of a disappointment. It wasn't terrible in any way, just not as nice as Marriotts we have used in the USA and London (Marriott London Park Place is much better).The rooms are fairly nice and the beds are very comfortable and overall the hotel was pretty quiet although not soundproofed by any means. We could hear traffic and doors slamming in the hallway, etc.There were a couple of issues. The worst was when a hotel-wide fire alarm rang out VERY loudly at 2am for about 30 seconds, waking us and my elderly parents in the next room (and presumably everyone in the hotel and possibly in the neighborhood!) We were disoriented and freaked out. It took about a hour to fall back asleep and we already were jet-lagged having just arrived a few hours before from Los Angeles. There was no fire, it was an error or some sort. Anyway, this sort of thing is random and likely won't happen when you're staying there (I hope!) I do feel that they should have handled it better and maybe comped breakfast for everyone or taken $20 off or something. It was a pretty big upset.The service here was not that great and the bar/restaurant service was very bad. People all around us were canceling their orders due to the food taking so long, etc.The location is pretty close to a Tube station (Swiss Cottage) but obviously not central to the sights. There are a couple restaurants in walking distance and an M&amp;S Simply Food and a couple shops in 5 minutes walk.Overall, I would consider staying here again if it were quite a bit cheaper than other similar options. We paid about $220/night per room in US dollars with all taxes and fees. Internet in the room or lobby is not free (in fact it is very expensive). I would consider a stay here again for $150/night I think."
99,932,"May 27 2008	A great stay (mostly)	Stayed 2 nights on a Priceline bid. Arrived at 1:30 pm and room wasn't ready, the desk said to come back at 3:00 pm. Went to the bar and had a drink and waited along with many others who were also waiting for their rooms. At 3:00 went back to desk. Room still not ready (the Priceline curse of worst room, worst service?) but this desk clerk finally told me he was placing me in an upgraded room on the 6th Floor (minus the executive suite access). It was nice room, regular Marriott amenities, good bed, and a small balcony. Somewhat loud at night considering it was the sixth floor. Traffic noise was constant all night. I liked the Swiss Cottage area, and it was easy to get around, walking or using the tube and busses. Used the free wifi internet at McDonald's on Finchley Rd rather than pay the 15 pounds the Marriott wanted. Also shopped at the Marks and Spencer Food Store just across from the tube stop, much less expensive than the hotel's restaurant. Stored my food in my room's mini fridge. A highlight of the stay for me was watching a play at Hampstead Theatre which is adjacent to the Swiss Cottage tube stop. Saw an amazing play with a great seat, &quot;Stockholm&quot; for 20 pounds. Bought a wonderful fresh-made crepe from the little French cheese stand at the entrance to the theatre and 2 fantastic cookies from the bakery stand next to it, then enjoyed my picnic dinner on the deck of the theatre overlooking the community park and fountain. Inexpensive alternative to the traditional West End evenings out, and all within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. Theatre bar also served sandwiches and drinks.Rode the bus to Warwick Street and caught the London Waterbus canal tour boat to Camden Locks. That was fun, 50 minute boat ride, and only 6 pounds 50. Easy bus ride back to the hotel. My only meal in the cafe at the hotel was not that good, and service was slow, the servers inattentive, and the bill added wrong. Checked out very early (5:30 am) for flight from Heathrow. Bill was totally wrong as I was a Priceline customer so I was prepaid, and there was someone else's rather large bar tab on the bill that I refused to pay. With no tube service available that early on a Sunday, I booked my ride to Heathrow with Swiss Cottage cars, less than 30 pounds, a very good deal, I think. Driver was right on time, will definitely use their service again. Overall, I really liked the hotel room, the amenities and the location. The staff were the weak link of the stay."
100,932,"May 12 2008 	Excellent Hotel	We a family of 4 have just returned from a weekend at the London Marriott hotel Regents park . The hotel is excellent and in all the hotels we have stayed in both Ireland &amp; England we have never experienced such incrediable service and value for money. Would have no problem recommending this hotel to others and will definately return ourselves. The reception staff and concierge were very friendly and were only too glad to help in everyway. The pool was small, not hugh but adequate for us.Very convenient to London Zoo or travelling around London city as the tube station (Swiss Cottage) is only a short walk away on the Jubilee line which links all parts of London. Food excellent and breakfast brillant, more than enough to eat."
101,932,"May 5 2008 	Fab hotel	My husband and I staid here for a long weekend break with our 2 children using our tesco vouchers. We had a wonderful time and were very impressed with the hotel even though there were reefurbishments taking place.Our room on the second floor was huge and very clean, the bed was very comfy and there was ample space for the four of us. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries and re stocked every day even with mouthwash!The breakfast was very nice with a wide selection of hot and cold dishes and pancakes and waffles were made fresh in front of you. We did not have to wait long for a table even at the weekend, and we breakfasted at about 9 ish. The swimming pool was a huge hit with our children and open quite late. The hotel is situated very near Swiss Cottage Tube Station, on the jubilee line so only took about 10mins into central london.The only negative comment about the hotel was the lifts were very slow and the only walking downstairs was using a fire escape and walking through a kitchen area. This may resolve with the refurbishment programme.Would recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
102,932,"Apr 21 2008 	Great beds	Very nice clean room, and a good size. The room is also very quiet. A nice pool, except the changing rooms are far away from the pool and you get quite cold on the walk to the pool (so bring a towel to wrap around you for the walk). The breakfast was very nice but very expensive. It is a 3 minute walk from Swiss Cottage tube station. For someone who likes walking to their room it is not good because there are no public stairs; you have to use the lift. The room was a good size (for London). It is not very central but London's public transport is very fast so it doesn't really matter."
103,932,"Mar 17 2008 	Reasonable for the right price	I got a great deal on this place via Priceline. I definitely would not pay normal rates to stay here, especially with the weakness of the US dollar. But I would stay there again if I can get it for the same price via Priceline.The Zone 2 Tube stop is 2-3 blocks away, so it's a reasonable place to stay for tourists. The Tube itself is quite fast and efficient. There is a small market between the tube station and the hotel. A larger supermarket is within walking distance (5 blocks?)The hotel feels a bit dated for a Marriott, and the inner views aren't great. But the room is nice and clean and we didn't have any noise issues.Oh, and despite the name, it's no where near Regents Park."
104,932,"Mar 4 2008	Sleep deprived at the Marriott	Don't stay here if you like to sleep. They allow music to blast out of the banquet hall on the ground floor, and then their suppliers pack up their lorries outside your window until after 1 a.m.. Then the delivery trucks start to arrive again at 6 a.m.. The duty manager didn't seem to care, apparently the hotel guests aren't as important as the drunk party-goers."
105,932,"Feb 9 2008 	Decent Hotel with Fair rates (for London)	This hotel is a good place to stay for a reasonable price, as long as you are willing to take public transportation to get around. The Regent's Park area is far from the city center. The Swiss Cottage Tube stop is a 5 minute walk from the hotel and there are several bus lines around the area as well (#82, #13). I paid 118 pounds for a week day room (about $240), which for London on business travel is a good deal. The hotel looks dated from the outside and is undergoing renovations and the rooms are updated. It's in a suburban like setting, although close enough to major roads to hear the traffic at night. Although the name suggests it is close to Regent's Park, it is not. However there is a large park a few minutes away, with a great view of the city. Take time to go for a walk. The room was clean, bed comfortable, bathroom a typical old Marriott small bathroom. Good shower. Tea pot in the room (no coffee pot but that's typical of UK). The rooms were noisy in the morning due to the banging doors. Other than that, the rooms were quiet save for some traffic noise that is to be expected in a large city. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The Concierge staff went out of the way to help me with directions. Since I stayed there for a week, I was constantly asking for their help. The food in the hotel is expensive and few were eating there. Within walking distance at night there are few restaurants. (Stay away from the Swiss Cottage unless all you want is a beer.) But there are several trendy restaurants on the other side of the park.The pool was warm enough but more geared towards kids with the beach type entrance, which made swimming laps difficult. Changing rooms are a chilly walk to the pool. There is a steam room and sauna, as well as what looked like an excellent work out facility. I can recommend this hotel if you want a basic, safe, clean place to stay."
106,932,"Jan 30 2008 	Avoid the restaurant / food	The hotel is nowhere near Regents Pk (why do hotel chains do this?) &amp; was in the middle of renovation work so the restaurant wasn't open &amp; we had to eat in the cafe area. Wish they'd told us when we booked. The restaurant service &amp; food were seriously awful (warm mineral water, inedibly greasy pasta, soggy/greasy salad, soggy pastry, etc) and other diners were unhappy too. Staff were very nice but inept, we waited 1/2 hour to be served then another 1/2 hour for food, the water &amp; wine arrived after our first course. Nothing was done when I didn't eat my meal &amp; told them why, they just apologised &amp; smiled.... However, the room (deluxe) was lovely, comfortable &amp; very quiet, breakfast was excellent &amp; staff very friendly. We would stay again but definitely not eat there."
107,932,"Jan 29 2008	loved this place	I wasn't sure of this location but it proved to be very close to the tube &amp; a short walk to Camden market. I was upgraded to a 7th floor room with a king &amp; a solarium type window that was very comfortable, spacious and a awesome deal for the money considering I booked it on priceline for 117 us.The only problem was the internet was very expensive &amp; only available for 24 hr blocks. Very helpfull attentive staff that went out of their way. A few good Indian places near by and a decent pub."
108,932,"Jan 28 2008	loud and dated	The room was very nice, but outside the room was dated. The hotel is evidently going through a major renovation ending sometime next year.Also, the room was very loud. I could hear traffic all night long and I was on the 5th floor."
109,932,"Jan 19 2008 	Good hotel for LON	I stayed there while attending a conference. Although the hotel is under renovation, it's very good place to stay at for London. While it is not ideally located on the Jubille line, it's in fact very calm and pleasant area. Rooms are very clean and new, still smell like new carpet. Bed was probably the best one I've ever slept in for a hotel. Did not need earplugs, hotel was silent enough. Comfort of the room was ideal."
110,932,"Jan 17 2008 	Superb hotel clean friendly well positioned recommended!	My family and I were staying in London for a weekend, and chose to stay at the Marriot Hotel Regents Park. We booked a family room for 4 people.Swiss Cottage is the nearest Underground station, and the hotel is about 300 yards from there, although it means crossing a busy road.The hotel itself is very well presented and cared for. The reception is large and impressively decorated - standard Marriot - and the checkin staff were friendly and very efficient.The room itself was fabulous - two large double beds, table and chairs, a lovely big clean bathroom, and double doors that opened on to our own balcony! We could easily see St.Pauls, the London Eye, the Gherkin (!) and the BT Tower from it. If we had one criticism of the room, it was that the television was rather small, especially when compared to other Marriots I have stayed at.We made use of the swimming pool attached to the hotel, which was a little disappointing. The changing rooms were good, but you have to walk about 50 yards from them to the pool, along cold corridors - not much fun when you are coming back. The pool itself is very good for small children, as it is only about 6 inches deep at one end. There was also a very good sauna and steam room.We were going to eatin the hotel restaurant, but were horrified at the prices - to feed four of us would have cost almost as much as the hotel room! In the end we walked back into Camden (approx 500 yards) and found various cafes and take aways. Much better value!Breakfast the next day was included in the price, and consisted of a fabulous buffet - cereals, fruit, cakes, meats and bread - as well as a cooked breakfast.Checkout was fast and efficient, and no problems with the bill ;)On the whole this was a terrific hotel, really enjoyable. If Marriot could only sort out the ridiculous prices they charge for food in their bars and restaurants, it would be perfect."
111,932,"Dec 15 2007 	Not as inconvenient as it looks	I was a bit ticked to get this via Priceline, as it looked to be quite far from anything, and longish walk to the Tube. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my stay, and for what I paid ($130 a night, incl. tax), very happy.Despite the name, the hotel is of course not remotely close to Regent's Park, but once you get past that, it's in quite a good spot. The bus right outside the hotel goes straight to Camden Market, giving you lots of shopping/dining opportunities. And the Tube isn't really that far -- more like 3 minutes walk, it's just sort of confusing to find it the first time. (Hint: Take the &quot;Avenue&quot; exit from the Swiss Cottage stop, then, with the actual Swiss Cottage pub facing you, turn left and walk to the corner, then turn left again and you'll see the Marriott sign a block or so in front of you.) And while Swiss Cottage seemed a bit far out on the Tube map, the frequent and fast service meant it never took me longer than 15-20 minutes to get anywhere in central London. Another less obvious bonus of the location is the Swiss Cottage Library and Leisure Centre (the massive complex w/ the rock climbing wall), which is halfway between the Tube and the hotel. There's a great casual restaurant there for breakfast and lunch, far cheaper than the hotel, and you can get up to 1 hour free Internet access a day at the library (just go up to the 2nd floor Learning Centre and sign in).The hotel itself is fine -- standard 4-star chain hotel, comfortable beds, electric tea kettle, etc. Service is a bit erratic, as it usually is in this kind of place -- I wouldn't bother asking the &quot;concierge&quot; for anything -- but not in a way that's really going to faze you if you travel a lot."
112,932,"Nov 10 2007 	An excellent experience	I spent two nights at this hotel in Nov 07. I thought the hotel was excellent.The room was of a good size with two double beds contained within it.The bed was extremely comfortable with very clean and crisp linen.I only had one slight problem, and that was with the TV that seemed to have a mind of its own from time to time.The staff in the hotel were very welcoming and knowledgeable.The food in the restaurant was very good, although the hash browns were a little chewy.I used the high speed wireless internet connection which was adequately fast, although 15 for 24 hours, a little expensive. Isn't it about time hotels offered this service as part of your stay with them, instead of further cashing in on business users??For a stay in London, the hotel is a little too far out of the city centre, but with only a 5 min walk to Swiss Cottage Tube station you are about 10-15mins tube ride away.Primrose Hill is about a 5 min stroll away from the hotel and is a great walk and a rewarding view once you get there.I would recommend the hotel and have no doubts about staying again."
113,932,"Nov 7 2007 	OK Facility; Inconvenient Location	Enjoyed a good size king room in October 2007. Although it has been a while since the room had been renovated, the furnishing and equipment were still in good condition. The bath was a little on the small size but was acceptable. The front desk was always busy. The clerks were plesant but not very efficient and the computer system was frequently &quot;down&quot;The concierage was absolutely magnificant. Extremely helpful and cheerful.The quality of the food in the resturant was good although they frequently ran out of items. Service was slow and highly inefficient.The hotel is located about a mile northwest of Regents Park. It is just a five minute walk to the Swiss Cottage stop on the Jubilee underground line with door to door trips to central London taking about 45 minutes. Taxi fares to central London ran between 16 and 19 GBP.I would consider staying here on a return trip but would first explore other hotels closer to central London."
114,932,"Oct 30 2007 	Nice stay	Stayed three nights using points. Nice room with good beds. New bathroom, crisp white linens, and mini fridge. Great location as Swiss Cottage station is around the corner and is easy to get everywhere. Only complaint was the room was very stuffy even with the A/C on. Actually I don't think the A/C was working, but I've never stayed in a hotel in the UK where the A/C actually cooled, so this was no different. It was Oct. so we were able to open the sliding door to the tiny balcony to get some fresh air. There is no room for furniture on the balcony but you can stand on it. There is a good indoor pool, sauna, and steam room. Check in was easy and they even allowed us into the room early. Only ate at the hotel for breakfast one day and they ran out of eggs at 9:15am. They have one computer in the lobby for guest use and a 45 minute internet card was 7 GBP. There was always a line to use it however. Some good restaurants in Primrose Hill which is about a 10 minute walk. Benihana was good and around the corner from the hotel, but very expensive. Regular courses are between 23-36 GBP. We got the seven course deal for 16.50 GBP which was the cheapest thing but good. Maybe it just seemed expensive as the USD is so weak there now. All in all a nice safe place to stay as long as you're okay with being a little north of the main city."
115,932,"Sep 23 2007 	Marriott Regent's Park	We spend 3 nights at the Marriott Regent Park in London at the end of our England trip. It was kind of nice to be in an upscale hotel after a week of traveling. The Marriott Regent Park is located on a busy road in London's Zone Two in a residential neighborhood. We had a room facing the road and there was some road noise. It was very easy and quick to get to the central London tourist spots via the underground. The hotel is a 7-minute walk from the Swiss Cottage Tube Station. The interior of the hotel has just recently been totally renovated. Our room was very pretty, bed was comfortable, and the hotel was exceptionally clean. There is a swimming pool and a well-equipped gym located in the hotel. There was a computer in the lobby where you could get into your airline web site to check in for your return flight. In my experience this is usually a complementary service at most hotels. My only grip was that the computer let you get into the website and start your check-in and than before you finished you had to put your credit card information and pay 3 pounds. If the hotel is going to charge for this service, it needs to be more upfront and require your credit card information prior to getting on the airlines website. We did enjoy our stay at this hotel and even slept in a couple of mornings."
116,932,"Sep 16 2007	Excellent American Style Hotel in London	I had an excellent stay at the Marriott Regents Park. The room was spacious compared to other European hotels. A short work to the underground (multiple restaurants) and a 24 market. The staff was always helpful. One weird thing was they did not provide conditioner in the room (had to ask for it). The internet costs was prohibitive (15 pounds). I read other reviews and ask for the quiet side of the hotel (it was very quiet). I prefer staying out of the downtown area. We took the direct train to Westminister (20 minutes). We are on a barge overlooking the review. Also, the hop on and off bus included a free cruise to Greenwich (scenic 8 mile tour of river). Primrose Hill is a short walk. It not close to Regents Park, take the underground. The bus on the corner to us to Camden market in 5 minutes (best shopping in london - 3rd highly visited tourist site). I did not eat in the hotel because the nearby restaurants were half the price and good. We also enjoyed the free pool and sauna at night."
117,932,Sep 13 2007 	Excellent Service	Loved this place! The meal in their restaurant was the best we tasted in our entire stay in London. Very delicious and the service was excellent. The bed and pillows in the room were very comfortable and everything was very well provided. It is close to the Swiss Cottage Tube Station so getting around is very easy.The cost was a bit pricey with the currency conversion from pounds to dollars but it was well worth it. I would stay here again the next time I am in London.
118,932,Sep 7 2007 	Not a good Choice	Our family made the wrong choice by staying at this Hotel. It's very noisy as it's facing the street where you can hear the traffic. Especially the noise from noisy diesel engine london black Taxi's running up and down the street to and from the hotel all night long till early hours in the morning.
119,932,"Sep 4 2007 	4 Star Comfort-Priceline Value	Wow ! What a value. We paid $535 for two rooms for two nights via Priceline in August. Marriott recognized my Platinum status and gave us two rooms on the Executive floor.Comfy beds, attractive lobby. Check-in was lengthy, why ?Could be the trainee's referred to on an earlier post.Hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from a tube station.It is a little out of town (10-15 minutes from Bond st /Victoria Station via tube).However, we received excellent treatment and value."
120,932,"Sep 2 2007 	dont stay here!!!	My Family and i stayed here for one night and it was awful , after checking in we went up to our room and it had not be cleaned from the last person ,the ashtray was full of cigarette ends, and the room smelt horrible,we were told when we checked in there were no other family rooms, only smoking, when we complain about our room they changed us to a no smoking room ,but it was right on the road side ,which for a famliy room was a bit silly. so after a sleepless night,we went down to breakfast to a buffet style there was no fruit on offer for my daughter,we had the english breakfast which was just warm, and the toaster (which there was only one)took forever so we gave up on that idea. overall i would give this hotel a miss 0/10."
121,932,"Aug 31 2007 	Expected much more !!	This was our third stay at this hotel. We decided to go although there was a soft refurbishing going on as I expected they would eventually have fixed all the minor faults I had noticed the last time I was there.  After two very long check- ins (first time room was not ready so we had to go thru check in again) we were given a newly refurbished luxury room but:1 the room was half the size of the old rooms with very low ceiling;2 wall to wall carpeting had just been laid but not secured so corners were falling down;3 TV set went on mysteriously during the night;4 called housekeeping for an extra suitcase rack but nobody answered; called front desk and after a long wait we were told they had none available and suggested we place the suitcases on the floor!5 Handle on window was kept in place with duct tape and there was no way of securing the window so it was unlocked all the time;6 Part of the latch on the door was missing thus door was locked only with double lock 7 The drain in the tub didnt work and the shower hose leaked spraying water all over the tiny bathroom!Went down and asked to talk to manager (blond men with crew cut) and reported all the above; he was very abrupt if not rude and said he would send crew following morning at eight (!!) Never seen anybody in the days we were there and shower was always a problem.Breakfast was OK although breakfast room quite crowded over the weekendI have to say to be correct that our room was kept clean, had good mattresses and good pillow selection. Very good location, it could be a very nice hotel if not for the very poor maintenance and useless housekeeping! Doesnt really look refurbished, more like they just painted it white and downsized the rooms!! If you do not mind size of room and could care less about details its OK"
122,932,"Aug 25 2007	Great family hotel	This recently refurbished hotel was great for our family of 5. Although many consider it outside of the city center, it is very easy to get to anywhere from Swiss Cottage tube station which is right around the corner. The room cleaning was a little bit lame, as they kept leaving items in our room such as cleaning clothes and other cleaning items. We got a great rate for a London hotel direct from the Marriott web page, which included breakfast. Breakfast was always busy (especially if you arrive late) but there was always plenty of food and the service was good too. We stayed for 9 nights, there are no washing machine facilites in the hotel, so this can be inconvenient for people who are staying for a long trip. We did not see any nearby and the hotel charges for washing were very expensive around $10 for a pair of socks! I see a lot of people complaining about additional charges but our bill came to exactly the same amount quoted from the internet."
123,932,"Aug 25 2007 	So nice!!	We stayed here from the 16th through the 22nd. They had just remodeled the hotel so we got the most wonderful room on the 5th floor. It was very, very nice and clean. All the rooms have little balconies and air condition. The only thing that bothered us was that in the restaurants, the staff wasn't very friendly, it was very expensive and it took awhile to get our food. Just breakfast was $80 for me, my husband and daughter. It was a little cheaper to order room service than to go downstairs. There was a breakfast buffet every morning with all kinds of stuff on it. So it was great to get a good meal in before heading out for the day. Theres nothing really close by so we ended up eating at least once a day in the restaurant because it was so much easier. We went to Wagamama a couple of nights and if you love noodles, you will love it! Everything is unbelievably expensive everywhere, but this place is not too bad and really worth it. We really loved this hotel because it was sort of out of the busy hustle and quiet. The Swiss Cottage Tube is right around the corner also. If we go back we would definitely stay here again!"
124,932,Aug 25 2007	Really Nice Hotel	Really what you would expect from a Marriott - large clean and comfortable rooms and lovely retaurant and bar area.The staff were really accommodating and the food in the restaurant was great and very reasonably priced. We ate from the 3 course menu which was 25 and included a glass of wine (always a great selling point!!)The bedrooms have just been refurbished and are really modern and airy - the only one thing I would suggest is to provide propoer haidryers in the rooms! The beds live up to the Marriott standard - they are so comfy that you never want to get out of them!!!Locationwise it's great too- only a couple of stops on the tube to Bond Street and a twenty minute walk to Camden!So a big thumbs up for this hotel - will definately be returning!
125,932,"Aug 16 2007	A good experience	Stayed here for 1 night in Aug 2007. Had an excellent room on the second floor in a quiet part of the hotel which had an extremely comfortable bed, good sitting area, functioning air con and an excellent bathroom. Breakfast was one of the best expreienced in a hotel of this type and service and facilities were genrally good (apart from somewhat slow reception staff) The only complaint was with regards to the poor quality of food served in the evening. The &quot;prime cut beef&quot; burger had clearly arrived straight from the factory via the freezer and the tiny portion of Caesar salad was made with the very bitter inner leaves of the lettuce. Not good. However, there are plenty of local options to eat out in Swiss Cottage, St Johns Wood High Street and Regents Park Road in Primrose Hill. Would stay here again."
126,932,"Aug 3 2007 	Great hotel in London	Me and my husband stayed for 3 nights at the Marriott Regents Park. It was a treat for my Birthday and also an opportunity for my husband to watch the start of the Tour De France. The hotel was in a good location - close to the centre of everything but not too close - the surrounding area wasn't too busy or noisy.We checked in around 1pm (had requested early check-in) and the staff were helpful and friendly.Our room was on the executive floor and it was lovely and spacious with a lovely bathroom, very comfortable bed and a nice balcony where we could watch the world go by. As we were on the executive floor we also had access to the executive lounge which provided free snacks and soft drinks.Breakfast was included in our package and was a typical buffet breakfast - the food was tasty and fresh and the staff were very efficient. We had room service a couple of times and found the service quick, food was delicious and not overly expensive by London standards.Unfortunately we didn't get chance to try the hotel bar because we were so busy every day.The only down side to this hotel was the cost of parking - it cost us nearly 70 to park our car for around 36 hours.All in all though it was a lovely stay in London and I would definately recommend this hotel."
127,932,"Jul 19 2007 	Rooms were hot as hell - avoid until air conditioning fixed	I use this hotel a lot for business travel and have always enjoyed the quality of the hotel and the very professional staff. But this time when I booked no reference to the failed air conditioning was mentioned neither at the booking nor the check-in stage 2 days later nor again in the room.It was horribly warm all night and all the staff could do was offer a fan. On objecting it seems the hotel have decided not to inform guests but simply remove 'air conditioning' from the description on their website. However, how can a hotel clasify itself as luxurious if it cannot offer the basics of London's three star hotels; &quot;luxury bedding with custom comforters, thicker mattresses, fluffier pillows&quot; are no substitute.This is an unworthy approach by senior management to an understandable problem which leaves the Marriott's customer-facing staff in a very difficult position. The deliberate lack of information damages customer loyalty and Marriott should know better!!!!! Poor show."
128,932,"Jul 17 2007	not going back	This is a fancy hotel with some good service and some terrible service. Good service included the bellmen and concierge (very friendly). However, the guest services department you reach by dialing 0 from your room is useless. They are not knowledgeable about services, are curt and unprofessional, and rush you as they have another phone ringing loudly in the background. The front desk staff is ok, but nothing special. Both the website and the desk staff neglected to inform us that the air conditioning was not working and we were hot and sweaty every night. The kitchen closes at 11pm, right when hungry theatre-goers are returning to their rooms. If you're one of these, your only choice of food is a cold sandwich which is highly overpriced and takes forever to be delivered.I worked for Marriott for several years so I can say with certainty that this property is not up to scratch by Marriott standards."
129,932,"Jul 9 2007	Not perfect but pretty good	We stayed at the hotel as part of a wedding. The pros: Great location, close to tube, lovely Primrose Hill and the fabulous Regent's park. Pretty good gym and a large pool (for an urban hotel anyway). The room was large, clean and very comfortable. Good breakfast which was included in the room rate. Very friendly staff. The cons: there was no air conditioning because of renovations and the rooms were sleep-disturbingly hot. Obviously temporary. Access to the pool was a bit strange, looked like it was part of the renovations too. The spa is also being renovated; I was very happy to get a pedicure there but it was very cramped. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The location is great as long as you are happy not being in dead-centre London. I found this to be a bonus though -- because it is near the parks and has the large pool it is also very relaxing."
130,932,"Jul 5 2007 	Marriott Member Benefits	We stayed for 3 nights at the end of June. The main parts of the hotel and at least 20 of the rooms have just been renovated. When booking, ask for a renovated room as they looked much nicer than the older rooms. Since we are Marriott Gold members we were given a room on the 6th floor executive level, which has all newly renovated rooms. The new rooms are great and included robes, slippers, mini bar, and very large bath sheets. If you're a Marriott member, the members only lounge has free wi-fi and access to a computer. Members also get free breakfast and free happy hour snacks. Non-alcoholic beverages are available for free all day. If you use marriott points to stay here, it cost us 55,000 points for 2 nights. That's a lot of points but hotels in London are very expensive.The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk of the Swiss Cottage tube station in a relatively quiet area of the city. The hotel is apparently good enough for celebrities as some members of England's cricket team were staying there, causing quite a bit of excitement for some of the guests who lined up to get Monty Panesar's autograph."
131,932,"Jun 26 2007 	Very nice London hotel at a reasonable price	We stayed here for three days. The rooms are very nice, large, clean, and well appointed. The beds are dreamily comfortable. The staff were attentive, friendly and professional. The renovations have shut the air-conditioning off, so it was a little warm in the room, but we kept our sliding door open, so it was very nice and cool in the evening. The hotel staff will supply a fan if you want it. Part of the hotel is under-renovation, so we heard a little noise, but we paid a great price for the rooms in a London hotel of this stature. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Swiss Cottage underground. From there a zone 1 and 2 pass will take you virtually anywhere in London. So adjust for the temperature, and a little noise in the day, and enjoy this lovely hotel while it is discounted.  We were very pleased with our stay."
132,932,"Jun 5 2007 	Fine 3.5 stars rather than the advertised 4 stars	Booked this hotel through Priceline for $125 a night (2 nights). Was disappointed to see that part of the property was under renovation. Finally got PL to contact the hotel and we were promised a room that would not be affected by noise.Checked in and we were given a corner room on the 3rd floor. Room was very spacious, bright and well equipped. Corridoor was quiet.Bathroom was a decent size though the bath was small. Only thing the bathroom was lacking was a magnifying mirror - pretty standard issue for &quot;4 star&quot; hotels, and vital for those of us who need to prettify without our glasses on!Three big let downs from the room:1 - the air conditioning did not work properly. We didn't need it the first night, the second night we returned late to a humid room. Stuck the air con on at the lowest setting and the room got warmer not colder. It was too late at that point to contact maintenance.2 - room was over the banquet hall. Not much fun when the wedding party broke up at 3am, the did not depart quietly and this disturbed our sleep greatly.3 - the plastic matress protector!! This was the most offensive thing about the room. I understand that hotels want to get the maximum life from their mattresses but I woke up at 2am the first night feeling sweaty and uncomfortable. Suspected it may be the bed, removal of the lower sheet revealed a mattress protector with a plastic lining. No wonder my back was clammy! This is unacceptable practice in a 4 star hotel in my opinion, there are plenty of &quot;breathable&quot; alternatives.Didn't eat in the hotel, plenty of affordable options within 5 mins of the hotel and beyond. The area felt safe and the tube station was less than 5 mins walk away.Overall this hotel was fine, just not deserving of a 4 star rating."
133,932,"May 21 2007 	Comfortable and Friendly	We stayed here for three days, and were very impressed with the staff. They were friendly and professional. The rooms were large, clean, and well appointed. The hotel is about a three minute walk from the Swiss Cottage underground, which is very convenient to everything you might want to see in the city.We loved the bed, the newly renovated bathrooms. We were especially impressed with the friendly and helpful staff. The neighbourhood was quiet and had relatively easy access to the underground and a bus service (leading to downtown spots) just outside the door.We were very pleased with our stay."
134,932,"May 4 2007 	It's fine	We stayed here in March. Yes, all the reviews that mention the hotel are undergoing renovations are correct. Other than the display in the lobby and signs indicating the other wing of the hotel was closed we never would have known. There was no noise, dust, or problems. Our room was one that had been renovated and it was nice, clean, and pretty large by London standards. Web connectivity was really expensive (12 GBP a day, I think). Breakfast in the hotel is also very expensive for a pretty basic spread. We used the pool, too, which was fun.The location is great if you want to be in the northwest, but it isn't in the heart of the hubbub. We had lived in Belsize Park, so this location was great for us. It's very close to the Swiss Cottage tube stop (Jubilee Line), so you can get anywhere. It is also walkable to Regents Park and Primrose Hill, which is a plus.In the end, it's a Marriott, so it feels pretty much like any other Marriott you've stayed in before."
135,932,"May 2 2007	Great hotel	We stayed at the Regents Park Marriott a few weeks back and were lucky enough to experience one of the brand new bedrooms which was absolutely gorgeous! And it just got better, we went out in Camden for a few drinks, so the location was perfect - (its just a 5 min bus ride away), when we got back the bar was still open and had some lovely cocktails, followed by the best nights sleep i have had in a while!!Breakfast was fab - all you eat buffet, and to be honest i am not usually a fan of these as the food sits for hours - but this was really tasty - they even made me some waffles while i waited!! All round top experience - would most definately stay again!!"
136,932,"Apr 27 2007 	Good stay	Let me start by saying that my career causes me to travel and so I have stayed at many Marriotts throuout the world (many time gold member). This is a decent Marriott. Large room for a European Hotel. They offer American electrical outlets. Service was great. Food could have been better. I would walk up the street to one of the pubs or go grab a curry nearby. Fitness facility was good. The pool was real good. It is a short walk to the underground (Swiss Cottage station). My room was on the quiet street side. My colleagues were on the side facing the main street. They complained of the noise at night. But, then again, they are from small town America and are not use to that sort of thing. If that sort of thing bothers you, just ask for a room on the right side of the hotel.The next time I am in London, I will try to stay here."
137,932,"Apr 2 2007 	Nice room large pool	Stayed for 2 nights in one of the old rooms. Hotel is currently being refurbised and it was a little noisy in the day time. Room still very good and lots of space. Large pool, good for children as it's shallow at one end. Food generally not that impressive."
138,932,"Mar 30 2007 	Good price-Good service. Location---ehh.	I went there by myself to get away for 5 days and watch a Super Bowl, LIVE in London at 11:30 PM. Something is unique about that--plus, it's a good time to get away. No crowds, low price airfare, half empty plane...etc.I picked the Regents Park hotel because of the pool...and I like Marriott's.The hotel itself was nice. Concierge had an opera ticket ready for me on arrival..(as I requested). The staff was helpful. The rooms were nice and the beds were EXCELLENT!..(that is fast becoming a Marriott trademark).The free breakfast..(with the package), was fantastic.The only problems were...the tube is about a 10/15 minute walk to get to and there's not too much around the area itself.The pool was small...but that really wasn't the problem with the pool. There is a NOT SO gradual incline/decline in the pool. It goes from about 1 ft in the beginning to 5 ft at the other end. If you move to halfway in the pool---it's only up to the middle of your thighs...lol.The food selection is sub-par, (excluding breakfast). I got a cheeseburger from room service there one night...and although it was fine--that was the only thing on the menu that seemed like a nice choice.And lastly---the bar is sooo small and sort of uncomfortable.There was an annoying guy there for the Steelers/Seahawks SB that was trying to &quot;shushh&quot; people so he could hear the pregame entertainment...lol. But the proximity of everything was so close that I guess he felt he had to do that. LOL---only a rude American would ask a bar to be quiet for something like that.But still---the bar area is small.One side note---something good and bad at the same time. I loved that all the rooms have balconies---but all the balconies are so small you can't even put a chair out there. Was ok that time since it was Feb. But if I came in the summer and knew they had balconies---I'd have thought I could sit out there and watch the world go by. You can still watch the world go by---but...lol---you'll have to do it standing.Overall---I liked my stay a lot.I'd recommend this hotel if you don't mind not really being in London.Ren"
139,932,Mar 10 2007 	Weekend In London	I visited London with a group of friends last weekend. We flew direct to Luton from Alicante. It was really easy to get to the hotel via the M1. The hotel is currently being updated and we stayed in one of the brand new rooms with two double beds. The room looked very modern and each room had it's own balcony. The beds were the comfiest I've ever slept in with matress toppers you sink into. Breakfast was fantastic although very busy as it was the weekend. We were told that during the week and earlier in the mornings the restaurants were less crowded. We had to wait for a few minutes to get a table but the food and service were excellent and soon made me forget the wait. The underground station was a few minutes walk away and could easily access any part of the city pretty much whenever we wanted. My friends and I would recomend this hotel to anyone visiting London as we found it to be great value for money and the staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful.
140,932,"Mar 10 2007 	Love the new rooms!	I stayed at the Regents Park Marriott and can not fault it. It's ideal for the business traveler, close to the centre (only 2 stops to bond street) and not the Park Lane price tag. Service can alway be better, but it's what you would expect, the waiting time in the morning at the reception desk is long, but hey you can always do the video check out or the express check out, which I did. Then on to the rooms, they are undergoing a light refurbishment, and I was there for 5 nights, and can really say it didnt bother me at all, I was lucky to get one of the new rooms and they look really nice. Bit more trendy, more 2007 then 1990's but not too try hard.Would recommend this hotel to anyone, whether on business or coming down to London to see a show.Overall good value for money"
141,932,"Feb 27 2007 	Very poor standard of food	I have just returned from a three night stay in this hotel with my husband and two young daughters. I booked the hotel directly using the Marriott's own website. I was impressed with the ease of the online booking service -particularly with the Online Concierge facility which enables you to prebook a range of free and costed addtional services prior to your arrival. I booked addtional foam pillows (daughter has asthma), kids activity packs, room with balcony, etc. On arrival, we found that not all of the services we had prebooked had not been arranged (no foam pillows or activity packs). We found the reception and housekeeping staff who dealt with our subsequent enquiry unfriendly and dismissive. Our three night stay was on an inclusive dinner, B&amp;B rate. The dinner menu was the same each night and we found it difficult to choose something different we liked by the third night. The quality of the food was shockingly poor for the star rating of this hotel. Apart from the breakfast (which was great) most of the dinner dishes tasted as if they were pre-packed as opposed to being cooked from fresh. The kids menu also has a limited choice and was, on one occasion, inedible - sausage and mash covered in a burnt,. brown concoction which was described as gravy. On two occasions after having eaten dinner in the restaurant, we were &quot;quizzed&quot; about whether or not we were entitled to the inclusive dinner rate because the restuarant manager had been advised by reception staff that this was not the case. This resulted in me having to go to reception to clarify our booking rate again. We felt as if we were being accused of &quot;freeloading&quot;. we have stayed in many hotels over the years on inclusive rates and have never been subjected to this treatment. Saying all of the above, it may well be that we had a particularly unfortunate experience. There were good points - the rooms are well appointed (beds particularly comfortable) and the kids loved the swimming pool. The waiters and waitresses in the restaurant itself were very friendly and helpful. I can say without hesitation, however, that we have no intention of staying in this hotel again. In fact, I would seriously doubt whether or not we would stay in any Marriott hotel again considering the cost against the actual standard of service received."
142,932,"Feb 14 2007 	The only hotel to look for in London	This is a great hotel, with a very comfortable feel and excellent, friendly staff. Located within easy reach of the tube, which gets you to all the major sites, and also some nice local places to visit, like Hampstead and Primrose Hill.Good value, and I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to town!"
143,932,"Jan 19 2007 	GREAT Hotel Nice People - BEING ROBBED WITH A SMILE	First, the good thigs. The hotel was very nice. Newly remodeled with spacious rooms. Most Americans would feel comfortable in the hotel, especially with added features like American Outlets in the walls. Great location to get to London (by the tube and a couple stops from Oxford St). Overall the lodging was great. Now the bad stuff...Raad Your Bill, Reread Your Bill, then turn-around and READ IT AGAIN!On the first day we went to the restaurant for breakfast. The waiter told us it was included in our room. We went back the next day as well. On the third day the waiter brought us a bill for 60 pounds ($120 for 5 people). He explained that the others were mistaken and we did have to pay for breakfast. I was adament in letting him know that there was no way I would pay and then he relented.The last night of our stay a bill came under the door. Two things stuck out at me. One, they charged us for newspapers. I didn't request them, but they charged me for then. No big deal since I read them anyway -- but they should ask. Second, a bill for 60 pounds per night per room (listed Accomodations). That was 360 pounds and 720 dollars. I prepared this room on Priceline. I went to the counter and they quickly removed the charge with no question. DODGY!!!So, if you don't mind being vigiliant with your bill this is a great hotel."
144,932,"Jan 12 2007 	Marriott Swiss Cottage	I stayed at this hotel for one night last week and my overall impression that at the rate they charge for B&amp;B it is not worth it. On arrival in reception a very young, rather dissevelled looking receptionist (whose badge said , 'In Training' ) was alone at the desk and on a phone call. She continued the call as I waited without any back up from another member of staff. Another customer arrived and still she continued the call. She checked me in quickly but without any real warmth or friendliness.Yes... the beds are the best thing about this hotel. Wonderful linen, duvets, mattress toppers and pillows. However upon entering my room I found that the adjoining door to the next room was unlocked and that at the rate quoted on my check in slip of 350 excluding VAT there was not so much as a packet of biscuits on the rather sparce hospitality tray. The bathroom was an average size filled with far too many towels for one person (or even two) but the lever to empty the bath was broken and so I had to leave my dirty bath water in the tub when I left. My room faced onto the main street and I was aware of the traffic passing although it didnt prevent me from sleeping.What did prevent me from sleeping however was a loud tap tap tapping on each and every door on the corridor at precisely 8.15 a .m. As my alarm was set for a half an hour after that I was horrified and disgusted. The 'tapping' came from 'housekeeping' who woke everyone on the corridor I'm sure and then ... nothing !! What was the point??When I complained about this to the Duty Manager I was informed that I should have hung out my 'do not disturb' sign. I replied that even if I did I would have heard the racket as they proceeded along the corridor tapping on every door. It was like chucking out time at a youth hostel !!! I wouldnt have imagined that one would need to hang out the do not disturb sign unless a sleep in after at least 9 a.m. was required. Maybe I 'm wrong...The breakfast room was bright and cheery and a lovely selection of fruits and hot food was available. However, noone came to my table to ask did I require any of the special hot breakfast dishes listed on the menu. Lunch for our meeting that day was limited but freshly prepared , tasty and a little bit different.Having said all that my overall impression of this hotel was of unfriendly staff who didn't honestly appear to enjoy what they were doing."
145,932,"Jan 8 2007 	This is now my favorite London hotel	Having stayed in London many times, I will never look for a hotel again - this is it. Wonderful everything - lovely room with nice beds and bedding, beautiful leisure center and a terrific breakfast. Staff were fantastic - especial thanks to George K. at reception and David M. at the concierge desk, who were incredibly kind, efficient and helpful. Tube station (Swiss Cottage, on the Northern Line) is two blocks away and a little out of town, but trust me, it's worth the extra travel time to stay here. We are a family of four, and they were able to put us in a family room, non-smoking, that easily accomodated everybody at an unbelievably low price. A wonderful value - I'll be back time and time again."
146,932,"Jan 6 2007 	Loved the Marriott	This is the perfect hotel inLondon for a family of 5! We were able to have a large room with 2 double beds and then a rollaway. There was still room to move and a large clean bathroom! At only 100 pounds it was a great deal. They had lots of families there--a great pool, and a short walk to the metro but in a quiet area. I would definately stay there again!"
147,932,"Jan 4 2007	Good value	We got two nights free with our BA flight and liked the hotel well enough to stay another two. London hotel prices are very high and this hotel is good valuePluses -its a Marriott with almost American size room (we had two queen beds).well equipped with ironing board and kettle.Nice bed linen, high quality goodies in the bathroom. Swimming pool and sauna in hotelVery close to- Swiss cottage which is a major transport hub for buses as well as the tube.Hampstead theater if you like the &quot;off Broadway &quot;experience. We saw an excellent new play Primrose hill for great views of London centerNegatives- generic kind of Marriott, little feel that you are in London. Outrageous mini bar ($5 for a coke) and phone charges Do not use the phone in the room It will cost you $2 a minute for a local call. Hotel looking a little worn e.g.the chair in our room had a split on the end of the arm."
148,932,"Dec 25 2006 	It was OK.	This was a girls week in London and the 3 of us had a great time. The hotel is very close to the Swiss Cottage Tube station and the train station. We took the Heathrow Express and then got a cab to the hotel. The cab was around 14 PBS and took less then 10 min. We had the best cab drivers coming and going. I requested an early check in and only had to wait an hour in the lobby. Since we arrived around 10 am and check in isn't until 2 or 3 pm, we had no problem waiting. Customer service is not the strong point of this hotel. You won't get a big smile or &quot;welcome&quot; when you hit the front door. We had 6 pieces of luggage and no one ever came out to help us bring them in from the cab. Our room was very nice. We had 2 double beds and a rollaway. The bathroom is a little small and the hairdryer is in the desk drawer, which is a huge pain to use while others are trying to sleep or watch TV. I must admit that I am a long time Marriott rewards member, so I ,as well as my 2 roommates, received free access to the executive lounge. I don't know what it costs to gain access to this lounge, but it has to be worth every penny. We had a wonderful breakfast everyday and then heavy appetizers in the evening. This was more then a meal for us. We also enjoyed the unlimited teas, coffees and drinks that were available 24/7. I had read other reviews about having troubles with being charged incorrectly upon check out, so the night before I went to the front desk to just check on my bill and to find out how to get a cab. I'm so glad I did. My room was charged over 200 BPS for someone's dinner and drinking in the pub. At no time did any of my party purchase anything in the hotel. The staff pulled the bill and it was not my signature on the bill. The removed the charges and appolgized. When I checked out the next day, there were more charges on my bill. The receipt was once again pulled and my signature was not on the bill. This time they were less then willing to remove the charges, but did so in the end. I questioned the front desk staff and asked them if they just allow anyone to sign and put a room # down. I was told &quot;no&quot; that you must show your key slip with your signature on it. This is obviously not happening. Watch your bill!"
149,932,"Oct 31 2006 	Great Family Friendly Hotel	We are a family with two boys aged 12 and 9 and booked this hotel for three nights in the 2006 October half term break.We thought the hotel was fantastic, one of the best we have stayed in. The reception was friendly, with goody bags (loads of sweeties) for the children. Our room was very well decorated and furnished, and was spotlessly clean. It was also a good size and there was plenty of space even though we had two enormous beds (brand new beds and bedding).The hotel seems to be very family friendly, no real restrictions to pool access and all the staff we came across were very friendly. The concierge was extremely knowledgable and helpful.Swiss Cottage tube station is around 5 minutes walk (easy access to Oxford Street, Baker Street and the Thames, just a few stops away) and there are also lots of small shops, plus M&amp;S food, Woolworths, Argos, Habitat and supermarket about 10 minutes walk away. We loved our visit to London and our stay at this hotel!"
150,932,"Oct 24 2006	Wonderful Hotel. Heavelnly Bed. Highly Recommend	Got an AMAZING deal on this hotel on priceline UK. Paid 47 pounds (plus taxes) per night for 3 nights. I was a little leery from reading the reviews and my husband is very picky about hotels preferring to say in only very nice hotels. I have been to London twice before, and I knew from experience many of their hotels are far below US standards, and you almost never get more than a double bed. Must to my delight we had 3 rooms and got our request on each and every room. No mention of priceline either. One had a king bed, the other 2 had 2 queen beds. The beds were heavenly! The room spacious and immaculate. The bathroom fair sized and the shower wonderful. This hotel is a solid 3 star even by US standards, and we have stayed in many fine 4 star and resort quality hotels in US as well as abroad. It is an easy 5 minute walk to tube stop, and there are many good eating place, as well as chemist, grocery, etc. within 5-10 minute walk. We got a wonderful full English breakfast for 5 pounds (compared to 16 pounds in hotel) close to hotel. Also had good Chinese and Thai food for less than 10 pounds per person. Marks and Spencer, McDonalds, KFC, also very close. The area is NOT bad or seedy in the least. We felt very safe walking around there by day or night. The staff was very friendly (with the exception for a very rude car valet who was French) the lobby attractive, the concierge very helpful. The food and mini bar is astronomical though so we didn't eat there at all. I did not use the pool; however my son used the sauna, and steam room. Yes, it is a little farther out from city center. But for 15 minutes more in travel time you are rewarded with plush accommodations, and getting back to that heavenly bed about a full day on your feet made it all worthwhile. The money we saved by eating at the restaurants close by as opposed to the more expensive ones in city center was also a big savings for us as we had 3 teenagers along. Unless you are extremely hard to please you will not be disappointed in this hotel. Even my hotel snob husband who travels on business and always stays at 3 or 4 star American hotels was impressed. We had no bogus charges on any of our 3 rooms at check out, as another posted had. Hotel also had aromatherapy toilet items, hair dryer, iron and board, slacks presser, in room and automatic shoe shine in hall. Will be happy to answer any question you may have, feel free to email me."
151,932,"Oct 18 2006 	A generally good hotel but check your bill	When Priceline offered Regents Park, I was expecting something on the Euston Road. I had forgotten the Marriott - which is really in Swiss Cottage. The check-in and room both excellent.The tube at Swiss C is only a few minutes walk and only three stops to Bond Street. It's actually a great location.However, internet acess at GBP15 for 24 hours starting at mid-day and finishing at midday the following day is not a good deal for most business guests arriving late afternoon, esp since I am now accustomed to getting free WiFi in most mainland European hotels.They also tried to stick me with a bill for GBP60 which they claimed was for a &quot;10 minute 'telephone call&quot;Like most guys I now carry a cellphone (two in fact) and a computer with Skype and I only touched their phone to set the wake-up call. Admittedly they removed the charge without further debate and it may have been a genuine mistake but at 6am departure how many guests get stiffed for this kind of thing. The check out clerk merely commented that &quot;this is the cost of hotel phone calls&quot; Well it should not be - not at a Marriott, not anywhere in this day and age. Even if it were genuine it would be a horrendous charge per minute and it leaves a nasty taste from an otherwise great hotel?"
152,932,"Sep 14 2006	Fantastic for Families	We have just returned from a long weekend at the London Marriott Hotel Regents Park. The hotel is great as they have a great swimming pool which our children were allowed to use (unlike some stuffy London hotels), they also gave our children goody bags on arrival and were extremely friendly throughout our stay. We have never experienced such incredible service before. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel, when we went out we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel. The restaurant is great and the chef came out and spoke with us about our food choices and really identified our children as themselves, not talking down to them or speaking to us about their choices.The hotel is extremely convenient for central London and also as I drove down on the M1, has very easy access for my car with a reasonably priced huge secure car park on site.Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in in London and I consider myself extremely fussy!"
153,932,"Sep 4 2006 	A nice surprise	We booked this hotel for a three night stay in London, one week in advance. In the Marriott website we were offered a weekend special package that made our stay a real bargain comparing with other 4-star London hotels. When I later read the reviews posted in TripAdvisor I became a bit worried but fortunately my stay was fairly good.The bed was really comfortable and the room was spacious and well equipped. Besides, I didn't find the neighbourhood dangerous despite one comment I had read in a review.The only problem was the distance to the city centre, but by Jubilee line or by bus nr. 13 it won't take you that long!All in all, comparing with my previous experience in London, I consider that we got good value for our money."
154,932,"Aug 8 2006	Too many trainees in hotel	Why I stayed in this marriott regent park was because my client booked me into this hotel, which I did read some reviews on tripadvisor and I was a bit worrying. It turned out to be unsatisfying as well.Good point of this hotel: Ice making machine on the corridor (which in this soso hot weather, you need ice all the time) Also, use ice to store your food if you stay longer time (Mini fridge is forbidden to use because once you take out any bottle, they charge you automatically). Very comfortable bed, clean bathroom and enough spaces for storage. Cold air-conditioning 24 hrs, free cookies and kettle, iron &amp; iron broad in room.Bad point: Beware the air-conditioning will scare you at night, when it suddently made a loud noise. Too many trainees in the hotel, who don't know much and need to ask their superviser all the time. No porter to carry you lugguges unless you ask them to. Location is too far from central, surrounding area has nothing, only M&amp;S within 8 mins walk. When you check out beware of lots of problem, I stand there over half an hour to explain the bill. The cost is not cheap, 130pounds for double room, so I moved to John Howard hotel for my next 3 days, a bargain and near the central."
155,932,"Aug 3 2006 	nice hotel	We stayed there from July 29-1 August. No problems, but the rooms on one side of the hotel were so noisy we had to move to the quiet side of the hotel. No problems walking to and from Swiss Cottage station, took about 5 mins. You can't beat using the underground to the city. We even used it to get our luggage to Heathrow airport."
156,932,"Jul 6 2006 	As executive as a bus shelter	Stayed here in a Executive room. Lovely king size bed which fills the room. Rooms are too small for the price you pay. No information on what an executive room gives you, ie access to the Executive Lounge, where you also have to pay for Alcoholic drinks. I stayed in a smoking room which smelt like someone had smoked a hundred cigarettes in there, 10 minutes prior my arrival! The location for me is good, access to the tube 5 minute walk, &amp; the staff are always friendly. I always stay here when in London, but just beware that this is not what a Marriott Hotel should be about."
157,932,Jun 28 2006 	Con not very close to Central London	The hotel is an average 3 star hotel and not very close to Central London. In the middle of nowhere and should operate under the 'Marriott' name.
158,932,"Feb 7 2006	Good Value for Money Especially with Kids	This hotel works well for a family with children. Rooms can connect and are large (with two decent beds) and well equipped by London standards for the price. The large inviting breakfast buffet and indoor swimming pool are appealing to children. The location is certainly not central London (it would take 20 minutes on the tube to get to Oxford Street) but is well served by train connections, is walking distance to Primrose Hill park, and has the advantage of two movie theatres in the vicinity. This isn't a &quot;charming&quot; choice, but is very practical for families who want to stay someplace decent on a budget. It also has a convenient car garage."
159,932,"Jan 27 2006	Loved it.	My family and I stayed here in August, and we all enjoyed it. The service was excellent, esp the bell man, I don't know his name, but he was quite cheery. The rooms were clean and modern. It was a nice change, compared to the dump we stayed in Torquay the previous two nights. I enjoyed the fact that this place had balconies. A big plus. I am a smoker, but I don't like smoking in the same room as my son, so it was nice to stand out there instead of running down to the hotel lobby and outside, like the other places we stayed. The only thing, I didn't like was the beds, the mattresses were too soft, but that wouldn't stop me coming here. As long as I didn't have sleep in them for too long. I know it was out of the way, but I much rather stay here, than go to one of those awful budget tourist hotels closer to the attractions, which my husband and I did once years ago. Terrible. We also got a good deal over the net when we booked, and it was one of the cheaper places we stayed at, during our England trip. I would stay here again in a flash."
160,932,Dec 18 2005	A bit out of the way	This Hotel was fine for a Marriott. It wasn't the nicest Marriott I've stayed in but it wasn't the worst either. The room was large and clean. The lobby was always crowded and smoky. Breakfast was more than a bit overpriced. The hotel is located within a 5 minute walk of the Swiss Cottage tube station which meant we could be anywhere in the city within 30 minutes. There are a couple of cafes near by for a better value breakfast and a Marks &amp; Spencer food shop also for snacks or lunch items.We spent 7 nights and it seemed every time we passed the front desk it was crowded. The pool area was well kept and the sauna/steam room helped ease our legs after a day of sightseeing. The gym area was large and well stocked with quite a bit of high end equipment.For the same price (we used Marriott reward points) you could be closer to the center of London if you want. Now that Im more familiar with the city I would say that this is a little out of the way for touring London.
161,932,"Nov 23 2005	Non smokers beware	We have stayed at this hotel for several years. It seems to have a new policy of not confirming non-smoking rooms in advance. If you get a smokers room, it can be more like fire damaged - yellowed and really not a pleasant place for fresh air breathers to sleep. It is also going slowly downhill when compared to the standards of a few years ago. Last comment, 6 porno channels on open display in the room literature led to some awkward questions with our youngest (Marriot had mormon origins - how do they square the porno channels with the religious folk back in the bible belt I do not know !)"
162,932,"Nov 9 2005 	Just what you'd expect from a Marriott	Stayed in November 2005 and the hotel is just what you'd expect from a Marriott. Clean rooms, efficient staff etc, etc. Theres a leisure club with pool that we didnt go into but it looked fine and not too busy. Our room was a good size with two double beds. We tried for a king sized bed but they didnt have any. Breakfast was good with a great selection and they charged what seems to be the standard 16 charge these days. Car parking is available underneath and outside the hotel at 15 for 24 hours which I thought was pretty good for London. There were a couple of weddings on when we stayed and we werent bothered by the noise at all. The bar and resturant are smallish but well run and there's also a small shop selling newspapers, toothpaste etc.As mentioned previously its more Swiss Cottage than Regents Park but thats no bad thing. Swiss Cottage tube is a 5 min walk around the corner which is on the Jubilee Line (10 mins to Bond Street station). We got a black cab to the top of Oxford Street at 8pm and it cost 11, not bad at all. There are some pretty good restaurants in Swiss Cottage including a Benihanas which is great if a little pricy (we were sat next to Nicole Appleton and Kate Thornton when we went, they must have known we were going!). There always seem to be some good deals for this hotel if you do a little digging. We got three nights for 99 each (not including breakfast) which I must admit breaks my personal record for a Marriott so we were very happy."
163,932,Oct 12 2005	Swiss cottage Marriot	review: 'Regents Park' Marriott - this hotel is actually in Swiss cottage (don't go out after dark) and quite a hike from the north end of Regents Park. The taxi fare from the west end back to the hotel set us back 27 (40 euros/$47) plus tip. The hotel itself is next to a busy main road (can be noisy) and is on par with your average Moat House but at twice the price. The buffet breakfast was good but my daughter was not very hungry one morning and we still had to shell out 17 for a bowl of cornflakes and an apple.
164,932,"Apr 17 2005	Just 20 minutes to Oxford Circus from hotel reception!	Whilst I appreciate that this hotel is not smack bang in the middle of Leicester Square, it really isn't that far from central London in the big scheme of things. It takes just three minutes to walk to Swiss Cottage tube station and the Jubilee Line whisks you straight to Bond Street in just three stops, or you can change at Baker Street to go direct to Oxford Circus in just two further stops. Now for the hotel itself... Staff were friendly and helpful, although the wait to check in and out was a little tedious. The concierge was knowledgeable and the general welcome at the Marriott was warm. The room was a good size and in good condition, decorated in a typical Marriott style, ie, one that won't challenge or scare the more conservative traveller! Having patio doors leading onto a small balcony was a bonus, allowing a good amount of fresh air into the room, always preferable to air-conditioning on a warm spring day (though a/c is available in all rooms). The leisure centre is of a good quality, though there were rather more kids around than I would have ideally liked, there are probably fewer during the weekend, mine was a weekend stay. Overall I would recommend this hotel, especially if you can get a room at a rate similar to what I paid. I got the room through a well known bidding travel website and paid just 77 GBP as opposed to the cheapest available rate through the Marriott website which was 145 GP."
165,932,"Mar 30 2005	Not anywhere near central London!	BE WARNED! This hotel is not very close to the centre of London at all, although on the website and in brochures they make out that it is. It is a good half hour by bus or car to most major attractions - In fact it is not even that close to Regents Park, and it is in the middle of a large roundabout! As a resident of London this frustrates me no end, as tourists who have been promised that they are near to main attractions and sights find themselves in the middle of a residental area."
166,932,"Mar 12 2005 	Gone downhill	I have been staying at this hotel for many years and am saddened to experience how down hill it has got. At nearly 200 for the room only you would expect that 'something else', but no what you actually have to come to expect is poor service at a high price. On one occasion after a five hour drive I arrive at 7pm to be told the room is not ready. I bk a table in the restaurant and am kept waiting for 1/2 hr before someone acknowledges me, room service was late and incorrect &amp; the toliet in my room had a problem so I had to haul all my belongings to a different room. I was also charged for items I didn't order. Thankfully the reception staff are used to handling such complaints &amp; dealt with accordingly but this really is not good enough - nor was the free drink they offered - it really should have been a bottle - or a vineyard come to that."

1,934,Mar 14 2008	Old fashioned and tacky	Would stay well clear of London outpost!!!If you like pubs and old fashioned decor then this is for you. The library is a small wallpapered area outside your bedroom door and relaxation is with a 14&quot; tv and a mini bar stocked with 3 pieces of fruit and empty glass bottles.
2,934,"Feb 29 2008 	absolutely fabulous	My sister and I traveled to London on our way to Athens last fall. We stayed three nights on the way to Athens and one night on our way back to the the US. I booked the Outpost for the location, which offers a safe place to walk about for two unescorted, well dressed ladies. We got more than we expected in the way of service and quality. I have never been dissapointed with SLH properties, so book them if you can without fear. This was no exception. The London Outpost is a renovated mansion previously owned by Andrew Carnegie located on a quiet residential street across from a lovely walled garden. When you walk in, you feel like you are coming home. I did not want to leave, ever! Reception from the staff is personal and warm. Decor is luxurious without pretense. They staff really go out of their way to make you feel welcome and are eager to provide any assistance you need with a quiet dignity of service that has long passed in terms of standards for most places. They don't hound you for your credit card, passport, make you sign things when you arrive, etc; it's the little things that say we know who you are and you're one of us that we liked. You get the bill in the end just the same. They know you will pay. So nice to experience such courtesy. It makes travel that much more pleasureable.One of the nicest assets of the hotel is the evening cocktail gathering, when refreshments are offered in the living room free of charge. Guests can meet and discuss the day or plans for the evening. It was nice to meet travelers and hear what they had enjoyed about their stay and where they were going next. I even met a fellow foreign service grad from Georgetown. What a small world. Our outgoing flight from Heathrow was cancalled and we had to fly to Paris in order to catch a flight to Athens. Since we would have to stay in Paris overnight, I called the Outpost after we checked out, and the staff was astute and kind enough to book us a lovely room in Paris at one of their sister SLH hotels, with which we were delighted. What else can I say, the rooms were like home, the service was fabulous, and the location is perfect. It's my new home in London."
3,934,"Oct 8 2007 	good but price is steep for what is offered	My partner and I stayed in this hotel for three nights in September. The location is excellent, the staff are attentive and friendly and the hotel is well kept. Alas a double bed turned out to be two singles pushed together and there were little niggles like no safe in the room and the decor needed freshening up here and there. It does however, have a different ambiance and is a respite from the busy city. I think it struggles just a little to justify the price."
4,934,"Feb 23 2007	chelsea oasis	we stayed here the nights before and after our civil union SOLELY due to the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. The hotel, staff and location lived up to our high expectations. The room was large, comfortable and well appointed. We were met at the door by genuinely friendly people and made to feel as though we were staying with friends - a wonderful experience that helped to make our special day outstanding. I highly recommend the Outpost to those looking for unique accommodation in London"
5,934,"Jan 1 2007 	Great little hotel with great service	Only 11 rooms and each is different. We stayed four times at London Outpost this year both as a primary vacation spot and as a stopping-off place. We had 4 different rooms; each unique each with its own quirk that makes it special. Breakfast in the conservatory is fun. The staff is top-knotch and dedicated to serving your needs. Location is a 3 minute walk to the Sloane Square tube station in Chelsea, and easy walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants. There is something very special about this place. We will continue to use this as our London home. For a dining experience ask them to get you seats in the back room at Rizoi."
6,934,"Feb 28 2006	five star service	I just spent nine days at the Outpost and as a single female traveller can highly recommend it for security and location. The most outstanding feature of my stay however was the staff - butlers and managers were the best. As stated by others, this is not an inexpensive hotel but does provide understated elegance, quiet atmosphere and superb location with the expectations of the SLH group met completely."
7,934,"Feb 14 2006	Fantastic location 	We stayed at the Outpost for almost 2 weeks - both holiday &amp; business and the place was superb - great staff, excellent location (for those interested in quality London shopping and proximity to the best places - Harvey Nicks, Harrods, Sloane Str). Rooms are decorated in the period English style with tastefully assembled antique furnishings &amp; prints. The entire hotel feels more like a country house than a hotel - it certainly helps that the place only includes 11 rooms and staff can provide truly personalized service to their guests. Both butlers are terrific and go out of their way to make sure their guests are taken care of, always have hot tea, etc. Not the cheapest option for London, however highly recommended for travellers with high standards."
8,934,Aug 8 2003	Friendly and Unique	Outstanding small (11 room) hotel tucked in on a quiet back street in Chelsea. Very good value for the money. Excellent staff. If you're looking for a top notch place away from major tourist areas (but 5 minutes from the District and Circle lines at Slone Square) this is it.
9,934,"May 5 2003	Step back in Time	The Carnegie Outpost is located a couple of blocks from the Sloane Street tube station. It is like stepping into Edwardian era London. If you like a quiet hotel with lots of comfort, charm, and a gracious atmosphere- this is it. But it comes at a price."
1,936,"Sep 12 2009 	this place should be condemned..absolutely disgusting and dangerous	do not look at the pictures on the web site, its nothing like !! never been to such a [--] hole in all my life..it should be condemned and closed immediately so it doesnt cause psychological damage to anyone else. Environmental health should be called in now. They have a notice on the window that forbids you to enter with any cameras or recording equipment (i wonder why ?)

5,936,"Aug 1 2009 	The most terrible hotel I've ever seen	The website looks really nice but you shouldn't believe a single word.1) The 24 hour reception was closed, I had to wait outside the hotel and phone them2) They wanted to give me the wrong room, I've booked a studio with kitchen included but they wanted to place me in a single room. She began to search for the reservation sheet and found it after 20 minutes!!3) The lady wanted me to pay cash although the website said I can pay by credit card. We had a long discussion and she gave in.4) When she showed me the studio it hadn't been cleaned yet. Everything was dirty, no fresh linen on the bed, the wardrobe was broken and there was even a dirty t-shirt on the ground. So I refused to stay.A strange thing is that I checked my credit card statement and found another debit of London Shelton Hotel. I'm sure I have never signed the bill containing this amount.Summary: It's shabby and dirty, staff is unfriendly, dodgy and unmotivatedNearly everything that's written on the webpage is a lie.So don't go there."

We really liked this hotel.....arriving from Sweden the night before to a hotelin Piccadilly with was so awful you couldnt sleep in the bed, we found this hotel and we liked it alot...we booked for 2 nights but we stayed one night extra.....If we are going back to London we will come back....you can be sure of that.Nice people working, nice rooms and a very good service!!!! 5 stars from Agneta, Malin, Kristin, Monica, Gustaf and Eric from Sweden."

Room very basic, faded duvet cover, room not very clean, Bathroom not great, T.V. badly tuned, wires attached but everywhere. Eventually got hold of receptionist at 14.10 p.m. and she said she would sort it out, for our return from London at 18.30p.m., waited for 2nd room to be sort out, asked for compensation said no, 2nd bedroom, toilet seat dirty, no curtain in bathroom, view onto busy road. No card payment accepted only cash, put cash in top shirt pocket, no banking or accounting system. Asked for a drink, no bar facilities available. Continental breakfast, tea, coffee, toast, marmalade, 2 x susuages, fried egg (very oily), tried over stay for poached egg, didn't understand, scrabbled turned out as an omelete, no salt, pepper or tomatoe sauce and table not set. Bathroom was not cleaned or new towels given over 4 day stay. Difficulty in sleeping as noisy busy road. Hotel up for sale, advertisement should be removed from all internet accommodation sites, as nothing like write up or photographs. Bad impression of London for visitors from Canada."
8,936,"Apr 27 2009 	Cheap and Cheerful!	After reading the other reviews about this hotel i was quite worried about staying here. This worry was proven to be unjust as soon as we arrived at the hotel. The staff were welcoming and accomodating, the hotel although not plush was tidy and had the basic essentials for a weekend trip to the footy! I'd recommend this hotel to friends and people who have a bit of life in them. The only people who wouldn't enjoy this hotel would be snobs or stuck up people who have othing better to do than moan and complain! Thoroughly enjoyable stay!"
9,936,"Mar 18 2009 	Basic but OK for a 1 nite stay for the footie.	When you enjoy a stay for one day - a football match and you like it cheap. it is ok to book. My partner and I stayed at the Hotel as it was easy access to the Emirates Stadium.Location was good - near Finsbury Park, and the Tube Station. Lots of bars and takeaways nearby.We stayed for 1 night.We were able to check in early - 11.3OAM. Check out time was 11.30am.The lock on the door was dogdy and difficult to lock.The bed was comfortable.The TV was large but did not work properly, unless you stood there and held the aerial in yourself.We had to pay in full before viewing the room.Breakfast not as described, (continental)we had sausage, egg, baked beans and 2 pieces of toast.The main light in the bedroom did not work.The shower facilties were not exactly wonderful- shower curtain was disgusting, which wrapped around you when showering.Staff were friendly.There were no parking facilities.Price was good, considering it was London.Would stay again for 1 or 2 nites."
10,936,"Aug 6 2008 	""How bad could it be?"" - Famous last words!	This 'hotel' is awful! My boyfriend and I decided to book a cheap hotel for the night, thinking 'how bad could it be?' - famous last words! I would not recommend this hotel to anbody, least of all children as we could smell drugs being smoked in multiple rooms. Once inside our room, we discovered just how dirty it was. The bed was covered in hair and the shower thick with black mould. The tiling within the shower was frankly dangerous as it was sticking out at very sharp angles. We decided to leave after approximately 5 minutes of entering the hotel. Please don't make the same mistake!"
11,936,Nov 28 2007	Great Hotel!!	this was a lovely and friendly hotel...me and my kids went to stay for the weekend and enjoyed it very much with its cosy atmosphere..thankyou!
12,936,"Oct 2 2007 	Hell Hole	Turned up to be told the reservation had not been kept as the card had been declined but payment was supposed to be made on arrival according to the website I used?? I agree with all the comments about this place and find them all to be true, being dodgy and I did get the brothel feeling about the place too. It also seems to have DSS residents too. We were going to see Spurs and it is not that close to be honest. It is a treck from the nearby stations on the tube. It is a disgusting hotel with mildew in the showers and dirty carpets. Various windows including one in my mates room were smashed. We were locked in when we went leave in the morning and the only staff we could find were Spanish and eastern European and spoke no English. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!"
13,936,"Oct 2 2007	Proper Shite	Avoid this place like the plage! I was booked in to stay here 2 weeks ago, the area the hotel in is terrible and I would not even get out of my car here, next door is a tyre yard and the reception is in a shed like lean to next door to the hotel which had taxi drivers hanging around outside. The restraunt for the hotel doubles up as an indian take away which was not exactly what I was expecting from a hotel restaturant.Further to this, altough I cancelled my booking they are claiming that I stayed and have since debited my credit card that I used for the reservation."
14,936,"Aug 27 2007 	Schrecklich Awful Terribl -- avoid this place at all costs!	1. This place is no where near Finsbury Park!! It is in the middle of freaking no where (Haringey)2. Morning, noon or night: the hotel &quot;staff&quot; actually keep the main door locked, meaning you cannot leave or enter the place without being let in/out-- which does not exude confidence in the area or dispel the rumours that their is a brothel on the lower floor. I was sharing a room with my friend and we just got 1 key! Once I had to explain who I was for 5min before they let me in. 3. Disgustingly dirty, loud (main road) and uncomfortable rooms (no chairs, bedside tables) and unhygienic bathrooms. It's the type of place where you want to bring your own bedding and towels. 4. I have many friends from my student days in London -- imagine my delight when they showed up on the hotel doorstep asking for me and where turned away like criminals: No visitor's allowed, it's the hotel's policy!!! Well they should say so in the hotel description!5. Breakfast room doubles as Pizza parlour / Indian restaurant! One look inside was enough to make me wanna grab something from some where else"
15,936,"Aug 24 2007 	DO NOT STAY HERE	This was supposed to be a romantic weekend away without the kids! It was the most awful experience I have had. We had booked for two nights but only stayed for one.The room was filthy. the breakfast unedible, the staff unhelpful and at night we couldn't sleep for the groups of youths outside revving their car engines and playing loud music. A night I never want to go through again!"
16,936,"Jul 31 2007	Awful. Don't stay here	My girlfriend and I came from Ireland to see an Arsenal match. The hotel pictures on internet looked lovely. We understood there was a 24 hr. reception. Not so! We had to wait for hours to get into our room. Our room was shabby and dirty. The bathroom was filthy. The tv did not work. Each time we tried to make tea the milk curdled. We even bought our own milk and the same thing happened, so there must have been something wrong with the water which we got in the bathroom. We did not have breakfast - we did not feel brave enough... Our towels were not changed, nor the room cleaned while we stayed there. One staff member was nice but the rest were rude and uncaring. They insisted we leave our room key in reception each day as we went out. They did not give us a key to the front door at any time. when we objected to this rule, they said it was their policy. We felt very uncomfortable that anyone could have access to our room when we were not there. We did not stay out late as we were afraid there would be nobody on reception to let us in!!We found the whole experience of staying at the shelton hotel upsetting and very disappointing, and we definately will not be staying there again."
17,936,"Mar 8 2007 	Absolutely Disgusting	We booked this hotel on London Hotels 4 u website which showed a nice picture of a room of this hotel and a description of all the facilities. How wrong was this! When we pulled up we couldnt believe it, the reception is actually on the street! We were then given our room which was just inside the main front door off the street. The room was disgusting, smelly and dirty with cigarette burns in the bed sheets, massive dirty black stains on the carpets, the shower was broken and hanging off. We asked to be moved, and was given a slightly bigger room but was just as dirty. We as two women on our own did not feel comfortable at this hotel so we felt the need to put furniture in front of our room door for the night. Breakfast was just as bad having to sit in the Indian Restaurant attached to this place. Nobody turned up to do breakfast until 8.15am. We could only face eating tea and toast as we didnt trust the hygiene. There is also some kind of club under the restaurant which we think is some kind of brothel. DO NOT STAY HERE"
18,936,"Feb 7 2007	good experience	I went with my family to stay at this hotel for new years, it had all the things we needed, it was a clean and the staff was very friendly. They also served a lovely breakfast."
19,936,"Feb 6 2007	Do not stay here!!!!	I stayed at this hotel in 2003. I have heard that it has been renovated. The hotel is awful, I went to have a shower luckily there was hot water. But I was shocked to see cockroaches in the bathroom and rentokil ( mice poison). NEVER IN MY LIFE AGAIN.I did not dare try the breakfast. If it is your first time in London and want a cheap hotel to stay in please do not ruin your holiday."
20,936,"Jan 16 2007 	Worst hotel ever	This is the worst hotel ever! I'll give a &quot;short&quot; summary of my experiences:SATURDAY* When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday, the water boiler was broken. They would fix it before the evening, but we could not take a shower or even freshen up.* The water boiler in the room (for making coffee or tea) was burnt and had flakes on the bottom. We decided not to make coffee, which was a good thing because the soluble coffee's expiration date was June 2006. * The bed had only one sheet, i.e. one to wrap the mattress. There was only a comforter on top which I doubt was washed before putting us in the room. We thought they had just forgotten to put a sheet under the comforter, but when we asked for an extra sheet, the owner did not understand what we needed that for. Only after suggesting we pay for the sheet, he agreed on giving us one.* When we came back at night after dinner, we found out that the heater did not work. When we complained about that, we were transferred to a different room. Here, of course the same drama with the sheets happened again. The owner got annoyed when we asked him for an extra sheet (not the mention that the coffee was expired in this room as well, and the water boiler had flakes in it too).MONDAY* In the morning, there was no warm water so that we had to take a cold shower. We decided not to say anything and just hope the warm water would be back at night.* At night, we still didn't have warm water, so we reported that. The owner would have a look at it. We reported at around 11pm, and at 12.30am, when we were already asleep, he knocked on our door to check. We told him we were already sleeping. For the record, there were almost NO guests in the hotel, so he could not have been busy with other guests. TUESDAY* At night, after walking around in London all day, we found out that the bed had been refreshed. A good thing, but again there were no sheets!! When we asked the owner for some sheets, he told us he'd be right with us. An hour and a half later, at 1am (!), he finally arrived with extra sheets.WEDNESDAY* There was no water pressure in our room. When we reported this, we were asked to take a shower in yet another room. The room had just been used by a guest who had left an hour before. The room had not been cleaned up yet, but an employee quickly cleaned the shower for us. When we entered the room, clearly the guest before us had been smoking, so the room smelled badly. For that reason, we refused an offer to change rooms once again."
21,936,"Sep 23 2006 	absolute disgrace	The first word that entered my head when we pulled up in the taxi was SEEDY! My boyfriend had paid online with his debit card for the hotel so there was no going back, I wanted to cry. After meeting the manager he infomed us that we &quot;thought we had paid, but we hadn't&quot;. A complete lie because the money had already been taken from his bank account. He suggested we pay upfront in cash, we refused. I think he must have realised we weren't half wits and dropped the subject. After flying in from barcelona and travelling all day we were both looking forward to a nice hot shower. No chance. The water was freezing and the plughole was blocked. What a shambles!! The only good point about this god awful place was the train station just across the street. perfect for a hasty escape!!"
22,936,"Aug 7 2006 	The worst stay I have ever had	This was without doubt the worst stay of my life - (had to be there as was working on a site nearby) - the rooms on the ground floor are opposite an Indian - this was deserted for the 5 nights of our stay - it has plastic tablecloths and this is where breakfast is served (though we were not brave enough to try it!!). There is a huge flat screen tv on the back wall of the indian, this enables the rather deaf staff to sit and listen to bollywood films at full volume til midnight every night. The room had bare electric cables hanging out the wall, the pillows were rich tea biscuits, I have managed to cry faster than the shower (thats if you could get the temp stable) - also the guttering leaked onto a pipe right outside my window which sounded like a tin can being reshaped!!I am sure if animals stayed there the RSPCA would be round to condemn it.Unless you really dislike yourself DO NOT STAY here.And as for the website - I have never read such utter tosh - they even advertise a honeymoon suite - good god you would have to hate your bride to make her stay here!!You have been warned....."
23,936,"Jul 28 2006	Warning do not stay here!	Warning do not stay here! Warning do not stay here! Warning do not stay here!It is disgusting. We found it so putrid that we wanted to leave but they refused to give us our money back. They said it was because they had turned down other bookings but they place was deserted. We left after one night anyway. The breakfast was served by a woman smoking a cigarette, the coffee was like battery acid and when we asked her if there was anything other than tea or coffee for the kids she sternly said No!. The locals told us it is a brothel. Just learn form our mistake and dont stay there. Its on way to ruin your holiday!"
24,936,Jan 31 2007	Un seul mot...HORRIBLE
1,939,"Nov 23 2009 	Good value but nothing special	Spend one night during March. Room was on the first floor, but still quite nice and quiet during the night (Thu-Fri). A bit old fashioned interior and furniture. I wish they would get rid of the old linen and buy new decent ones. Same goes for pillow and blankets which are really inchy...Other wise the complete experience was rather good."
2,939,"Oct 13 2009 	Highly Recommend Great staff Great location  Very friendly vibe	We greatly enjoyed our stay at the London Town Hotel, the staff were very friendly and helpful with any requests we had. The room was very comfortable , everything we needed and a very relaxed feel. The first floor lounge was a great idea, with tea making facilities and large TV and also great info on local shopping , markets etc in Hotel visitors book, it was also a great way to meet other travellers. The breakfast was basic continental , and delicious .I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone staying in this area. Very close to tube station, and local resturants and supermarkets Very, very happy. Thank you"
3,939,"Oct 4 2009 	Close to the tube on a quiet street	The room was small and comfy and a few minute walk to Earl's Court station (the tube). We didn't go to London for a plush roomy hotel...we were looking for a reasonably priced room and this was it. We were on the third floor which had a street view and a large window which we kept open the entire time due to no A/C. Penywern Road was extremely quiet but most nights there were loud and rowdy patrons out very late. The room had an en suite bathroom, a work desk, and a TV. Breakfast was less than desirable. Don't choose this hotel because breakfast is included. It consisted of tea/coffee, OJ, corn flakes with milk and canned fruit. Toast and boiled eggs were available upon request. We ate breakfast out every morning after that. There were several great street vendors and shops nearby that sold inexpensive good fruit, donuts/pastries, coffee, etc. The hotel offers reservation booking for local attractions and baggage storage if you take a day trip and don't want to take your luggage with you."
4,939,"Sep 2 2009 	why look elsewhere?	Visited last week (August main holiday period) with three young children, booking / arrival /room / breakfast / staff all friendly and all was very satisfactory - and I have worked &amp; travelled in Hotels for 40 yrs- also London - been very many times - the street was safe with relatively little traffic &lt;no traffic noise&gt;,area was safe,for children + adults alike, several small shops /restaurants + M&amp;S supermarket closeby, Tube very convenient on 3 good lines; breakfast very adequate , service super - computer access in coffee lounge exc. idea - no excessive noiseor any bother"

6,939,"Jul 6 2009 	Clean comfortable convenient and well priced	We stayed on two occasions on our travels. We booked for the second stay as we left the first time. We found the staff friendly and helpful, the breakfast good, room comfortable and clean and the location ideal - just a short walk to public transport. It does not pretend to be 5 star but neither is the tariff. If we return to London, we will stay again."
7,939,"Jun 23 2009 	Convenient location value for money.	This charming little townhouse was among rows of similar Victorian-styled townhouses which are also converted to hotels. Not hard to find, just a stone throw away from Earl's Court Station. I paid 45pounds for a single room for a night and was pleasantly surprised to find that breakfast was included too. The breakfast was sufficient, with a spread of coffee/tea, yogurt, toasts and jams, boiled eggs and cereals. I asked for a bright and airy room as i was terrified of stuffiness and dark rooms which will spike off my imagination.They gave me a bright and tiny room 303 with a small but clean toilet. Although the room is only enough for a single bed, the ceiling is high and airflow is good when i opened my window. the room faced the street so noises are inevitable. I'm happy with the room and also find the common lounge with free tea/coffee and internet at 1 pound per 30mins very useful. If i'm going back to London, i will go back to this hotel."
8,939,"Mar 31 2009 	Good Location But Very Thin Walls	Location of hotel is good. Walls are very thin! We were in a basement room and could clearly here the normal volume telephone conversation of the person in next room. All sounds passed through what must be very thin walls. It was not funny at night when his TV was on. Too late in the night to change rooms for a one night stay. Luckily he turned it off when I asked very politely. We didn't bother using the shower it wasn't very appealing. The breakfast was very basic continental. Guess you get what you pay for. The receptionist on arrival was very helpful. Her colleague, on departure, was totally uninterested in our thin walls complaint."
9,939,"Mar 15 2009 	Great location!	It is quite difficult to find accommodation in London which is reasonably priced, well located, clean and not too cramped.London Town hotel definitely ticks all the boxes; we had a great stay there!"
10,939,"Feb 5 2009 	Great for Price and Location	Needed 2 Single rooms for myself and my Mother.None of the usual nonsense about single room supplements,so very affordable for those on a budget.Location is fantastic for the Tube and the area in general very good.Hotel was very clean,and the staff very helpful.The area seemed very safe,or as safe as a central London location can be,and the hotel itself felt very secure,something my Mother in particular appreciated.Good continental breakfast,and joy of joys,a hotel that had both its heating on and a shower that was hot.I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again and will definately be returning."
11,939,Nov 22 2008 	Good clean accommodation	We stayed in the London Town hotel from 10th to 12th November. The room was basic but very clean and an amazing shower!breakfast was fine for continental. It was a very good location for the tube into London centre too. Overall a good experience.
12,939,"Oct 30 2008	A Great Deal	My sister, parents and I stayed in family room (on the 3rd floor) that had 1 double bed and 2 single beds. The room was clean bright and airy with two huge windows that reached the ceiling. The room had lots of space for us all with a nice large bathroom as well, the only downside was there was no bathtub. We were not expecting much space after reading reviews of all London hotels being tiny. We didn't find this with our room at all!Our room was cleaned daily. Breakfast was more than adequate especially as there was no extra charge for it. Most hotels I have stayed in charge a supplement.The hotel had a lounge where we could sit and relax and get tea/ coffee. I especially liked the patio area and garden.For the price we paid we were very happy with the room, the hotel and the service we recieved.Liked  Nice big roomDisliked  No bathtub"
13,939,"Aug 12 2008 	My Dirty Bed!	Two friends and I came in from Italy and didnt arive at the hotel until near midnight, when we had setteled in and about to go to bed to my Horror my bed sheets where so disgusting I started freeking out. There were stains on the top bed cover when you turned it over and when I pulled back the sheet there was alot of dirt and hairs, I have photos to prove it! So at around 2am I went to compain no chance would I sleep in that and it was a bit earlie in the morining to look for another hotel. I told the night porter it was a discrase and I wanted new sheets, it was well I wasnt cold I only got a sheet, he didnt seem to care. I complained in the morning to the receptionest who said the sheets were changed EVERY DAY, dirt dosnt just get there by itself, the sheets were not changed from the last person, horrible! I enformed her we would be back by 1pm to change, then the cleaning staff said they were about to go in and when we returned, angry as I was I told her I had enformed the receptionest she continued to moan so I closed the door. (We returned for 10min) lack of communication &amp; not listening to your paying customer.The top sheet was still dirty but seen no point in complaining as nothing was getting done about it. A bottle remained under my bed for my stay that was not our's, not to much cleaning done and not checked regulary by manager.The breakfast was awful, at 8.30am there was no where to sit, the boiled eggs were cold and so over cooked so it was toast, an apple or a choice of two cerials no English Breakfast in site but would forigners no how to make it? Dissipointed as I work in the Hospitality area."
14,939,"Aug 5 2008 	Dirty and disappointing.	Having never stayed in London previously, I relied heavily on reviews on this site and others to help select a place to stay. As most of the reviews for this hotel were fairly positive and it was close to the price range I was trying to stay within I booked it for two nights. We were in a ground floor room just past reception. The room was small and the bathroom tiny, but room size was not that important to me as usually we were only in our room to sleep and bathe. My main problem with this hotel was that it was not clean. I turned back the bedspread and there were stains that looked like blood and urine on the underside. The sheets though seemed clean enough. The bathroom had a horribly musty, moldy smell, which we tried to alleviate by propping open the bathroom door and leaving the room window open while we were out during the day. It didn't really help. Both nights of our stay the smoke detector in the room started to beep at around 3:00am. I had to get the receptionist to come and silence it. I told the day receptionist at check out so that it could be looked into, but though he apologized for us being disturbed he went on to make some excuse about the room temperature sometimes setting it off. The impression I got was that it probably happens often, they know about it but don't seem inclined to fix it. The breakfast that was included was adequate and the breakfast room, though in the basement,was bright and cheery. On the plus side, was the location right around the corner from the Earl's Court underground station. The neighborhood around felt safe which was important since it was just my daughter and myself traveling together. We had some nice dinners in the restaurants in the neighborhood. The staff was friendly and helpful to a point, They just didn't seem inclined to go out of their way unless pushed which is not my style. The street is lined with similar small hotels, maybe one of them would be a better choice."
15,939,May 29 2008 	Great service and location (metro-Earl's Court)	I stayed there for 2 nights and enjoyed my stay. The service was great and the room was cleaned! i only paid about $130 for two which I expected to get a small room. What I really liked about it is that it's a block away from the train station. I stayed in Victoria area in the past and it's too crowded - if you're looking for a family or to get away from the city center (which is only a 10 minutes tube ride) then I strongly recommend the place.
16,939,"May 23 2008	Clean and affordable	I have now stayed at the London Town Hotel for the second time in between my travels from Europe to the Middle East. I returned to the hotel because it offers clean and simple rooms at affordable prices for London. In addition, on both occasions I have found the staff to be friendly and willing to help with any queries I had. I have previously stayed at another hotel at a similar price on the same road to which I will not be returning. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere comfortable, clean and welcoming to stay at a decent price."
17,939,"May 6 2008 	Poor intoductiont to Europe	I trusted our travel agent to book three night's London accommodation for us, on our first overseas trip. The London Town Hotel in Earl's Court was our point of arrival in Europe. We arrived, very weary, early in the morning and as it was too early to check in, asked to have our bags minded while we went out for the day. &quot;Minding&quot; meant leaving them in the corner of the public corridor. We were worried about our things all day. The room was very small and stuffy. The floors creaked, so people above disturbed us and the walls were so thin we could clearly hear the people speaking next door (at 2am!) The shower was blocked. You had to shower quickly as it filled up with water and nearly overflowed every time. We had to ask for toilet paper. The staff pretty much ignored us. The breakfast was fine. I got a few itchy bites which I suspect, after doing some research, were bed bug bites, but not certain. As our room was at the back of the building, there was little traffic noise. We were hoping for better than this for the three star rating and the price."
18,939,"May 1 2008 	Loved the London Town Hotel	My husband and I just returned from London where we stayed two nights at the London Town Hotel. We had a room on the top floor with a private (ensuite) bathroom. Our room was very clean and looked to have been recently painted. The double bed was comfortable, the sheets clean, carpet clean, towels in bathroom also clean. We found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast which was more than adequate for us and included toast, butter and jelly, boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, juices, coffee, hot chocolate and tea. It was very close to the Earl's Court tube station and was very quiet at night. We would stay there again and recommend it to anyone on a budget."
19,939,"Apr 3 2008	London Town Hotel	I have stayed in quite a few hotels around the 70 to 80 price range and not one off them could even be compared to The London Town Hotel. What a disapointment. Having never visited London before i was unsure as to what to expect from a London Hotel. The problems began from the minute we entered the door. Although greeted by friendly staff at reception we were asked to pay the first nights fee up front - something which was NOT stated when we booked. I understand that there may have been a security element to this but like any other hotel the London Town hotel could have taken our bank card details without charging any money. We then made our way up to the fourth floor in the tiny lift to our room which I have to say you had to go single file into. Both the bathroom and bedroom were tiny although i was willing at first to look past this if the cleansiness was up to scratch - I later found it was in fact not. Going to bed that night i checked the sheets as any person would do and found multiple stains - i was too tired to even complain. The floor was absolutley filthy. we were then woken, as we were both mornings we stayed with creaking from the people above us. it was absolutley ridiculous how much you could hear and the noise coming from the creaky floorboards was unbearable - is definatley something that has to be heard to be believed. this was at 6.30 am so it was a good job we hadn't planned an lie in's. Breakfast was basic. I took a glass of warm orange juice and to be very honest it was hard to know who were the staff an who were the customers. Our window refused to open. Having spent the day in London we were looking forward to getting back to the hotel and to bed. However when we arrived back at 10.30 the creaking was continuing and we discovered that our towels had not been changed and we had no toilet roll. surely these are the simple things you would just expect. Some good points to the London Town Hotel is that is is really near to the tube station and there is no noise outside at night. The staff are friendly but not at all overly helpful. I just think there's a lot that can be improved on and at the minute the hotel is not worth the price they are charging. Overall we had a very disapointing stay in the London Town Hotel and would not consider returning."
20,939,"Mar 28 2008 	loved the london town hotel	My 12 year old son and I were on a fixed budget and needed a clean place to stay in London that was reasonably priced and close to the tube station.We booked a twin room and were very happy with it. It was clean, bright and cheerful, a good size, had a nice bathroom and a decent continental breakfast. The room was also well heated(it snowed when we were there!) very quiet and the staff were nice. I had read other reviews about this hotel on trip advisor before we left and all I can say is some people may expect to much for what they are paying."
21,939,"Mar 2 2008 	Great Hotel	I actually booked this hotel for my honeymoon. I've been to Europe many times before and know that european hotels are (on average)smaller than US's. It was a pleasant stay and it was so close to the tube. The staff was wonderful and very very knowledgable. They looked up events for us and arranged the taxi to pick us up, etc. We were out sight seeing most of the day but when we came back our bed was always made, the bathroom cleaned and everything in order. I would definatly go back!"
22,939,"Feb 3 2008 	Good hotel at a Good price	On visiting London from Bombay, India I stayed here for 5 nights with my wife and child. We had a room with a double bed and a single bed. The room and bathroom were clean and seemed to be well kept. Very Friendly staff and decent breakfast. The hotel location is excellent. It was very convenient for us to see London as the tube station is just around the corner.  The good selection of restaurants around the corner was a blessing as my son can be really fussy with his food!! All in all, good hotel in a good location, will book again next time in London. Muji,"
23,939,"Jan 20 2008 	Value for money	First of all I would like to thank all the staff and owners at London Town Hotel for my fantastic stay. They were extremely helpful to meet my needs whilst attending a friends wedding in Knightsbridge, London. The location is convenient to and from the Airport and Central London, all of which again was arranged by London Town. I made a single call to have all my taxis booked, requests re shopping, places to go for bargains during the sales, places to eat, and even getting my hands on a pair of last minute sort after theatre tickets. The room for the standard you are paying is way above its rating and value for money from the comfort and cleanliness you would expect in your own home to breakfast in the morning. N.B. book early though as it gets very busy during the week. On my first nights stay, I ended up going for a drink with a couple of guests I met in the lounge whilst checking my mail. Both have been coming to London for business for a few years now from Beijing and have stayed at London Town every time. HarrySydney Harbor"

1,941,"Nov 3 2009 	clean and friendly front desk but the smallest double rooms in the world	coffee,hair drier etc.but no room to put anything bigger than a handbag.Breakfast ok but those rooms should be turned into singles."
2,941,"Oct 15 2009	Good location but cramped	Hotel nearby Earls Court tube station. Small twin room en suite, just barely space for 2 suitcases. Small is also the operative word for the breakfast room. Seemed a little bit too small around 8.30 - 9.00. I was satisfied with the cleaning of our room during our stay. But when we left I lifted the beds to see if we had dropped anything under them. It did not look like it had been cleaned in quite a while. The location is good though with many good restaurants and pubs in the area. All in all a hotel I would not bring the family, but for a football and pub trip with the guys; it's quite OK."
3,941,"Oct 15 2009 	Hotel Lord Jim / Bed bugs.	Hotel Lord Jim has a standard far below what we expected. The rooms were tiny, dirty, smelly and the staff were not polite or nice. We intended to stay for four nights but left after one night.. We were not alone in our room, our beds were also a place for bed bugs.The manager didnt see this as a problem , for us it was a big one.Find any other hotel , dont stay at Lord Jim."
4,941,"Oct 9 2009 	Bedbugs	We came to stay early october and found rooms so small we could hardly fit in our suitcases, not like the pictures at all. But it was getting worse, far worse, the rooms had bedbugs. We left the hotel the next morning and found another one. The state of the rooms were below any standard. The worst was that the management did not see the bedbugs as a problem. They should take the problem seriously and clean out this filthy hotel. Who wants to wake up with the bed full of bloodstains from the hungry bugs???! Disgusting! Do not stay at Lord Jim!"
5,941,"Sep 22 2009 	One large advantage - very good location	Only one reason if you wish to choose this hotel  very convenient location/arrangement. The metro station (Earl's Court Station) is located in 1 minute of walking from hotel; this branch line connects directly to Heathrow and to the centre too. Its the beautiful and well-known area Kensington. There are a lot of shops, pubs, the cafe Internet - and so forth. Its simply pleasant area.Hotel very poor inside, at enough high prices even for 2 stars hotel. Class rooms single with a shower tiny, all furniture are very old, a bath is not too pure, its very noisy all night long (at least for those who receives numbers on 1 or 2 floors). A breakfast is poor. The basic disadvantages  its not enough area/place, the old age, dirtiness, noise. I dont approach for family rest and/or rest with children, only for young people/students or the people travelling on affairs of business."
6,941,"Sep 22 2009 	Don't stay here we had a terrible time	I booked this hotel and asked for a 3 bedded room. On check-in the room they gave us was a 2 bedded and at first they said a 3rd bed had not been requested. They gave me a copy of their reservation paperwork and sure enough, my request was there, they had just failed to read it. They said there was nothing they could do for us that night, despite one of us having to sleep on the floor. However, they did say they would move us the next day. Next, the toilet didn't work so the workman came to fix it, didn't knock before entering and caught my friend getting changed. When I started to voice my displeasure they offered to refund 15 (10 USD) saying that as they had upgraded us to another room, we did not really qualify for a refund. In reality, they had now given us the origional room I had reserved. The Lady on the front dest was appaling and her poor manner, lack of respect and very poor attitude was disgraceful. Words cannot describe the horrid-ness of this person.The first room was very, very shabby and some of the furniture had not been dusted in some time. There was not enough room to swing a cat and of course, the toilet didn't work for the duration of our stay in that room.The second room was an improvement on the first and nicely decorated. However, the shower room/bathroom/toilet smelled damp."
7,941,"Jul 19 2009 	Great hotel	My friend and I stayed at the Lord Jim two different times during our stay in London and we were very pleased. The staff was very accomedating. In fact on our return to London we were to stay at a hotel across the street and they didn't have a room for us and the Lord Jim set us up with rooms on short notice. The gentleman that worked at the front desk went out of his way to help us,. Everyone helped us out . The rooms were small but comfortable and very nice and clean. I would recomend this hotel to anyone. It was also close to shopping and the tube.Thanks especially to the young gentleman that spoke six or so languages!! Deb &amp; Deni"
8,941,"Jul 19 2009	School Trip	Lord Jim's ist practical for people who'll stay for two or three days at London. The most terrible breakfast I ever had was there, so everyone should take a look for the next bakery. I can't complain about the rooms, they were clean and big. We just had to look for the light switch, who was in the closet."
9,941,"Jul 10 2009 	Not a good choice	I was looking forward to staying at this hotel and have been to three hotels in the area, but this was the most disappointing one. Incredibly cramped rooms for not a small price, daytime staff was impudent, don't count on the wifi actually working and most time it will be very slow.There are other choices out there (at least fifteen hotels in the same street) and if you look ahead of time you're very likely to find something much more appeasing that this. I have."
10,941,"Jun 11 2009 	Excellent value for money	Overall my stay at the Lord Jim was great. We had a nice room, they are small rooms as all hotels in London are but I wouldn't say it was cramped although the bathroom was definitely compact - fully functional though.The staff were extremely helpful, especially in the morning. It was the day of the tube stikes and they were keeping up to date with line information and gave excellent advice on how to complete my journey to work.If you're looking for a nice hotel and a great price in London that's literally round the corner from the tube station then this is a great place to consider."
11,941,"May 12 2009 	Basically a place to sleep	The exterior of the hotel is very nice. I've attached a photo to this review. It's hit and miss with some of the staff tho. The gentleman who checked us in was very friendly, personable and helpful, but the morning clerk was about as disinterested as one could be. Our shower actually stuck in the ON position and for the life of us, we couldn't turn it off. The morning clerk seemed quite put out that he had to turn it off for us. He even struggled to get it turned off  then acted as if we were silly for not being able to do it ourselves. The shower drain was rather backed up too which made us worry about the overflow. Oddly, the bathroom is raised a few inches off the main room floor. We stubbed our toes a few times until we got used to it. But if the shower overflows, your room will get wet.Our room was the tiniest hotel room I had EVER stayed in anywhere. Just about enough room for a twin bed, and that's pretty much it. (See the photo with this review.) The bathroom seemed modern and clean, but it was quite tiny as well. Large people would do well to steer clear of this hotel. But we didn't book it for the amenities, we just wanted a cheap place near London. And that's pretty much what we got.We might stay there again, but will try to look for something a little roomier."
12,941,"Apr 8 2009 	Average hostel	I have been to this hotel in late March, it is very very close to tube, can reach the tube within 2 minutes, and there are many fastfood restaurant for selection (Such as KFC, Burger King (recently renovated due to rat problem), McDonald, Sub-way and so on). There is also free wifi. Yet the room is extremely small, not enough to have a luggage box fully opened. There is also a strong smell of mold from the carpet."
13,941,"Mar 29 2009	Disappointed	I had booked the Lord Jim as a week end away birthday treat for my daughter's 25th birthday. Initially, I had mixed feelings after reading reviews and with hindsight, I should have heeded them. The hotel photos look cosy and inviting and great value for money, but this was not our experience.On arrival, the male receptionist was very courteous and pleasant and checked us in speedily as we were loaded with bags etc. we were given our key and room number, but not directed to it's whereabouts. We found it, It was broom cupboard no.3 behind reception at the front of the hotel. I had booked a twin room, as I didn't think my grown up daughter would want to 'share with mummy', but she had no choice as it was a double bed not twin, and the hotel had no other rooms available. We laughed it off and decided to make the most of our cupboard. We went out for a meal, as there are a good selection of reastaurants, bars and cafes all within 2 minutes walking distance of the hotel. Returned to our room at 10pm and were unable to watch tv as it is a flat screen high on the wall above the bathroom door, however, you could see the picture if you stood by the window! We were unable to get to sleep because of the high level of noise (laughing, screaming, shouting etc) coming from the room below us, I finally reported this to reception at midnight. The same receptionist from earlier said he would sort it and advised me to call from our room if I needed him again. By 3am, still noisy and still no sleep, I tried to call reception and the phone didn't work! Back to reception in my PJ's, again I reported the noise from below our room, again I was told it would be sorted. No apology was received at either time. The noise still continued. Finally got to sleep somewhere about 4am, so if you are a nightowl, or out most of the night, this shouldn't be a problem. However, if you need to sleep in, this isn't possible either due to traffic noise, doors slamming around the hotel etc.Breakfast was basic, but fresh......O.J, toast, croissants, cereal, fruit bowl, coffee was excellent - something needed to be be!On checking out, met another male receptionist who was also courteous and polite and let us leave our luggage at the hotel to be collected later."
14,941,"Mar 11 2009	Nicegood value for money	Stayed for 5 nights in triple room.Small but clean,bathroom very small but clean and nice hot shower.People complaining about breakfast most probably not used to anything better at home,we enjoyed a good breakfast every morning.Will go back in future and recommend to friends,good value for money"
15,941,"Jan 18 2009 	It wasnt as bad as I was expecting...	I wasn't too keen on going to this place after reading the reviews on here, but the others I was going to london with, were fine with it, so it was booked.It wasn't as bad as I was expecting. The room seemed clean enough, and I didn't see any beasties. The room and bathroom were small. And the room was very hot. We arrived late in the evening, in December, and when we entered our room, it was roasting hot. And that was with the window open. We closed the window to keep the beasties out and went out for something to eat. The next day, the heat in the room didn't seem so bad...Overall, it was OK. But I wouldn't book it again, incase I wasn't so lucky next time and got a different room that wasn't as nice..."
16,941,"Dec 7 2008 	fire doors	enjoyed weekend ,front of hotel really inviting and clean, but our room was downstairs, it was no.33 triple room, the view of the courtyard could have been pleasant but instead bags of rubbish were to be seen, and out side our bedroom door we had bags of the hotel laundry which stunk to high heaven not one bag but twelve bags of it within a foot of our door!!! Our main problem was the noise at 0700hrs as the kitchen staff came on duty, both mornings we were woken by them, even though I had advised reception the night before, if only we had been told where the room was situated we would certainly have changed rooms, also I was concerned about the fire doors being fastened back, the main ones being by the laundry outside our room and the very close proximity of the kitchen, three times I took the cord of these doors so that they could be closed, also the fire doors by reception were fastened back, I questioned the practise and was told that they just put the blue stickers on but they did not mean anything!!!"
17,941,"Nov 30 2008 	Acceptable Hotel	I ended up at the Lord Jim Hotel quite by accident when The Cromwell Hotel had overbooked me and made arrangements to send me to the Lord Jim. The French receptionist, I wish I knew his name, was absolutely terrific and comforting. The room and bathroom were pretty decent, but plain. The bathroom did not have a bathtub, just a shower. The hotel is pretty close to the Earls Court Tube stop."
18,941,"Oct 29 2008 	Very disappointing	The front entry and the common room (tv, internet, coffee/tea room) are very well presented &amp; inviting. Very obliging &amp; friendly staff member at reception on our arrival day allowed us to check into our room very early rather than the usual 2pm. Our triple room was very small even for London's standard. I was expecting small but this was much worse &amp; quite dark &amp; drabby. First things first after a long night on a plane...a shower, which proceeded to backup..blocked drain! Advised staff, went out for breakfast, on our return we're moved to an even smaller room! This was on the very top floor &amp; was more like an attic room with positively no room to move. I'm sure it was a storage room before they decided to throw some beds in it. I requested a better room, stated we were prepared to pay more but nothing avail. The linen was of very poor standard (old prickly blankets) Terrible ventilation, quite stuffy, like sleeping in a wardrobe! Accomodation incl. breakfast which was very much below standard. Cereal, juice, foul coffee, cold tea, one only choice of fruit (orange) for the entire 4 sittings we had. Plastic cheese, no cold meat, no eggs. But they did bring to your table fresh toast &amp; jam.Of course location is excellent...just around the corner from tube &amp; buses. At $800 + Australian dollars for the 4 nights, I expected better accomodation. I would NEVER stay here again."
19,941,"Jul 10 2008 	A nice stay and excellent value for money!	Once a year I go to London on holidays. This was the first time I went with my parents and my sister and we really enjoy the stay in the hotel.We booked a quad room via internet and everybody was so happy with the price and the place!The hotel is located in Earls Court, two minutes walking from the tube and easy to find and there are a lot of restaurants and several supermarkets around.The room was not very big but its normal when there are 4 people with 4 suitcases, handbags and everybody clothes around. The bedding was ok, there was a small tv, a hair-dryer and a kettle for tea and coffee and almost every day we had clean towels...Everything was clean, the commune areas, the dinning room, our own room and the inside bathroom...We specially enjoy the breakfast. You could have cereals, toasts, buns and croissants, coffee, two different sort of juices and fresh fruit!The receptionists were so friendly. Every day after our journey around the city they ask where did we go, what we are going to do the next day, they even recommend us more places to go!The unique inconvenient we had was the first night we stay, the water tanker was a little bit noisy because it was flowing water but in the morning I told one of the receptionist and when we came back the problem was sorted out.On November I am planning another trip to London with my boyfriend, so if they can give me a good price I will go there for sure!"
20,941,"May 6 2008 	Convenient Lord Jim	For a european hotel, I can't complain about the Lord Jim. If you need a huge space to lounge around this is not the place for you, but if you're going to be sightseeing and not spending much time in the room, its close and convenient to a tube station, clean and has a standard european breakfast. The price is average for the area and not one to complain about, especially so close to central london."
21,941,"Mar 20 2008 	Just say no	Horrible. First, I checked in and the linens had not been changed and the room had not been cleaned. They promised to clean the room for me so I left to go to the British Museum. I came back and the linens were changed, but I saw 2 bugs in the room that may have been a type of roach but I can't be sure. They moved me to a different room that was a bit cleaner so it was a bit better.One day I went down to leave for sightseeing and a man and his son was arguing with the owner because they had apparently had the same problem. The hotel staff did nothing to help the guy and they don't know the meaning of customer service and from what I heard, the guy had some valid points that I had noticed as well. The customer even pleaded for my backup, but since I still had a couple of nights left of my trip and the hotel had my credit card info (they do seem kind of shifty there as another person mentioned) I didn't want to peeve anyone off. The breakfast area is so small that I did not get breakfast some days. There was a family of 3 eating at a 4 person table and the staff just plopped my bowl for cereal down at the table with the family. I felt awkward intruding on their conversation so I ate in my toast while standing up and vowed to eat McDs for breakfast by the tube station. In short, it was horrible. No service, no cleanliness, and I just had an uneasy feeling about the place. I locked my luggage every day before I went out because I had heard a couple of other posters on thes boards say that they had stuff stolen. Nothing of mine was stolen, but just trust me...get to breakfast early, bring a can of bug spray and some cleaning wipes, and take steps to secure your stuff."
22,941,"Feb 28 2008	AWFUL	This hotel is a joke. We got to the hotel early and were allowed to leave our bags. We returned at the time to chcek in only to be told they had no rooms? A complete lack of organisation and very suspiscious. We were told the previous occupants had not checked out so we could not have the room. Surely, we have priority over the room we booked for that night? We had no choice but to stay in a hotel opposite after spending hours searching for a suitable hotel in the first place. Very disappointed and could have potentially ruined our weekend."
23,941,"Jan 15 2008 	just to get your head down...	We were going to a wedding in shepherds bush and were looking for something nearby that was a little cheaper then the 80 chain hotels in the area.The Lord Jim was just 50 for a double room ...bargain. For that price and such a decent location (few steps away from earls court tube) there had to something wrong right? ...well, the rooms were tiny ... but we just didn't find this a problem in our circumstances. It was clean, good service, bathroom small but fine, great brekkie as part of price, didn't mind our late check in ... and as somewhere to just sleep... perfik. If you're a large space snob ...steer clear ...if you're willing to compromise space for a 30 discount. Book."
24,941,"Jan 14 2008 	Better than expected	Okay the decorating leaves a bit to be desired and the rooms are small ... but be reasonable. This is a budget hotel that delivers comfortable beds, hot showers and breakfast inclusive rates.I had room 2. It was tiny, but at the back so quiet. Fresh, crisp sheets, 24 hour reception (in London for a party) and friendly breakfast staff with fresh toast. Nice guy on reception too.Would I go back - yes."
25,941,"Dec 3 2007 	loved the lord jim	we had a lovely weekend in the lord jim. it is a lovely clean hotel with good service from all members of staff. room was small but had all we needed. location excellent. facilties good with tea making, television, phone, hairdryer and clean towels and complimentary toiletries. breakfast was toast, croissants, juice, fresh fruit, tea coffee and cereal. we would recommend it for a stay in london"
26,941,"Oct 4 2007 	You couldn't pick somwhere worse to stay!	I'm not on to normally complain about a hotel - but this one is beyond bad!the two good points about this hotel are that it's in a great location. and it has an elevator (too bad about the flight of steps at the front - they will watch you struggle with your luggage)4 mins walk from earls court. but thats all. there's a lot of other hotels with a similarly great location! starting with check-in. i handed over my wotif booking. they proceeded to tell me they had never heard of it, and my booking wasn't valid. 15 minutes later, the check in man finally asked his manager who said, yes, i could stay, but i should call wotif as the booking wasn't valid.i had to pay again before they would give me access to my room. not happy!kudo's to wotif, who i then called &amp; they fixed it up in about 2 minutes.i recieved a phone call in my room to 'come down now'. they then gave me a refund.the room's are tiny, grubby, and in need of a refurb. the linen is stained which is very scary.neither the tv or hairdryer in my room worked (which the reception man found funny...and then said he couldn't fix)the shower is appalling. you get about 3 mins of warm water &amp; then it turns off. for about 3 mins - not fun when you are trying to wash your hair!the 'free' wifi dosen't work at all. so you'll pay a minimum 10 pounds per 24 hours to use another wifi service.i would recommend people stay absolutely anywhere then there. there are similarly priced hotels (such as best western where i am now), around that are around the same price, and far better in standard."
27,941,"Jul 21 2007 	Not bad at all	I was a bit uneasy during booking cause I had read several negative reviews about this hotel on the net but I had very limited time left and honestly had no much other choice to make so I booked online and went. I have stayed there for a week and can say that it was much better than I have expected .First the positive sides: The location is in a very close walking distance to tube station (Earls Court) and is in a convenient,safe area. There are several eating places (fast food /rest /cafe )and supermarkets around in case you need.The bathroom was very small but it was quite new&amp;clean.The room/bed was also clean.The towels were provided and though not everyday,they were changed from time to time.As to negative sides: The room is really small-not much place to place your stuff and even walk. Sheets were not changed during this one week.The street where the hotel is located,can be sometimes noisy at nights (other many hotels and people around) and since in warm weathers the window is open, this may be a bit distrubing at nights.Similary if the people in the hotel are the noisy and &quot;door-banging&quot; types,you may hear those as well.The breakfast hours were quite early (7:30-9:00) and the breakfast room was very small.In order to find a place, you had to go quite early-which was not very preferable for me after walking all day in the city.One other thing ,before going there I had sent an e-mail to the hotel to confirm my booking and had no reply from them at all -which I found unprofessional.Anyway, I think that from this level hotels (2-3 stars/ b&amp;b) in London ,you shouldn't expect much. Yes,they are pricy (compared to the service) but still can't be compared with global standards. Therefore if it is clean and central that should be ok -at least that was all my expectation and I can say that Lord Jim was quite ok in that sense.However if you are looking for some more quality and comfort I'd suggest to go for at least 4-star hotels.Hope that helps!"
28,941,"Jul 6 2007	Cleanliness needs great improvement	The location &amp; price is why I chose this hotel. Located at Earls Court Tube Station(3mins walk) is along the Piccadilly Line(=direct line to Heathrow) and among the few stations that has handicap access(=with elevators=luggage friendly).View from room window is of quiet tree-lined neighbourhood(not bad!). Hotel has a tiny lift to most floors(=luggage friendly). Room and toilet is very small. The room itself seemed ok at first look with new wallpaper &amp; new bathroom fittings. But the cleaniness was horrible. The toilet walls and door are smeared with toothpaste???, fingersmudges and other ??? stuffs. The shower cubicle's floor and the wash basin were slimy. Shower very weak. The bed-linen was moldy when bedcover and blanket was pulled away coz rather warm and w/o air-conditioning in room. The phone and remote control were sticky with orange juice or sth.Cleaniness is the most important factor when choosing a hotel. I sincerely hope they can improve as their other factors are not that bad."
29,941,"Nov 27 2006 	Visit to Natural History Museum	Location is great, hotel terrible. Booked a room for five for three nights. When we arrived we were told this room was out of action-even though I had phoned on the morning to check arrangements. Told we had to have two rooms. Our children are only young-so this was a total inconvenience. One room reasonable, the other had a really unpleasant smell. After moving a set of drawers found a mouse poison trap. Hence the smell. Moved us after complain after one night. Windows opened fully onto a three storey drop-so we had to suffer the smell, or risk death by falling. Had paid up front so no recourse."
30,941,"Nov 26 2006 	Concert convenience	Bearing in mind recent reviews went with some trepidation. Should not have worried, excellent location to the Earls Court tube station and the Centre. Receptionist pleasant and check in/out was smooth. Room was bijou, but warm and clean with great shower. Breakfast was absolutely fine with efficient service (quick tip get in close to 8am rather than 8.30 when it gets very busy, as room is small)Overall a no frills, positive experience which was excellent value made better by a magnificent performance from George Michael.."
31,941,"Aug 4 2006	Not recommended	This hotel has you pay up front for your entire stay, with no refunds. After staying there I can see why! The room was worn, with torn wallpaper, hole in the carpet, musty odor, etc. Sheets and towels were clean, as was the bathroom. No air conditioning. Most of staff were quite helpful, but a few were grumpy. Breakfast was minimal. The location is quite convenient to the Underground and a variety of pubs and restaurants.Basically you get the quality of a Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn at 3 times the price. Not awful, but if you shop you can find much better for the money."
32,941,"Jul 26 2006 	Be very wary of this place!	Warning, stay away from this hotel!. I booked on travelstay(-) for a single room in July. When I turned up at the Lord Jim reception I was told that I was actually booked in to another hotel owned by the same people. So I walked to the Court Hotel on Earls Court Road and found it to be a door with a shabby awning over it between two shops. When I checked in my room was tiny, but clean and comfortable apart from the noisy road and a window that didn't close properly. Needless to say I didn't get much sleep because of sirens and other traffic noise. There was a sink in the room with a hot water unit on the wall but with no tap coming from it so actually no use. One of the communal showers was also broken. In the morning was the worst part though, I went down for breakfast expecting the continental breakfast promised at the Lord Jim. Instead I was faced with a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; kitchen where there was white bread for toast and margarine and jam on the table. To make things worse there was hair in the margarine. The &quot;chioce&quot; of drinks was instant coffee or tea bags. As I don't eat white bread I was unable to eat breakfast at the hotel. Guests were also expected to wash their own dishes after they had used them! Even if brown bread had been on offer I doubt I would have eaten in that kitchen at all.So if you so book to stay at the Lord Jim Hotel but are told when you arrive that you are actually staying in the Court Hotel don't go there. Fight for the room you have booked in the Lord Jim on the quiet side road with a full continental breakfast. I found out later that the Court Hotel is infact registered as a hostel, not a 2* hotel. This is called misrepresentation and is illegal. I paid to stay in a 2* hotel and ended up in a hostel!"
33,941,"Jun 29 2006	Home sweet closet	My family stayed at Lord Jim's last summer. We would not stay there again. We called it &quot;home, sweet closet&quot; for four days. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls. The only way to reach the sink was by sitting on the end of the bed. My dad's knees hit the bathroom door when he sat on the toilet. It has to be admitted, though, that the breakfast was very good. We loved the tea. But it's London; you can find good tea somewhere else."
34,941,"Jun 27 2006	Good Deal and Convenient Location!	Our stay at the Lord Jim was everything we expected and hoped for in a hotel of this class. We live in Europe and are frequent global travelers and London is a favorite destination of ours. We've stayed in places that were a disgarce compared to the Lord Jim, paying more for a room and dealt with rude, incompetent staff, unclean rooms, etc at some of those other places- the Central Park Hotel in Bayswater comes to mind- (It was awful)...but not so at the Lord Jim! The experience with this hotel and its convenient location was pleasant and a GREAT deal for the money. True, the breakfast room is small, but we surmounted that in part by arriving as early as possible, for one thing. More of a problem was that when we arrived each day, some of the guests were reluctant or refused to share open seating at the communal tables with folks they didn't know. For instance, virtually every time we went to breakfast, there would be 1 or 2 people taking up a table with 4 seats, and much grumbling if we asked if we could use their available, unused seats. Come on, it won't kill anyone to share a table with strangers for a half hour or so. People sit next to strangers at lunch and cafe/bar counters all of the time, don't they? And though the breakfast spread would not rival that of the Ritz Carlton, it was certainly of an adequate quality. Coffee, tea, juice, rolls, croissants, creals, hard boiled eggs, toast, jam, butter and fruit, exactly what I'd expect at a hotel in this class. The breakfast room staff stayed right on top of things and were quite accommodating. Our double-bedded room was very small, but we expected that as well for this hotel category- it was clean, well-provisioned, and comfortable. That's all we require, especially since we're not even in our hotel room most of the time while touring. But it makes it that much nicer when the room you return to after a day of sightseeing and exploring is cozy and clean. Our room there was always clean and well-kept.. The LJ is located on a lovely, quiet street. The staff in the reception area were always friendly, patient and helpful during the course of our stay. There is Internet service in the vicinity of the reception area, as well as snack vending machines. Continental breakfast was included with room price. A big plus is the close proximity to the Earl's Court tube station- just a short stroll away, and also there are quite a few shops, pubs and eateries nearby.We wouldn't hesitate to book at the Lord Jim again, it passed all of our expectations for the price range and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay."
35,941,Oct 13 2005	Very pleasant stay!	I had previously read some bad reviews on this website and was worried what my stay would be like. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were very friendly and very helpful. Our family room was ample size. The accommodation was basic but that was what we paid for. The room was clean and all the facilities described were available. We were provided with clean towels each day and the bathroom was also cleaned daily. Staying at the Lord Jim made our first stay in London as a family very enjoyable and we would definitely stay there again. The location was excellent for travel around London.
36,941,"May 23 2005	Nice people bad room	Booked over the internet 1 double room with bathroom. When I came , no such room was available although already paid. Instead I got a room, more like a corridor 2 beds in the lenghts of the room. A shower was inside, but using it made the floor al wet ( damp and smelly air in the room) since the door was fixed with insulation tape. This seemed an old problem since parts of the floor were rotten and just failed.The ad promised a new hotel and I found an old one. The people at the desk were nice and friendly. The russian's who did the breakfast not. The breakfast was : coffee, toast, slice of cheese. I asked for juice buth got a simple &quot;finished!&quot;.The area of the hotel is nice, and good connected. Next time I would consider a stay there, but find a hotel in the same area myself since the whole street had vacancies."
37,941,"Apr 4 2005	I will stay at the Lord Jim again	I brought a group of 25 college and faculty to London for spring break and we stayed at the Lord Jim for five nights. Our experience there was perfectly acceptable. Be prepared for small rooms, but that's London. They were a bit traveler worn, but exceptionally clean. Most significantly, most of the staff members are clearly &quot;first class&quot; in their friendliness and concern about our stay---in fact, the service staff is above average compared to the majority of hotels I have stayed in the U.S. and I have traveled quite a bit. Omar and Pascal, evening staff, were especially helpful. The breakfast was plentiful. We felt very safe in the Earl's Court area and the Lord Jim is just around the corner from the Piccadilly, District and Circle Lines. Overall, we had a positive stay and I would stay there again. Anneliese from the U.S."
38,941,"Jan 6 2005	Yuk!!	Don't even think about it. Had the misfortune to stay there on a recent business trip. No hot water in the morning, no apology and no decrease on bill. All in all a truly miserable experience. Plenty of other good hotels in the area. Don't stay at the Lord Jim!"
39,941,"Oct 11 2004	Lord Jim was ok for the money	The lord Jim was ok. Easy to get to from the Earls Court Tube station and close to busses.Room (there were 3 of us a family) had a double bed and a single. The bathroom was very small. Your knees almost touch the door when sitting on the toilet and the shower is small. The sink is in the main part of the room not in the bathroom. (We had to sit on the single bed to use the sink).Breakfast was toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee, juice, cereal, crossants and fruit. You aren't limited on how much you eat.I feel that we got a decent value since we did stay at one of the cheapest places in town! And the rooms were clean. And yes the walls are kind of thin and the floors do squeak but in the evening everyone was quite so we didn't have any noise problems at all."
40,941,"Sep 7 2004	Good clean rooms	Good clean rooms for the price with a friendly warm welcome, would recommend this hotel if you need to stay in earls court. ."
41,941,"Jul 24 2004	A Dump!	Can't even imagine what it was like before it was remodeled!!! Paint peeling, wall paper hanging off the wall, no toilet lid, and the bed sinks in the middle like a banana. There are about 20 other hotels on this same nice street, any would be better!"
42,941,"Jun 26 2004	Bad hotel in good location	Room was so small you couldn't close the bathroom door when you sat on the toilet, and you had to climb over the toilet to get into the shower. Pillows so flat we had to use our clothing under them, and bed sagged so badly we were joined at the hip and miserable. Location is good but there are a ton of hotels in the area. Find a different one!"
43,941,"Jun 25 2004	OK but wouldn't go again.	The entrance lobby fills you with hope. Marble floors and surfaces, a chandelier and clean, shiny mirrors. Nearby, there's a small lounge which is inviting to an extent. The seats are a little uncomfortable but the tv is a good size, the internet computer is only 7p a minute and there's coffee and drinks machines as well.Once you get up the stairs, things begin to change. You begin to realise the owners spent a lot on the entrance lobby, but the rest of the hotel has been let be. Toilet and Shower facilities are less than impressive and the floors creak so much, you worry you might be waking everyone up. That doesn't matter though, because the other guests will return to favour into the small hours with noise from their TVs and general nattering. The walls are direct from the set of Fawlty Towers. If you didn't see it, the walls shock when you closed the door or if you sneezed, they were that thin.The two rooms I saw both had sinks in them, directly next to the bed which was a bit wierd. Nonetheless, you also got a towel, soap, a tv (fuzzy but with some digital channels) and a telephone (mine didn't work). Rooms are a good size, but you do get a 'bedsit' feeling from them. Beds themselves could pass as being comfortable. One night would be enough.Overall, the Lord Jim is an average hotel. You get what you pay for. Other than the lobby, it is in need of modernisation. If you just want a bed for one night in a good location and don't want to spend more than 40, the Lord Jim is for you."
44,941,"Mar 30 2004	Stay Away From This Place!	Broken floors in filthy bath. No hot water, and the management would not lower the room charge (75 GBP per night) for this horrible condition. Paper thin walls (noisy)."
45,941,"Mar 4 2004	Could take it or leave it	Worst part - rooms definitely not like the pictures. Wall paper coming off, lime covering the shower head, malfunctioning toilets, flat pillows, blankets in fray.Best part - nice staff, good location."
46,941,"Feb 20 2004 	group-trip to lord jim hotel	We stayed in the hotel from Feb 5th to Feb 8th with a group of 24 students. The rooms were small, but clean, all had showers. The breakfast was definitely above average - including boiled egg, fresh fruit, cheese and ham - very friendly and helpful staff; good location - close to Earls Court underground station, good food-place closeby (Dino's) and nice pub on the main road. Would come again any time."

48,941,"Dec 17 2003	Good value	Stayed for two nights at the Lord Jim. Our room was tiny but very reasonable, at 50GBP per night for two beds with toilet and shower ensuite. Pros: Quiet street, very convenient (two-minute maximum walk to Earl's Court tube station), on Piccadilly line so easy to get to &amp; from Heathrow, pleasant staff, lounge where my mom could hang out while she waited for our room to be ready upon arriving early. Good value for the money.Cons: Breakfast just mediocre (toast, hard-boiled egg, cornflakes, orange juice, croissants, american cheese slices, mystery meat cold cuts) but fortifying. TV in room didn't work."

The rooms where very clean
16,942,Aug 3 2007 	Feel I was cheated	Us 5 girlfriends booked a 5 bedded suite off of the Lord Kensington website but when we arrived the owner told us that we could not stay in that room that it was ment for families. Then he told us that we could put a cot in one of the supposed 4 bedded rooms (so tiny) or we could get two rooms and that he would work us a deal. My thought is we booked that 5 bedded suite so what does it matter that we were not a family! I really feel that he was taking us for a ride so he could get more money out of us. He keep saying &quot;I'm a nice guy

3,951,"Jan 2 2008 	Is in the process of a much needed refurbishment	I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for New Years Eve. The hotel is in a excellent location, and the building is beautiful. Upon arrival we were greeted by two gentlemen, who were very pleasant and helpful. They informed us that they had only recently taken over the hotel and that it needed a lot of work. We were given a small room with a double bed and shower. The shower was clean and so were the bedsheets, however, the carpet was very dirty and the wallpaper was dated. Considering we only paid 45 for the night, we had no need to complain. We missed the breakfast in the morning, but checking out was easy and the jorney to the nearest tube was quick.I would only recommend this hotel for one night, and would advise the customer not to expect much. However, for a cheap hotel in london, it was not too bad. The other reviews that have been written are fair, but please remember that the hotel has changed hands recently and the new owners are trying their best to make the hotel better."
4,951,"Nov 27 2007 	Oh my God how disgusting!!!	This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in - no hot water, no plug in the sink (so we went home as dirty as the hotel after 2 nights!), furniture crammed into a tiny room, no tea/coffee facilities, TV broken, and on a 1 meter!The sheets were ripped and I couldn't sleep for fear the dirty bedspread and prison issue blanket would touch me!The hotel smelt, but they had poured super strong loo cleaner down the toilet to try &amp; cover the smell.On the Sunday morning someone was doing some building work downstairs &amp; smashing windows led to us leaving early to find breakfast - we couldn't face the dining room in case it was as bad as the rest of the hotel!I used to live in London, and this hotel just sums up all the worst things you hear about being ripped off when you stay in the capital. Never again &amp; certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,951,"Nov 2 2007 	disguting room sleazy staff	The only and I mean the only good thing about this hotel is its location.The shared facilities were out of order, we had paid extra for an 'en suite' if that is what you could call it.The toilet was disgusting so much so we could not bring ourselves to take a picture I would not be exagarating to say it had never been cleaned.The shower was coverd in mold as we checked out before using it I could not say whether it worked or not but it would take someone braver than me to try it.The bedsheets were dirty as were the pillows even the free standing wardrobe had a pong.The staff were dissenteresred at best and actually had the audacity to reprimand us for not asking for another room when we informed them we were checking out due to the state of repair.DO NOT STAY HERE!"
6,951,"Nov 1 2007 	Hotel from Hell	We couldn't even bear to stay one night in this filthy hotel. We checked in, and checked straight back out again after just a few hours. The hotel has shared facilities, which were out of order when we arrived. We had booked an en suite room so we had our own shower and toilet. However, i would not want to use the shower and toilet, as they were absolutely disgusting, and looked like they had never been cleaned. The bedsheets were clean, but the extra pillows in the cupboard were badly stained, and were a horrible brown colour. The tv in the room was on a metre! There was a kettle and cups in the room...however, no tea or coffee!The carpet was disgusting and was in desperate need of a vacuum. When we left we told the staff member on duty why we were leaving and that we had to find somewhere else to stay. He had a bad attitude and seemed like he really did not care. He did offer another &quot;clean&quot; room but if the room we were in was anything to go by, i did not want to spend a moment longer in that hotel.WARNING: DO NOT STAY HERE! :("
7,951,"Oct 9 2007 	Words can't explain how disgusting this place is	This hotel is the most vile place I have ever had the misfortune of staying. I have just spent a month backpacking around Thailand on a tight budget and I can honeslty say that the Manor Court was worse than anywhere I stayed when I was traveling. The staff are unfriendly and incompetent. Guests are required to leave their key at the front desk when they leave the hotel, and despite not having been informed of this I was reprimanded like a naughty child for not leaving my key.Breakfast consists of a pile of bread, some cheap cartons of orange juice and tea making facilities. Only 'served' between the hours of 7.30 and 8.30 it is best avoided.I can't say enough bad things about the rooms. There are wretch-worthy stains all over the walls, lampshades, carpets and linen. Nothing has been updated for decades. The bathroom smells absolutely disgusting - something which the owners are obviously aware of since they have gone to great efforts to place a cheap can of air freshener in the cell-like en suite. The shower curtain is mouldy, and quite fankly you'd get a more thorough wash by standing outside in the rain with a bottle of shampoo.The heating doesn't work and so even if you can manage to come to terms with lying under the rancid sheets you still wouldn't get a decent night's sleep as the room is so cold. Sadly, there are far too many hotels in London like this. Next time I have to find accomodation in Londonl I will stick to the big hotel chains."
8,951,"Oct 8 2007 	A sensory assault	If hygiene is your thing, stay away from the Manor Court. The hotel is offensive to each of the five senses; it looks vile, it smells vile, the breakfast tastes vile, the threadbare, bloodstained blankets made my skin crawl and we were kept awake all night by the noise of other guests who had turned to the bottle to numb their senses.The ensuite bathroom was a real treat. It was comprised of an archaic 'suite', a dribbling shower that wasn't attached to the wall and a free standing plank of wood manifesting itself as a door. The 'door' had to be lifted and lodged into place over the doorway by a secondary party when someone desired use of the hovel that was the bathroom.Inexplicable sticky brown stains adorned the walls, lampshades and carpets, the curtains were unattached to the railings and the radiator hung loose from the wall so we shivered at night because in hell, there is no heating . However, my favourite feature was unquestionably the little black pest- controller located under the sink. Strategically placed, I think, to offer a quick and humane death to any unfortuate specimen of vermon that may have found itself victim to the sensory assault that is the Manor Court. Sadly our suffering was a more prolonged affair; a five night agony to be more precise. I have been through some hard things in my life; the Manor Court was the hardest. No matter what you have done in your life, you probably don't deserve the Manor Court."

10,951,"Aug 14 2007	Avoid if at all possible	We stayed here for one night. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. The place is filthy, the facilities primitive, and the entire property has been allowed to become severely run down through lack of maintenance and upgrading. (Examples: an upstairs toilet - WC - has no latch or door handle, the floor in the bedroom is wobbly and broken, bedspread is dirty, the toilets are dirty and the shower hose is broken and lying in the tub). Needless to say, we were out at the first light of morning. This kind of thing seems to be possible only because the visitor accommodations situation in London is so grim."
11,951,"Jun 16 2007 	Worst hotel i have ever stayed in!	Myself and my mother booked into the hotel for one night as we were attending a training course. The hotel was truly awful. Really dirty, the dust was about 6 inches thickon the stairs. The bedrooms hadnt been decorated in at least 50 years, no joke! The wallpaper was coming off the wall, the sink was hanging off, the windows were cracked and dirty and the bathroom door was hanging off. They gave us a key for another room to use the shower as ours didnt work, but that room didnt have a window and stank. we're not really fussy people but this was really bad. we didnt risk the breakfast the next morning as it was at the very bottom of the hotel in a 'dungeon' like room. The boy on the front desk was about 12 and wasnt helpful at all and a bit scary really. Only for the fact that we would only be in the room for about 10 hours we would have found somewhere else! Dont stay there unless your used to living in a dump!"
12,951,"Mar 20 2007 	typical ""cheap"" London hotel	ive stayed at the manor court twice in the last couple of years. basically looking for the cheapest room possible in the rip off capital that is London. the hotels in a decent location 5 min walk from the tube. Other than that its your typcial cheap B&amp;B. kinda like the regent palace dont look under the beds mucky carpet, just usable bathrooms. the kinda place where they are counting the profits from their many rooms but certainly not putting the money into doing the place up. we had problems with no hot water when we were there. but as its basically a place to sleep and you are out of the room 12hrs of the day its does its job. if you are young and just want somewhere to sleep while out and about and want to spend as little as possible then its ok. but if u want anything that is slightly near 3* dont bother. considering i payed the same amount, 25 a night for the amazing alloro hotel in florence to what i payed a night for manor court it makes me wonder why anyone wants to go to London anyway."
13,951,"Mar 14 2006	Terrible Hotel!	This hotel is terrible! Dirty,dark,cold ( no heating) We was in the hotel 2 minutes. That was enough. The London house hotel forwarded us to this hotel, becouse they have some problem with room renovating. But after we told this terrible hotel, they give us a very nice flat."
14,951,"Apr 5 2004	perfect for a cheap stay	This was the perfect cheap hotel. We paid 50 pounds/night and got a big room with 2 beds and breakfast (just toast and juice). The family who runs it was SO helpful and friendly--very eager to please. The Manor Court is in a great location, we took the tube there and from the hotel, the bus on the corner will take you anywhere. Closer to the city it was loud and dirty, but this part of Notting Hill was quiet, quaint, and close to a beautiful park. This is by no means luxury, but of all the three places we stayed in London, this was by far the best deal."

1,956,Sep 20 2009 	Great Service	The hotel is within walking distance of Victoria Train Station yet set in quiet surroundings. The rooms and private bathroom were sort of plain but clean and good-sized. English breakfast served. Pricewise quite reasonable.Family run hotel with very friendly staff providing a good service all around.
2,956,"May 26 2009 	disgusting	i was booked into this hotel by my company and from the moment i stepped in the door i was appalled. The state of the rooms was disgusting.to call the room en-suite is a joke, the room was literally 2 foot by 6 foot, a bed is bigger. The bathroom door was rotting away and down the side of the toilet were faeces. The telly was literally hanging off the old wooden cladded wall which wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't above the single bed. On arrival to the hotel the owner/manager would only accept cash even though the room had been secured by the company credit card, so i informed him that because i had been at work i only had enough cash on me to pay for one night. He said this wasn't a problem just settle up when we collected our invoice and handed in our keys.After work on the second day (we only stayed two days) i went out for tea and not being able to put up with the room any more, only to return with the lady manager and another lady searching my belongings and my colleagues belongings in order to find some valuables which they said was to hold ransom until we paid, even though they had the company credit card.The grand finale is that on the day we left i discovered i have at least 15 big red bites all over my back, shoulders, face and hands. i hope that people read this review and other companies take note and do not simply put your employees in any old hotel"
3,956,"Dec 2 2007 	absolutely appaling!!!!	I was shocked and disgusted at this place. I regret not having looked at these previous reviews. This hotel is awful and the rude man who we dealt with greeted us with such disrespect and was extremely racist. I have never come across anything like this on my travels before and as a result my view of Londoners has been severely tainted and we just did not wish to be there any longer. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The decor was unsightly and nothing about it was aesthetically pleasing, nor was it clean. The only good thing about this hotel were the steps leading away from it."
4,956,"Nov 19 2007 	Bed bugs nightmare	I wish I or my friend who booked the hotel have read the review by &quot; WearyTravellerAgain&quot;, then we could have avoided the awful experience we have encountered. The review by &quot;WearyTravellerAgain&quot; has perfectly described the appearance of the Marne as we entered, non-functional flush in the toilet, one side of the taps is missing, filthy shower area that we even didn't want to stand our bared feet on. But all these are nothing compared with the extrodonary sences we later saw in the midnight. I was waken up feeling extremely itchy over my neck, face and even my hands. The moment when I switched on the light, it was an instant shock seeing more than 20 bed bugs running insides my bed!!! Some of them look extremely red as they have been well-fed by me. Similar situation in my friend's bed and we quickly packed our stuff and just wish we could run away from all the bugs. We went down to the reception and tried to ring the bell, it was 4am in the morning and no one answered. We tried to call the owner's mobile, again no success. However, we can clearly hear the woman working in the hotel talking with a man in their room (next to the reception), but they didn't come out despite we range the bell for half an hour. We drop the key in the keybox and left a message explaining the reason and requested a refund. The next day we tried several times to call the owner, but no feedback so far. Our weekend plan in London was ruined as we travelled back instantly that moring and had to wash all our clothes and cleaned all the belongings carefully ( as the bed bugs could transfer and spread anywhere). In the following few days, I had a cold and sore throat. Didn't relate it with the incident with the hotel but a week later since my stay in Marne, I had an outbreak of allergy. Lots of bite-like red spots appeared on my cheek, all over my neck and shoulder. I have got confirmed from my GP that it was very likely due to the bugs. I am very upset about my misfortune getting into this hotel, it was the most awful experience. I've stayed in many youth hostels (some are much cheaper than what we paid this time) before but I never got the luck to see the bed bugs, especially in such a quantity. I sincerely hope such misfortunate will not occur to any traveller. From my oponion, the status of this place is unbearable and they shouldn't be allowed to operate."
5,956,"Sep 4 2007	A Peace camp would be luxurious compared to this dump.......	I had the misfortune of having to stay in this dump. My employer booked my accomadation and on that basis I expect basic but clean and tidy. A travel lodge standard isn't asking too much. Before I went I was suspicious that nowhere can you see a picture of the interior of this hotel and no wonder. However I have that treat in store once I download the pics I took on my mobile. I took these primarily to complain to my employer that this hotel appears in my employers approved hotel list.Decor Appaling, 1970's dark wood panelling on parts of the wall, flaking wallpaper over painted in hideous blue. Lovely rust coloured stains on the ceiling from previous flooding from the room above. No wonder I think its the party suite for boozed up youngsters. TV with 20 foot of ariel cable that is stretched up to the TV. God knows why they bother with the ariel the TV picture is grim. One plug socker in the entire room, not even an adapater. Dust in as many layers as you fancy. Don't look on top of the cheap chip board wardrobe thats where the rubbish gets stored. Carpets throughout threadbare, cheap, worn and stained. Furniture is cheap nasty and ancient. Don't try to move the bed slightly it comes apart in your hands. This establishment charges way over the odds for the dire standards therefore the owners can surely aford something resembling furniture. Jesus even IKEA's stuff is chippendale quality compared to this place. Ensuite Should be called Ens*ite. Shower tray surrounded in thick layers of white mastic (sorry should be white , more a grimmy gunge colour). The tiles in the shower cabinet havent seen a dose of cleaner in long and weary. This is the grimmest place I have stayed in over 30 years of travelling, my only saviour was I didnt pay for it and if I have anything to do with it my company will never pay for anyone else to stay there.FoodI cannot comment on the food as the stomach churning room made me less than prepared to sample breakfast. I slept in a chair because I was not prepared to risk the bed on the basis of everything else I saw. Although I must say the linen and towles looked clean enough. Though the Iron doesnt seem to spread to the pillow cases so was hard to tell.The previous review has me baffled. Even on a stag weekend I would not go near this place with a bargepole. &quot;not somewhere to take your girlfriend or wife on a romantic weekend&quot; ???? I wouldn't board my dog there. I feel really sorry if any tourists from abroad ever have the misfortune to get this hotel. At least we brits are not surpised by the [--] in some places, the poor bloody foreigner has no chance."
6,956,"Dec 6 2006	Cheap Good Position - The Marne	I and my mates have stayed in the Marne tonnes of times, as it is cheap, lets groups of blokes in, its in a convinient place which is ouside the cogestion zone and just down the road from Victoria coach station.I am from bristol which makes this hotel very easy to commute to by road, also megabus go to Victoria too, there is always parking on the road outside(free after 6pm on Friday till 8am on Monday).However, the rooms are small but clean to be honest. Its not the sort of place you'd want to take your bird to but for a drinking weekend it is spot on.The breakfast in the morning is on the small size but is pretty good."

1,963,"Excellent Value for Money!	This hotel is ideally located with Kings Cross Station and underground on your doorstep. You can easily walk from Euston station too as it is a mere 10 minutes along the road. Also note that there is a burger king next to it (makes it a lot easier to find). The rooms itself are lovely and maintained to a very high standard. All rooms come with free tv and internet(via the tv) and each morning you are supplied with a newspaper of your choice which is also a nice touch. The bed's are very comfortable and the shower is excellent. Only slight problem was the heat of the room which was soon solved by asking reception to turn on the air conditioning. They also have a luggage room which is very handy if you have late flight/train. I would definitely recommend this hotel as it also has a Starbucks, Costa and Tesco nearby."
2,963,Nov 21 2009 	Very handy	Great location opposite Kings Cross for us northern types. Shower was the most amazing thing we've seen with jacuzzi built in. Proper coffee machine too. Seemed to be a bargain considering location and extra freebies. Bed was super confortable too!
3,963,"Nov 20 2009 	Lovely hotel and ideally located	I stayed with my partner and daughter in this hotel for a long weekend. We were really pleasantly suprised. It was great value for money and ideally located, being almost opposite Kings Cross.We had a family room which was extremely modern and clean. There was internet access via the TV - really useful for checking on places to visit. The restaurant is excellent and great value for money too. I particularly liked the friendly atttitude of all staff and it ahd a warm feel as it was a fairly small sized hotel.I do not normally write reviews but was so impressed, felt that I should!!"
4,963,"Nov 16 2009 	Perfect for Eurostar	Stayed at Megaro Hotel Friday 13th November. Perfect position for connecting to Eurostar. Rooms excellent, bed super comfy, little noisy at night but you are in London its to be expected. Expresso machine in room but degree needed to operate or i'm just not clever enough. Like previous reviewers small flood. If you need to use Eurostar and want a perfect place to sleep over then the Megaro is for you. Book you rate via hotel booking site, not direct with hotel."
5,963,"Nov 9 2009 	Excellent excellent excellent	What a find..thanks Trip Advisor! Superconvenient location across from Kings Cross and St Pancras and the place is so upscale and nice. We got a great weekend rate that included full English Breakfast and it was really fantastic. I never thought I'd find a hotel room in London so conveniently located with all the amenities this place has, but now I won't stay anywhere else. From Kings Cross you can pretty much get anywhere you want to go. Upon leaving we were able to walk across the street, get on the tube to Heathrow with our luggage and ride all the way there for under 3. Priceless :)"
6,963,"Nov 6 2009 	Hidden gem right across from the tube station.	Luckily I knew ahead of time that this hotel was located next to Burger King or else I may not have found it, but I'm glad I did find it. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. My room was big by European standards. I had no problems with the wireless keyboard and access to the Internet through the television. I had dinner one night in the hotel's restaurant--it was great!"
7,963,"Nov 3 2009	Cute  Clean 	We -a family of 2 adults,1 child and 1 infant-spent 4 days in London on our way back from Scotland, we got a good review from trip advisor about the hotel and we booked directly...... wonderfully placed just beside the king's cross tube.It is a clean , beautufully managed hotel and most important the size of the room is quite big (which is very rare in London city)....The hotel is on the main road with full of shops &amp; restaurant....every items in the room are in proper working condition and thoroughly cleaned / serviced.liked the hotel and the location very much....."
8,963,"Nov 2 2009 	Great hotel fantastic location	I sat at this hotel at elast once a month as I need to travel to London with work regularly. I now wont stay anywhere else but the Megaro. Its a perfect location and you feel very safe despite being in the hustle and buslte of Kings Cross.Great rooms with very comfy bed. All ameneities needed including TV, great bathroom, etc however no mini bar but there is a newsagent right next door.Last visit I was updgraded free of charge to the tp suite which was very big witha great veiw of London.Great hotel."
9,963,"Oct 17 2009 	Great value and convenience for London	Location is very convenient for King's Cross and St Pancras. This hotel is very updated and modern  almost Swedish, with wood floors and glass doors. Bonus for internet thru the TV screen  and check out the tons of CDs you can play thru the TV for music. Refrig in room. Tons of space (we were up on the 6th floor). We got a great 2-day weekend deal that included a full breakfast, which was very good. Security is terrific  everything is behind key access, so it's very safe there."
10,963,"Oct 10 2009 	Good hotel reasonably priced - but don't book through Expedia	Very nice hotel, right next to the steps as you come out of tube/station at Kings Cross. Everything in the hotel is modern and clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and the shower was great.Colleagues had worried about me staying at Kings Cross as they said it wasn't very safe and I was there as a female alone on a business trip, but with the hotel right at the top of the tube steps, i found it absolutely fine.I was worried that it might be noisy as the hotel is based right on the main road, but the hotel is well soundproofed so i found it fine. if you are super-sensitive to noise, i would ask for a room at the back of the hotel.The only issue i had was with my booking through Expedia. Expedia had quoted a price, which looked like the total but actually didn't include taxes. The only reference they made was to say 'Taxes may or may not be included in total'. This was completely misleading so i was less than happy when i went to check out and the price came to 125 rather than 108 as listed on the Expedia confirmation. I understand that this is not the hotel's fault however, on the hotel's own documentation from Expedia, it is listed much more clearly, but it is an issue they encounter all the time.As a result i have already booked to stay at the hotel again next week - but I have booked directly with the hotel this time and will avoid using Expedia again as they are misleading."
11,963,"Oct 7 2009 	A nice little surprise at King's Cross	My husband and I picked this hotel for a three night's stay for its location. We wanted to be on the Northern Line of the Underground so we could easily visit our daughter and son-in-law in Tufnell Park--a few stops away. King's Cross is udnergoing enormous rehab, so it is noisy and busy, but the hotel is an oasis of comfort and quiet. The rooms, although on the small side , are very nice and the beds are really comfortable. The bathroom is roomy and modern--the shower can take a little getting used to but it's fine thereafter. There is a first-floor restaurant and a sweet bar that's open late. Our one complaint is the in-room computer, which uses the television and a wireless keyboard, had problems while we were there. Still, we were very satisfied, especially given the reasonable price."
12,963,"Oct 5 2009 	Great rooms great location (for this part of London)	I stayed in a triple room with my parents (in their 70s) for one night and found this hotel great. My bed was a fold down one which appeared out of one of the wardrobes - I thought these only existed in the cartoons and kept thinking my bed would shoot me back up against the wall. It was actually quite comfortable.From a location point of view it was great - we flew in to Gatwick and a train brought us straight to St Pancras right across the road. The next day we got a Eurostar from St Pancras, so there was no long walk around London trying to find the hotel.The front door of the hotel is right beside an entrance to Kings Cross/St Pancras tube station so you could almost get to the hotel from the train without getting wet.As mentioned elsewhere the showers are very good - big heads and a good flow of hot water. One little problem was that in the absence of any sort of barrier the water from the shower had a habit of flooding the bathroom floor.Breakfast was included in our room rate - but note it is only the continental breakfast. We went for parts of the full breakfast. Food was very good and relatively good value. I would go for the full breakfast again. It was served in the main restaurant downstairs which is open to the public in the evening.Check-in and check-out were smooth and there were no problems there. The hotel bar is open 24 hours I think. It's a nice comfortable place to while away some time while waiting for others to get ready.The area around has plenty of old-school hotels but I would definitely return here. I tried to book direct with the hotel but they quoted the full rate. When I checked the rate on some of the online engines I got a much better rate."
13,963,"Oct 1 2009 	Very impressed with room less so with staff	My room at the Megaro was supremely clean, comfortable and spacious, with many useful amenities such as flat-screen TV (with lots of channels and free Internet access), mini-fridge (with free water and milk), and espresso machine. Dcor was modern and streamlined, closet and drawer space were ample, and the bed was supremely comfortable. The bathroom, which was spacious and extremely clean, had one of the best showers Ive ever used, as well as an inviting full-sized bathtub. If I were rating the Megaro on the quality of the room alone, Id give it 5 stars. One security feature I really appreciated was that access to the lift and stairs required use of a room key, so random people couldnt just walk in off the street and roam through the hotel. Except for the excellent housekeeping staff, service at the Megaro doesnt measure up to the same stellar standard as the accommodation. The young man who checked me in was curt and uncommunicative almost to the point of rudeness. No greeting, no volunteering of any information. When asked a direct question, hed answer it grudgingly, as briefly as possible. Fortunately, not all the staff was as sullen as this unpromising specimen; during my four-day stay, some of the young women who worked at the front desk showed that they knew how to smile and say hello to guests who passed through the lobby. Unfortunately, my check-out experience wasnt all that much more positive than my check-in. All four staff members at the desk, including the manager, were embroiled in some kind of discussion with the small group of travelers ahead of me in line, about the room rate that the group had booked. Three of the four staff members werent doing anything productivejust standing there looking perplexed. Finally, after several minutes, one of them realized that a queue was forming, and mercifully broke away to attend to other guests. She took a bafflingly long time processing my check-out, even though there was no ambiguity about my room rate, no problem with my credit card, and no accumulation of incidental expenses. Its a good thing I wasnt in a hurry. On customer service, Id have to give the Megaro 2.5, or at most 3, stars. This was not a staff Id want to depend on if I really needed help with anything important.Still, despite the shortcomings in service, Id readily stay at the Megaro again, provided I could get a similar discounted rate. Besides the great room, I really enjoyed the central locationso close to Eurostar, and convenient for getting to Islington, the City and the East End as well as all the attractions in the West End."
14,963,"Sep 28 2009 	excellent hotel in london	every thing is fantastic except breakfast, good location, value."
15,963,"Sep 24 2009 	Great location for St Pancras	Very nice hotel. Our room was very large and clean with a great shower! It is close to Euston Station and you couldn't get closer to St Pancras Station - It is opposite the main entrance!The staff were very friendly and helpful, looking on the internet to find the location of a pub we wanted to go to.We didn't have breakfast, as had an early train to catch, so can't review that.It was great valve for money as we booked it late and got a good deal.Overall very happy."
16,963,Sep 21 2009 	Excellent hotel	Hotel is located directly across the road from St. Pancras station. I arrived early but the staff were very helpful and stored my luggage until later in the day. The room provided was very good - a reasonable size for London and excellent in-room facilities including an expresso machine. Room was also very clean and very quiet..Would use this hotel again.
17,963,"Sep 18 2009 	Great location great hotel have booked again!	We couldn't believe how close this hotel was to the station. We arrived at 9.45 - check in wasnt til 2.00 but we left our bags in secure room, and when we checked out the next day we were able to leave our bags there again until our train at 3.pm, which I thought was brilliant. The hotel itself was very clean, the room was spotless and the bed very comfortable. I liked the fact we had an iron, ironing board and espresso machine in the room. There was abit of noise from street noise, but it was quite nice to hear the chaos outside and know that we were all cosy in our lovely room! We got home and booked the hotel again for around Christmas time - I would definately recommend it as a central place to stay when visiting London."
18,963,"Sep 2 2009	Fantastic place and location	This hotel is definitely a gem just across from King's Cross. I asked for a room with easy access as my mother moves around in a wheelchair and we were given an incredible room with facilities designed for such cases and at an incredible price. The room was equipped with a coffee maker, 32&quot; LCD TV, a comfortable sofa and with a spacious bathroom. The staff were incredibly helpful. The hotel even managed to squeeze in a lift which is really helpful for people with mobility or luggage problems. That is definitely something one rarely sees in hotels around King's Cross or St Pancras, at least if they are 3 stars and below."
19,963,"Sep 1 2009 	very good	Good location, near tube, Kings Cross/St Pancreas.Small reception area but had a drink at night in small bar, quiet but pleasant.Family room was excellent. Two doubles, two flat screen televisions etc.Great continental breakfast. Very helpful staff.Booked with airmiles."
20,963,"Aug 30 2009 	perfect for location to eurostar	For a hotel right next to Kings Cross / St Pancras you would think it would be more noisy but this was well sound proofed and really lovely. we got room only for about 80 quid and i don't think i would pay 240 which was the price listed at reception but the shower and bathroom were lovely and the room was clean and a good size. a nice touch was the access to loads of CD's via the TV system including a wide variety this made up for the limited digital signal on the telly. we were room only as had to hit the station at 8 am so can't comment on food but it all looked pretty good. for location to the eurostar it can't really be beaten - across the crossing outside the door and you are there!Felt quite posh, not too pricy and prefect spot for train."
21,963,"Aug 29 2009 	Great Hotel Friendly Staff Lovely rooms!	I stay at this hotel all the time and was kind of wondering if I should write a review just in case it gets too popular!I often have to travel on my own to London and Carol and the team make me feel incredibly welcome every time I come to town.Rooms are lovely and spacious, lovely bathrooms, chilled milk and water in the fridge as well as a coffee maker in your room and the beds are v comfy!Brilliant location for business travellers right next to the tube and Eurostar, and just a 4 minute walk from Euston for those travelling into town."
22,963,"Aug 24 2009 	Somewhere a little different from the norm	Stayed here overnight after a superb day on the Steam Dream's Cathedrals Express from Kings Cross. The hotel was booked thro Expedia and on arrival VAT was added to the quoted Expedia price. We found this unusual and it has never happened to us in any previous hotel bookings. Expedia's small print does say the hotel may or may not include tax in the total, I think the price should have clearly state &quot;+VAT&quot;. However, the hotel room was large, clean and modern - but quirky! Quite a few unusual features and I didn't understand why it was neccessary to have a drop down bed 600mm away from the window wall in such a large room. Generally a pleasant boutique style hotel which was conveniently placed for St.Pancras, Kings Cross and the British Library."
23,963,"Aug 24 2009 	Great Hotel	The hotel is just just across the road from Eurostar, which was great. The room we were given was huge, had a lovely bathroom and was spotless. The coffee machine was great, there were teabags too and complimentary water and fresh milk. The bed was huge and comfortable. The rates were good too as we booked in advance. We did not have time to sit down for breakfast but staff helped us by giving us some bread and crossiants to take with us. This is a gem of a hotel and I highly recommend it. There was some traffic noise, but you are in the centre of London and it was not bad."
24,963,"Aug 23 2009 	Really enjoyed my stay	I stayed here for three nights over a weekend in July and I really enjoyed my stay. There's an entrance for Kings Cross tube station basically right outside the door and Kings Cross is of course one of the bigger busier stations, so getting to the hotel from Heathrow was easy for a tired traveller. Reception staff were friendly and check in was quick. I had a room on the third floor around the side of the hotel, so it wasn't that noisy. My room was a standard room and was plenty big enough - double/queen bed, enough room for my case and my friend's smaller bag. The bathroom was nice - shower over bath, as mentioned the screen only covers half the bath so it can be a little wet after a shower. Shower was excellent though! The bathroom door was a normal wooden door - have seen some reviews saying some rooms have a frosted glass door. Some basic toiletries were provided. Internet is provided via an LCD tv on the wall which is free of charge and easy to use. My rate included breakfast in the restaurant downstairs which was pretty good - one hot meal, tea or coffee and anything from the buffet. Newspapers were provided each morning. Tried out the coffee machine just to make a cup of tea - coffee, teabags and milk provided. Small fridge to store your own drinks. Room had a good strong airconditioner too, and from memory you could open the windows slightly. Hotel has a small entrance and you need your room card to get through to the lift. There is only one and it's a little slow so take the stairs if you don't have any bags. I only stayed three nights but really enjoyed my stay, it was a nice start to my trip. I would recommend this to anyone looking for somewhere nice and central to stay in London - check their website for a special rate though."
25,963,"Aug 21 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	We stayed at the megaro hotel in Aug for a weekend break to visit friends. After searching for a hotel on this website we found this hotel. We called the hotel to see if they had any rooms available and how much they charge. We found they had a discount rate for Aug so opted to book the executive double room. We arrived at Euston station and found the hotel which was a five minute walk. On arrival at the hotel we checked in very quickly and headed for the room, when we entered we were suprised to see how large the room was ( we have stayed in higher priced hotels and they have been just a pokey room ). There was everything you need in the room a coffee machine extra milk, bottled water, iron and ironing board. There bathroom was really nice and had a decent large shower that a 6ft 5ins person could fit under. The my wife says that the best was the large comfy bed. The hotel is so close to everything the tube is right outside the hotel so you can get around london from there easly. The hotel staff are really friendly and allowed us to store our suitcase in the room for the whole day. I would really recommend this hotel and would stay there again"
26,963,"Aug 20 2009 	Absolutely loved this place!	Went away with a group of the girls for 3 nights in mid July and had to do a lot of research on London hotels as everyone had different budgets and different ideas as to what level of comfort they wanted. After a long search i found Megaro Hotel on trip advisor. Reviews and pictures looked great and after contacting the hotel for rates i was very happy to get a quote that fitted in with all of our budgets.We flew into Luton airport and got a shuttle bus straight to the train station and a train into st. pancreas station. We walked out of the station and were delighted to find out that the hotel was right across the road. Our rooms weren't ready as we arrived at around 10am but the helpful guy behind the front desk (don't know how to spell his name think it was Tahil or something like that sorry) put our luggage in the luggage room for us. Which left us free to explore London for the day with the kings cross tube station across the road. So handy!When we got to our rooms we fell in love. Lovely big double room with big bathroom, milk and bottled water provided in a mini fridge and also small safe and espresso machine. The air conditioning was brilliant as it was quite humid in london while we were there. Rooms were very clean too.There was a lovely night receptionist on named Suresh who served us drinks in the residents bar on the one night we decided to have a few drinks when we arrived back to the hotel.All in all we were so happy to find this hotel and will definitely be staying here again the next time i'm in London!"
27,963,"Aug 18 2009 	Terrific location and comfy room	Can't beat the location - literally steps away from Kings Cross subway. Easy access to 3 subway lines, Eurostar (to Paris) and trains to other parts of UK. Room is spacious with nice shower."
28,963,"Aug 16 2009 	Great value location!	For the money, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in London. The icing on the cake was the location - steps away from very central tube station, we had great access to all London has to offer, and felt safe coming &amp; going at all hours. The St. Pancras / King's Cross station across the street was ideal in that many different tube lines intersect there, and there was an underground path to steps coming up right outside the Megaro. Staff was very helpful and accommodating - stored our luggage securely and free of charge for the full day while we were out sightseeing and enjoying London until our train left that evening.Only downsides to the hotel were (1) the shower wasn't fully enclosed, nor was there a &quot;lip&quot; to the shower floor, meaning that there was often a mess of water after all 3 girls had washed up and (2) there is a bit of street noise audible -- not an issue for me, but a light sleeper might have a problem."
29,963,"Aug 13 2009 	Brilliant stay  both location and staff perfect	This is a good hotel both for business and leisure travels. Close to tube and trains , helpful staff and nice , quite spacious rooms. Recommended!"
30,963,"Aug 5 2009 	Excellent location and helpful staff	I was upgraded on arrival to a spacious room with a double bed and double sofa bed, it had flat screen TVs in each bedroom area and workstation, and a spacious bathroom with shower / loo/ basin. Everything was new and spotless. The style is budget boutique, and it is a budget hotel so don't expect Egyptian linen and Molton Brown handwash, but everything is nicely turned out and kept in good order. Breakfast wasn't included and was 7.50 for a continental choice or about 13.50 for that plus hot breakfast. Not clear on the room menu but priced in the restaurant itself were individual hot items to buy.The location is superb, directly on the Euston Road exit to Kings Cross, so getting to and from the hotel by bus, train and tube is easy, including after a late night out. They also have a free luggage room to use once you've checked out before you leave London.Paying less than half the rack rate for a room via hotel booking sites, I would certainly stay here again."
31,963,"Aug 4 2009 	Great clean convenient hotel.	Booked a family room, beds were one double and two full size singles ( good job as our kids are 5ft 8 and 6ft 2 ). Lovely clean room with ample space and nice bathroom. Milk supplied daily and extra coffee for the coffee machine was provided free of charge, bowl of fruit provided on first day and newspaper free of charge on both days. Staff very efficient, friendly and quick. Room ready for us when we arrived at 11am on the first day which was very welcome! Kept our many bags for us on our last day as we didn't leave until the evening. Can't fault the service! Didn't try the breakfast and room alittle noisy at night, although we expected this with the hotel having such a central location."
32,963,"Jul 26 2009 	Good but not anything special	After staying at this hotel for 1 night I left with very mixed feelings. Check-in took forever even though there were 4 members of staff there and only one other customer checking in at the same time as me. Nothing was very clear as to what they wanted from me and communication was poor to say the least. Again I don't know what it is with London hotels but they dont seem very good at directing you to your room, yet alone the lift! I asked and they would only go as far as telling me where the lift was, poor if you ask me. The room itself was lovely and big, which is what I wanted as I chose an executive room. The bed was very comfy and the wooden floors were lovely. Again as others have said the glass door for the bathroom could cause a few issues for some people. The addition of free internet access was a bonus and it worked very well and quickly. As I was on the top floor there was still some noise but I could imagine it could be quite a big problem on lower levels as there is not single glazing. Also the blinds are not that effective in blocking out all of the light so those who like dark rooms may wish to look elsewhere. The breakfast in the morning was very good, although again reception were less than forthcoming with directions to their own dining space?!? The one waitress was brilliant although the service was slow as she literally was doing everything, again very poor for a hotel of this supposed standard. Average breakfast, but some nice fresh croissants though! Check out was fairly quick although the staff again made no real effort. Overall I felt a bit let down by the hotel only on the customer service front, it was poor to say the least. But if you can overlook this then its a good hotel with nice rooms that a clean, spacious and nicely decorated. I would however say that you can do a lot better for your money, such as the K+K George in Earls Court, same (if not cheaper) price but a much better hotel overall!"
33,963,"Jul 25 2009 	excellent except the elevator	Just cross Euston road when you get out of St Pancras train station and there you are. The lobby is discreet but the room we got was great, nice bathroom, nice furnitures and nice paintings. Internet through TV is free of charge. The only issue was the elevator 'out of service'. Our room was on the 5th floor! A friend has been there one month later and was still not working..."
34,963,"Jul 23 2009 	Pity For The Breakfast...	We spent a week end break at the Megaro Hotel, coming from Paris.As many other travellers pointed out, the hotel is very convenient if you travel with Eurostar because its literally opposite Saint Pancras train station.We asked for interconnecting rooms but the hotel said tehy could only give us adjacent rooms which we accepted.Only, when we arrived the rooms were not adjacent at all although in the same corridor.We decided not to complain : as we have a toddler of 2 we asked for quiet rooms which we got and they were indeed very calm.The rooms are decorated with taste and everything is brand new. The nice detail is the espresso machine with complimentary water and milk in the fridge. Being Italian I particularly appreciated that because it changes from the Nescaf and the kettleWe were helped with tube and buses by receptionists so there is absolutely nothing to complain.What we did not appreciate was the continental breakfast included in our plan : the advertising in the lift mentioned a selection but the staff said that if we wanted certain things it would be extra.We made clear that we had no intention to pay an extra for an oat porridge and in the end we could have it included in the plan.Overall the buffet is pretty mediocre and could really improve."
35,963,"Jul 15 2009 	Great addition to hotels near St Pancras	The hotel entrance is very discreet (it's next door to Barclays, directly across from Pancras Road). The lobby is tiny, but there is a nice bar at the back. Check-in wasn't particularly slick, but well-meaning. Accessing the lift to the rooms requires a room key (reassuring, Kings Cross is improving as an area, but lone women should still be cautious late at nght).The room itself was excellent: very large by London standards, and a particularly comfortable bed. The bathroom had a glass door which was only partially opaque: the WC is not visible, but potentially a bather would be visible by his/her travelling companion.....! There is free wifi, complimentary mineral water and a decent tv. The fridge is great, but as a tea drinker, I would have preferred a proper kettle as well as the espresso machine.London had been unusually hot that week, and the air conditioning was essential: it did take a while to get going, but was very effective eventually. We got a really good deal via Laterooms for a Friday night: will definitely stay here again."
36,963,"Jul 6 2009 	the cleanest hotel ever wonderful place to stay	I stayed one night friday 3rd July, our room was one of the best I have ever stayed in worldwide and I worked in 5 star hotels for 15 years ! it was spotless , very big and with a great bathroom. The hotel manager, a lady was very helpful and very professional. A rare thing now days. The hotel was very good value and I would recommend this hotel fully."
37,963,"Jul 5 2009 	Roomy modern hotel	We spent three nights here in late June and would recommend the Megaro to any London visitors. We arrived early from Paris (on the Eurostar ) so we could not check in immediately. The staff stored our luggage and we were able to use the lobby restrooms to change and wash up. The front desk staff all were helpful and attentive so no complaints there. Our reservation was made directly through the hotel website and was fair (109/night) but did not include breakfast, which is available in the hotel restaurant. However, we found a small bakery nearby, Patisserie Deux Amis on Judd St (5 minute walk, left on Euston, left on Judd) which had wonderful breads, pastries and coffee for a morning start. We also ate dinner locally at the Camino (spanish food) restaurant and it was delicious.We had two executive double rooms (one for us, one for teenagers) and each was spacious (as big as what we are accustomed to in the US), clean, well furnished and equipped with a large LCD TV, which doubled as a computer monitor. The built in Internet was handy, when it worked; the kids room remote keyboard did not work (they had a laptop so no bother) and our internet froze on the final day. There is also no printer so printing boarding passes has to be accomplished elsewhere.The beds were very comfy and while the bathrooms were good sized there were two quirks. First, there was a bit of a problem with getting cold water. After the first day, the cold water tap produced warm water only and we were told that a plumber was working on the entire system to correct. Better to have hot water and no cold, than vice versa, but it was a little annoying. Second, the bathroom in the kids room was fully glass enclosed with frosted glass from about two feet off the floor to five feet high. Just a little strange. None of this would stop us from staying here again.The metro is literally steps from the front door and St. Pancras (Eurostar station) was just across the street. Regarding the front door - it is easy to miss as the hotel &quot;footprint&quot; is very small. There is a currency conversion shop next door and its rates are very good, especially compared to the train station. Kings Cross is a major station so access to everywhere is pretty easy from this location. There is a 9 3/4 gate for Harry Potter fans in the Kings Cross station near platform 8 for the suburban trains - just ask the station staff and they will direct you to it. The British Library is just down Euston Rd a bit and has the Magna Carta and other interesting collections. Otherwise this is a hotel in a train station neighborhood which is trying to clean up and has mostly, but not totally succeeded in doing so.The rooms all had air conditioning, a safe, espresso machine, milk and a small fridge with milk. The beds were big and comfy, really comfy. The room key also is used as a master electric control for the room (which we have seen in some other European hotels). Place it in a slot by the door and only then do you have lights and a/c, etc. There was one fairly small elevator which worked, although there was a wait at times because housekeeping also used the hotel to move the days dirty linens and towels in huge bags.You can book this hotel with confidence and enjoy a big comfortable room at a good price. The staff will help you upon request and the whole of London awaits you through the Underground."
38,963,"Jun 23 2009 	Very convenient spotlessly clean and good value	We usually opt for the Novotel St Pancras for nearness to Kings Cross station for convenience but it had no availability for one night on our way back from a week's holiday in New York. We discovered the Megaro and booked via the internet. I was a bit dubious as we have experienced some poor hotels in the Kings Cross area in the past. The entrance was small and unassuming and at first we thought it was solely the restaurant entrance. We arrived at 1145 am, jetlagged after a long flight and then an hour on the tube from Heathrow so were disappointed that we couldn't check in until 2pm. They did let us leave our heavy cases though and we killed time, returning2 hours later. I liked the fact that you could not access the stairs and lift to the bedroom without using a room card. The room itself was 'superior' (I don't know how this differs from 'standard?') and although it's not huge it's minimalistic and very contemporary with everything provided that you need. Well thought out, with fabulous coffee maker, a fridge complete with a small bottle of milk, an electronic safe and very easy-to-use thermostat controls. Everything was spotlessly clean, the bathrom was lovely (and I'm fussy!) and the shower was brilliant. We were a bit concerned about traffic noise but didn't hear anything once we got into the very comfy bed and slept like logs! A free daily newspaper was outside our room (and all rooms) in the morning. The staff, who were Italian, were helpful and couldn't do enough. The continental breakfast which was included in our one night stay of 106 was perfectly sufficient, very nice and consisted of cereals, juice, croissants, rolls, cheese and ham. The only niggle in the breakfast room (downstairs restaurant) is that it was extremely cold, but I suppose that's a minor thing. This hotel was everything and more that we hoped for and we would definitely use it again and have no hesitation in recommending it."
39,963,"Jun 20 2009 	Excellent location very comfortable friendly safe for a family with 2 kids	We were a family with 2 daughters - 10 and 16. Spent 2 nights-1-2 Jun 09. Excellent and safe location in central London. Across the road from King's Cross tube station and St Pancras Int'l stn for Eurostar which we took for Paris. Sumptuous breakfast. Hot milk given on request. Cloak room near reception for keeping the bags. Staff not too conversant with English(seemed Italian or Spanish) though very helpful and one can manage even with this little handicap. We had a Quad room which was very spacious and also economical vis-a-vis 2 double occupancy rooms(Room#202). Good view of the road outside and King's Cross tube stn esp at night. Had done booking thru local Delhi-based agent who used Gullivers Travel Agents(GTA) software. No difficulties at all at check-in or chk-out. Room and bathroom adequately provided/stocked with amenities. Had an digital safe, electric kettle, iron, hair-drier, wi-fi connectivity (tv+remote used for surfing), LCD tv, fridge etc. Clean room and bed linen. Overall very comfortable stay and we would love to come back to this hotel."
40,963,"Jun 5 2009 	Never stayed in a better London hotel!	Location beside st. Pancreas station was great - comfort and space in bedroom fantistic, there was water and an espresso machine with fresh milk in fridge - absolutely everything you could need. Staff were absolutely great and nothing too much trouble from more coffee pods for the room to taxis and directions, the service was second to none and always with smile and humour!The street presence is quite small and easily missed if you don't know where to look and taxis often had'nt heard of it - but once found is a little gem of only about 50 rooms with all the charm, comfort and service of the large luxury hotels but with much more heart!"
41,963,"Jun 3 2009 	Lovely room and excellent location	We stayed in this hotel over a weekend and cannot fault it as a base in London. We travelled via St Pancras, so the location is perfect for dropping off bags and travelling onwards by tube. The reception staff were very helpful, the lift worked (see previous reviews...) and we were very pleased with the room we had. It overlooked the back of the hotel and there were no traffic noise problems. Very comfortable bed, a decent bathroom and we appreciated the internet connection so we could check train departure times etc. On this visit we didn't use the bar or restaurant so can't comment on these facilities, however, we intend to use the hotel again on future visits to London"
42,963,"Jun 1 2009 	Great Location and room	We stayed in this hotel for only 1 night on European vacation. It was directly across the street from Kings Cross St. Pancras Rail/Tube station which was absolutely IDEAL. 5 min on the tube to go to Trafalgar Square (Tourist central) .Great value (approx 60 GBP) for a great room which was newly renovated. The shower was absolutely amazing...just like a spa. The room was quite small and there wasn't a lot of room for 2 suitcases but that's about the only complaint I have. Did not order room service or stay for breakfast because it was quite expensive in the restaurant but we went to a local bakery on our way out.For dinner there are great pubs and restaurants all along the street.Overall, excellent room for a great value if you are staying short term."
43,963,"May 29 2009 	Great value in London for a nice and clean hotel	We stayed 2 nights with a family of 6 (4 chidren aged 3 to 13). Overall excellent experience with a good value for London. We had a family room at 120 and a regular room at 90. Megaro is located on Euston street, right across King's Cross and St Pancras. Extremely convenient if you come through these stations since you literally cross the street, can drop your luggage and start the day! The flip side is the noise coming from Euston Road, which is a major axis and is very busy if not traffic jammed. Reception is not particularly friendly, but gets the job done. We had room in the front, and even with triple windows, you still hear the rumble (and actually can sometimes feel it!). A good pair of hear plug solved that problem for me, and the kids walked so much during the day that they went to sleep without even a little fight...Room are surprisingly large for a city hotel. The family room has a double bed, plus 2 single beds that are stored in cupboards. The single beds can accomodate adults. This hotel has been seriously renovated recently (I would say less than 5 years), and is maintained very clean. The bathroom have full polished glass panelling, and are not miles away from what you can find at the Metropolitan on Hyde Park for example. I would characterize the decor as trendy modern. TV with free internet is a plus, not very fast tough.Breakfast is served in the restaurant located in the basement. 7.5 buffet breakfast is good, and includes porridge, cereals, pastries, yougurt, ham and cheese, and freshly squeezed fruit juice. Eggs and other more elaborate dishes are extra. Service is nice, and prepared a botte for our 3 year old with a smile.There is really not much to be seen within walking distance of the hotel, but there is a tube station right in front of it. We had a bit of a hard time to find a place to eat diner for 6 after 7pm. Pizza express about 200m from the hotel is a good family choice, but long queue after 7pm. The first night we ended up eating at the &quot;bar&quot; which serves soups, salads and main dishes. Very glad it was there, but portions are not huge. There is a Burger King next door for truly desperate situations.Overall, an excellent base for exploration in London. Plenty of buses can bring you back to the hotel in the evening, and it is so much more fun with the kids than riding the tube in the morning..."
44,963,"May 27 2009 	Great location - Excellent Value	We arrived at this hotel early in the morning from Australia and as it was fully booked the previous night the room was not available until at least 1.00pm. The reception staff were very friendly and offered us an area at the end of the bar to open our luggage and to change our clothes in the ground floor bathrooms before storing our luggage. We were also offerd coffee by the recption staff. The rooms at this hotel are very modern, the bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was great and the room was air conditioned and fitted with a safe. All this at a very reasonable tariff.We left early so did not sample the breakfast but there is a wide range of good eateries opposite in St Pancras stationWe would definitely return to this hotel."
45,963,"May 22 2009 	Unwelcoming	Very unfriendly reception, unhelpful, disinterested receptionist was too busy chatting to a friend to serve us!The restaurant was being cleaned when we turned up for dinner we were offered a table in an empty room that turned out to be the worlds most uninteresting bar there were no other customers.The windows would not open they were locked shut. The air conditioning would not work and when we complained we were told it was sunday and no-one could fix it it until Monday if we were lucky.This was a very expensive awful experience I would not recommend this hotel if it was the last one in London it claims to be 4 star that is a joke and a sick one at that."
46,963,"May 17 2009 	Upgrade! Woohoo! Great location for Eurostar!	We arrived and were upgraded to the deluxe room as we are honeymooning. The deluxe room was huge, really massive for London! The coffee machine was great, great view of Kings Cross station and so convenient for our travels to France on the Eurostar and no train noise whatsoever. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean, nice and modern. Staff were very helpful - they printed out tickets for us. Would recommend this hotel, especially for those using the Eurostar. Had a great stay and the staff were lovely!"
47,963,"Apr 30 2009 	LOVE this hotel!	We stayed at the Megaro on our last night. Wish we would have found it earlier! The room was large, very modern, and the bath was great! The bed and pliiows were the most comfortable we stayed in! The hotel was quiet as well-good when you've been gone from home for 10 days! The train station is right across the street, which makes travel easy! My only complaint was that the &quot;bartender&quot; did not what he was doing. He told us he had never even drank a beer and did not have any recommendations-OK. It would be nice if they had someone a little more experienced in that area.Otherwise, great stay. I will visit this hotel again!"
48,963,"Apr 28 2009 	Excellent hotel. Shame about rude staff!	The hotel is in an excellent location, and if you pre-book is not a bad price. The rooms were exceptionally clean and very large.One big problem is the bath tub. The side of it to climb out of was stupidly high, and for anyone shorter than about 5ft 9 would likely cause real problems with wet feet.We had a great time until we 'overstayed' our welcome. On the day we were checking out we used the lastminute.com booking slip as our reference, which stated 12 midday as checkout time. At about 11 we got a reasonably rude call to the room telling us we has overstayed and should immediately check-out as checkout was earlier. When we got to the reception desk we queried the booking form with them, and a lady that had previously had nothing to do with us (and was sat in the office on her hotmail) came out and very rudely told us that we were wrong and lastminute had made a mistake - she made it feel like WE should be in charge of telling their booking agent, and that it was nothing to do with them!Other than that, very good."
49,963,"Apr 26 2009 	Just right to make you feel comfortable!	Excellent hotel, fantastic location, friendly stuff, very cosy spacious room, contemporary design with an appreciation for details, but without overdoing it. Just right to make you feel comfortable! I also appreciate the wooden floors and white linen, free in-room internet, deluxe coffee-machine and the daily refill of still and sparkling water. The beds are huge, but the mattress was for my standards a little too soft. However, without any doubts my favourite hotel choice in London."
50,963,"Apr 24 2009 	Ideal location for an early start on the Eurostar	Great hotel with really helpful staff and spotless rooms. The only issue was problems with the thermostat in the morning - the water was too hot to shower and no cold water to clean teeth! However, well worth staying here if you're off early on the Eurostar - just across the road."
51,963,"Apr 23 2009 	A WONDERFUL SURPRISE	We stayed here for 2 days in April and picked it primarily for the location because we were headed to Paris via Eurostar. TIP: We got a great rate including full breakfast right on their website that beat all other sites prices. I arrived a bit nervous because 2 days before the trip they emailed me to confirm my reservation was for a single (which it was not) and that there were only rooms with double beds available. I wrote back to say a double bed was really not acceptible since I had a reservation stating I booked a room with twin beds and listed the number of guests. I was travelling with a teenage daughter who tosses a lot and I am a light sleeper. They said would get me an extra bed and I assumed it would a be a roll away cot. I appreciated them doing their best to fix a terrible mix up but the idea of putting a roll away into what I imagined would be small city hotel room was a bit nerve wracking. Well I was SO WRONG they instead upgraded us to room with a separate seating area that had a double pull out couch (Which a very thick and nice mattress not one of those ones where you feel the springs through). In general the room was a great size, larger than we expected (even minus the 'sitting area' ). The upgrade made our day but without that I still have to say the beds were VERY comfortable, everything was in beautiful new condition, I loved the Expresso machine , the bathroom was huge (not sure if that was just in the upgraded room or not) and the staff was very helpful. We were worried about Kings Cross being a bit out of the center of things but is was so easy to get around. We'll definitely chose it again if we make it back to London."
52,963,"Apr 22 2009 	Excellent hotel	Excellent hotel for a leisure weekend in London. The underground is just in front of the main door, and St. Pancras station is at 5 minutes from the center. Huge rooms with ultra modern design and high quality materials (have the most confortable bed I've ever seen). Highly recommended !!!"
53,963,"Apr 21 2009 	Pricey but worth it	A bir pricey at 120 per night but if you want to avoid a dodgy place and make sure you stay somewhere convenient, clean and close to the train station then Megaro is the best :)"
54,963,"Apr 19 2009 	Great location for Eurostar station	We stayed here on 9 April for one night before travelling on the early Eurostar to Paris. It is literally across the road from St Pancras Station, so incredibly convenient. Food in the restaurant is excellent but unfortunately did not open until 7 am for breakfast, which was too late for us. The rooms are comfortable but quite small, however we were staying overnight only so it was not a problem. The only real criticism; the shower screen is not wide enough and the bathroom floor tends to get very wet! If you are staying for longer it might be worth paying more for the better rooms because we did suffer slightly from street noise, not enough to keep us awake all night, but enough to be disturbed."
55,963,"Apr 19 2009 	Almost perfect	Stayed at the Megaro this weekend with my boyfriend for one night. The location was fantastic. Right next to the tube station so within seconds of leaving the hotel you could be on the tube to anywhere in London. Also just down the road from St Pancras so really useful for getting the train back home. We were able to leave our luggage with the hotel after checking out so didn't have to lug it around the city all day. The hotel was almost perfect. Really comfy bed, free tv and internet and a really cool jukebox kind of thing on the tv! Room was very minimalist and the wall to the bathroom is glass and completely see through! Not a prob for me and my boyfriend but might be a bit awkward if with family! Was very clean which is always a big thing for me. The only little niggles I had were we didn't have any milk in the fridge so we had to ask a maid for some before we could have a cup of tea, and we were only given one bottle of water. Could have done with more (especially with a hangover!) although seeing as it was complimentary suppose I can't really complain. To sum up great location, reasonably priced, plenty of complimentary things and really lovely hotel. Would def stay again."
56,963,"Apr 16 2009 	Almost perfect - big room clean good service	I was there earlier April, it's close to train/bus station, very convenience, service is super good and the staffs are helpful~~ The room is very big and clean and the bed is confortable, also, I enjoy the free wifi and little thing is that a bit noise, but it's ok."
57,963,"Apr 15 2009 	A Perfect Last Day in London	Excellent location - right next to St. Pancras/ King's Cross station. The staff are all very friendly and helpful - they even gave me a message my friend left for me the night before before i checked in; on another occasion, i couldn't find the phone (because it looks really modern and is only this small, minimalist, rectangular thing at the corner of the wall) and decided to go down to the reception to ask about it, but as i was waiting for the elevator a staff member casually asked if i was happy about the room and i told him about the missing phone. He immediately went to my room to show me where it was even though he seemed to be in a hurry to some duty.ABSOLUTELY loved the free internet access inside my own room. The shower was great too. I checked the floor plan and it seemed that i had the smallest room on the whole floor but it already felt spacious enough. And there's an expresso machine inside the room too.The entrance of the hotel is quite small so some might miss it by mistake."
58,963,"Mar 29 2009 	Loved it!	I booked Eurostar for a day trip but to get the 59 deal it meant having to stay in London the night before so that we could check in at 5.45 am. I can't actually remember how I came across this hotel but so glad I did. The hotel itself is just across the road from Kings Cross and St Pancras and probably the most attractive business in sight. Location wise you really couldnt find anything closer.I booked directly on the hotel's website as this seemed to be the cheapest at 79 including VAT. When booking I asked if we could have a quiet room which is probably a bit optimistic in Kings Cross area but they accomodated my request and placed us in a bedroom on the 6th floor which was not directly overlooking the Euston Road. The room was HUGE. There was a separate lounge area with a big sofa, flat screen TV and wardrobe which had in it mini bar with two bottles of water and fresh milk, an espresso machine, iron and ironing board. In the bedroom area again there was another LG flat screen TV and then there was a huge bathroom which was beautifully decorated. I had booked a table for dinner but we decided to go to the bar for a quick drink first, The bar is cosy and seems to get a few regulars who are commuting back home from London. The barman was very friendly and service was great,We went downstairs to the restaurant where I have to say I probably had the nicest dinner I have ever experienced out of all my years of dining in London. The menu itself was a great menu with varied choice and reasonable prices. I chose the halibut and my boyfriend the lamb. Both were exquisite. We both then chose chocolate fondant dessert for dessert. The atmosphere was very buzzy with hotel guests and people who were not staying there dining there. I would go there again in a heartbeat.I would certainly stay at Megaro again. Value wise it was amazing."
59,963,"Mar 23 2009 	Disapointed	I booked this hotel through expedia and expected the price online to be the total. However, the hotel added Tax - VAT? so it was an extra 10, breakfast was not included. They left a paper outside the room door, which was good, then charged us for it! The lift was not working and 4 flights of stairs were hard to negotiate with luggage.The shower had loads of jets which was nice but no shower door so flooded the bathroom!I am cross as I left a radio behind and this has not been handed in.The good things were the bed was really comfy and large, we overlooked the main road but the room was really quiet, the temperature was just right. Nice TV and wireless internet for free."
60,963,"Mar 11 2009 	absolutely OK!	hotel is absolutely ok.very good location, easy to access from heathrowrooms are small but have avery cool shower and everything else you need for a 8-hour sleep,even free internet via TV and tea and coffee!i will stay there again for sure... just try to get a room on the lower floors since that lift never seems to work."
61,963,Mar 3 2009 	Most Comfortable Bed - Ever!	I have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Megaro hotel and I would highly recommend this hotel. The hotel is situated directly across the road from the entrance to the King's cross station - it is easily accessable from an underground tunnel that will bring you to the door of the hotel! True the King's cross area is not the most picturesque area of London by a long shot but it is a good location for sightseeing in London. We went there for an Arsenal game - the Emirates stadium is only 3 stops away. Anyway back to the hotel - from the outside it is nothing much - tucked away between Burger king and a bureau de change. The reception area is quite small with a bar/dining area next to it. We stayed in room 402 on the 4th floor - the room itself was huge - a large double bed and also the capacity to fit 2 more people with 2 pull out beds hidden in 2 wardrobes - there would be plenty of room for 4 to share this room. The bathroom had a bath and shower and interestingly the sound from the television also was piped through to the bathroom from the large flat screen TV in the bedroom. Also in the bathroom they provide fluffy bathsheets rather than the miserable little affairs that some hotels think pass for a towel! The decor of the bedroom and the hotel in general is very understated with a lot of use of pale wood and frosted glass - very minimalist in design and very easy to keep clean. The bed itself was one of the most comfortable beds (besides my own!) that I have ever slept in with lovely crisp white sheets - they use down filled pillows and quilts so bear that in mind if you have allergies. The windows were quite well insulated against the noise of Euston road- you will hear some noise during the night but it is quite muffled and I don't think that it is at a level that would prevent anyone from sleeping.Continental breakfast was ample with a good enough choice served in their basement restaurant - very good quality fruit juice and raspberry jam! Dinner is also available in the restaurant.Our room was also equipped with an espresso machine and fridge.The only downside to this hotel was the fact that the lift was not working during our stay which meant we had to climb 4 flights of stairs after a day spend walking around London not the best way to end the day! The hotel staff made it sound as though it was a recent problem but I only just discovered from reading other reviews just now that it appears as though the lift has been out of order since at least the start of February which isn't really acceptable for a 4 star hotel.All in all - I would recommend this hotel for a short break in London.
62,963,"Feb 19 2009 	Incredible rooms clean centrally located nice price	This was a very pleasant find! Thanks to the reviewers in TripAdvisor that included pictures and their experiences, we found a gem in London.The rooms really do look like in the pics. It is clean and centrally located. It cost less than our B&amp;B in York and I will go back again. It is trendy, the rooms are quite large, modern, free espresso, plasma TVs with internet. Loved it!The check-in was incredibly fast but the woman was not very friendly (shame). The rest of the staff was accomodating and cordial."
63,963,"Feb 17 2009 	Great location; bathroom needs work	The Megaro has a fantastic location, just over the road from St. Pancras and Kings Cross stations, though it is wedged somewhat unprepossessingly between a bureau de change and a Burger King. My room was very spacious, tastefully fitted out, with a comfortable bed and an espresso machine. Very good value at a low weekend rate. Some quibbles, though. The shower cubicle in the bathroom had a pebble-effect floor, which had been patched up several times with sealant; the rest of the bathroom was floored in laminate which had become warped and was lifting away from its base. The lift was also not working and wasn't repaired in the 24 hours I was there. The hotel had been open less than 12 months, according to the reception."
64,963,"Feb 3 2009 	Great room but some small improvements to make excellent	Found this hotel through Laterooms.com and got a bargain - absolutely fantastic value for money. The hotel was smart, clean, beautifuly decorated and the location was perfect! Literally 20 yards to Kings Cross underground and station, and right opposite St Pancras.When we first arrived we were booked in quickly and the staff were friendly and professional. We were given our room key and found out we were on the top (5th) floor, and then told that the lift was out of order! They did offer to carry our bags for us though. 10 flights of stairs later and we finally got to our room.... well worth every step! We had booked a standard but when we checkedo ut it turned out we had been upgraded to a deluxe room! Very nice, but there were a couple of small problems. When we first arrived, there was no heating in our room so it was really cold but after turning the thermostat on it quickly got warm - too warm! There was no plug for the bath but a quick phone call to reception soon sorted that out. It was a little noisy but not too bad - however if we had been lower down it may have been an issue.Would definately stay there again but only at a discounted rate. I wouldn't pay full rate for this hotel!"
65,963,Feb 1 2009 	Good location and friendly place	The hotel is very handy for kings cross (overnight business trip). The restaurant is reasonable in price and selection. The room was clean and comfortable although a little quirky with the phone located on the far side of the very large room. The room had two 32&quot; flat screen TVs. Freeview was available but no on demand services which were out of order. The slightly complicated coffee machine failed to work. Free wifi was available throughout. The staff were efficient and helpful. One major problem is there is only one lift and it was broken down so people on the 6th floor had quite a climb. On arrival on the floor there are no direction signs to the rooms so unless you know exactly where to go a little exploration is required. Otherwise its very pleasant and will if possible stay there again.
66,963,"Dec 13 2008 	Noise!!	This hotel is in an excellent location for St Pancras International and Kings Cross stations. The room was very spacious and modern and potentially good value. The modern ensuite had glass doors and some folks do like a bit of privacy when on the loo!! I also found the shower a little complicated to use and had some difficulty getting into the very high side of the bath to stand under the shower. However, all this was of little significance when we tried to get to sleep. We had a beautiful room at the front of the hotel but the window glazing leaves a lot to be desired. The noise from Euston Road is unbelievable. There was traffic noise, people shouting and continual sirens all night. Several times during the night I got up just to check a window had not been left open. At one point the sirens were so loud, I began to wonder if it was the hotel fire alarm. As a result we had very minimal sleep. The hotel could easily remedy the situation with a little double glazing. Anyone booking this hotel should insist on a rear room."
67,963,"Dec 5 2008 	convenient location and clean rooms but nothing special	I booked a room based on decent reviews here, and because we wanted to stay near King's Cross station for travel convenience. The price was right -- certainly reasonable for London. But the room was extremely small and we had trouble regulating the temperature. Despite turning down the thermostat, the room was terribly overheated, and we ended up having to leave the window open all night. We've stayed at a number of other London hotels, and perhaps we're spoiled, being accustomed to much more posh accommodations -- but I admit, you do have to pay quite a bit more for that poshness. So for the price, the Megaro is O.K. But I wouldn't give it high marks for anything but what it is: a handy stop for travelers who need access to the train system."
68,963,"Nov 30 2008 	Getting overpriced	I often have business in this part of London and decided to give this hotel a try as a new entrant to the market. Generally, I was quite impressed but the posted rates seem high for the location and market and the internet rate I got was higher than the tripadviser average. OK - but this is not a really special hotel. It is right across the street from St Pancras and Kings Cross. Despite the heavy traffic, the sound insulation is very good and I had an undisturbed night. The room was very spacious and modern in decor, although I would not be a fan of sharing it - the bathroom was in the contemporary style with a glass front that had a very narrow opaque band to preserve the privacy of one's personal activities. Good shower, but a high side to the bath so it wouldn't suit anyone with any degree of hip problem. The espresso machine was a nice idea but needed better instructions - I could only get a dribble of discoloured water out of it. Front desk were friendly and efficient. Didn't try the breakfast - there are nicer-looking places within St Pancras."
69,963,"Nov 27 2008 	Great for a Eurostar Stopover	This is a great hotel for anyone needing a stopover in london before using the eurostar like ourselves, i probably wouldn't recommend it as a leisure break stop hotel in london, simply as i feel it lacks any kind of personality or warmth. As other reviews say it is directly opposite kings cross (our room overlooked it) so is very convenient. check in was quick and easy, not overly fussy we were directed toward the lift that was it (we wernt told what floor are room was on or offered any help). Rooms were clean and tidy, very good tv with internet function (keyboard is very niggly). I can see the decor looking very tired and dated in a couple of years yet at the moment looks as new as it is. Workmanship is questionable such as the finishing touches look rushed and botched in places. We couldn't get any cold water in our bathroom both taps produced hot water which was a pain. however the price is very good for london and being that its so convenient to kings cross and st pancras you cant complain to much. I would stay here again if we need a stopover for the eurostar again."
70,963,"Nov 20 2008 	very solid find in Kings Cross	The Megaro is directly - and I mean directly - across from Kings Cross station, and thus hugely convenient both for that station and St Pancras next door (and for the British Library, my own destination). It is on Euston Road, which is noisy, busy, and filled with the &quot;youts&quot; of various nations - that said, two blocks to the south you are well into Bloomsbury, home of good pubs and restaurants and the British Museum. The hotel itself provides shelter from the Euston Road storm; desk staff were efficient and friendly. I didn't use the bar (24 hours, supposedly) or restaurant, but they looked fine. My room was off the front and quite quiet - good array of toys and conveniences (expresso machine, high pressure shower (pretty good for the UK!), flat screen TV, free wireless, fridge, safe) and certainly big enough to spread out a bit. All in all a good stay - while the neighborhood might be wearing for a long stay, for a night or two, or if you don't mind walking, this can be good value for money and a comfortable hideaway. And for an overnight to or from a Eurostar train, it would be hard to beat."
71,963,"Nov 7 2008 	Excellent stopover	This hotel is clean, modern and very comfortable. We stayed for one night before catching the Eurostar and I would highly recommend it. The location is ideal, literally across the road from St Pancras. The staff were extremely helpful and all spoke good English (a rarity in London hotels these days, from what I can gather!)As a family of 4 with two young children aged 5 and 3, we had booked a family room. The children slept on good quality beds that pulled down from the wall (already set up). There was still sufficient space in the room even with 2 single beds and a 5-ft main bed. The room also offered a flat screen TV, free internet access via a wireless keyboard, a pod-type coffee machine (didn't seem to be working properly as very slow), complimentary milk (for the coffees) and water. At check-in we were advised that everything in the room was free except chargeable movies - it was nice to have that certainty. The bathroom was also modern with a range of nice toiletries offered and the shower had good pressure. We didn't try out the restaurant at all.I would definitely stay here again if catching an early morning Eurostar out of St Pancras."
72,963,"Oct 27 2008 	What a pleasant surprise!	Spent a night there before catching an early train to France. The service was exceptional, rooms clean, spacious and new. Loved the bathrooms. It is an oasis in the middle of Kings Cross."
73,963,"Oct 22 2008 	Mega fab!	My family and I stayed one night here before heading to Disneyland Paris the following morning. The hotel was clean and comfortable. They provided a cot bed for my daughter and there were still room to move around! I especially liked the use of the free internet (with a wireless keyboard) and Wifi. The Tv on the wall was great too! Breakfast was including but it was a very basic contenential breakfast, cheese, bread and ham. Cooked breakfast was charged extra. St Pancreas station was very close by, we walked there with one large suitcase and a pushchair. All in all the stay was very good."
74,963,"Oct 16 2008 	Very good stay at Megaro	Slightly dubious that there might be a lot of noise at night when booking this hotel, but was reassured by reading other reviews. Having asked for a quiet room when booking (and got a great deal at 99 for one night double room), I was very well pleased with the hotel and facilities.A small problem with the TV was immediately fixed by the staff, and the room and bathroom was very clean and stylish. Loved the jukebox feature on the TV as well - a great range of music available to suit all tastes. Would definintely stay here again, and recommend to people wanting a convenient base from which to explore London."
75,963,"Sep 24 2008 	Lovely Hotel	This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. I chose it for its close proximity to St Pancras (we were supposed to be travelling on Eurostar the next day but it was closed due to the fire).The staff at the hotel rang while we were on the train to check we were still coming - apparently lots of people had cancelled due to the Eurostar problems.We were given a lovely room on the top floor with great bathroom, which made up for not going on Eurostar - we got a flight to Paris from Heathrow (expensive though and we weren't covered by our insurance).We hadn't had the breakfast on our last stay but decided to go for it this time - it was good with plenty of choice.The staff were really helpful and friendly, and we will definitely be back for another visit."
76,963,"Sep 22 2008 	Ideal for Eurostar travellers	Stayed one night at The Megaro before taking Eurostar to Paris, used some airmiles so there was no cost involved. Having seen some of the seedier type hotels in London, was pleasanly surprised, there was a good welcome from the staff. The room was large, and the bathroom really good, there was a great shower!..Breakfast was excellent, and the young lady serving was really happy and helpful.We were sorry we did not have dinner there the previous evening, as we had a somewhat mediocre meal at St Pancras station.It is ideally situated for Eurostar, just across the road, couldn't be easier."
77,963,Sep 18 2008 	Fanastic hotel!	We stayed in this hotel the night before we travelled on the Euro star.When we got there we were upgraded to a fab room with a view over king's cross.We paid a rate of 109 not ncluding breakfast.Three year old had her own bed and baby was in a travel cot.Room had coffee machine swing around chairs huge bathroom and big fluffy towels.Staff were very helpfull during our stay.Breakfast was expensive.
78,963,"Sep 15 2008 	Finally a nice affordable hotel in London	I just spent two nights at Megaro Hotel and was impressed. It was my first time in London with my daughter (17 months) so I was looking for somewhere nicer since we would be spending more time than usual in the room. Finding somewhere decent and affordable seemed like an impossible task at first but then I found a 120  per night deal on the hotel's website and decided to go for it. The hotel is modern and clean. Our room was on the top floor and for a standard room it was huge. It had a slightly separated closet area which we used as a baby room. They provided a cot and were very child friendly in general (which can't be said of every hotel...). They even brought us extra milk for the baby! The bathroom was amazing! Breakfast wasn't the cheapest but the waitress was adorable and they had a highchair for the baby. If you don't want to have breakfast there, there is a delicious French bakery on Judd street (I believe it's called &quot;Les deux amies&quot;). As far as the noise is concerned it is true: our room was right on Euston Road and it did get quite noisy, but it was manageable. No noise coming from the other rooms though, which would have annoyed me much more. The area isn't particularly nice or posh but I wouldn't decribe it as dodgy. I got home by myself with the baby around 9 pm on the second night and felt completely safe. Plus Russel Square and the British Museum are just a 20 minute walk away. Toward the end of Judd Street (perpendicular to Euston RD, a couple of 100 m from the hotel, about a 5 minute walk from the Megaro) there is a very nice open air shopping center with plenty of stores, restaurants and even a cinema. I don't exactly recall the name but it was something like &quot;Brunswick Center&quot;. We had lunch there on the first day and coffee in the sun on Sunday. Couldn't have asked for more. There are plenty of other restaurants and pubs in the British Museum area, an easy walk or a cheap taxi ride from the hotel. So all in all if somewhere vaguely affordable, nice and pretty central is what you're looking for, go for the Megaro!"
79,963,"Sep 9 2008 	Really good convenient hotel	I agree with all the positive reviews. I stayed here for 2 nights on business. I asked for and got a quiet room which was nice and large and light.Good things to note were the helpfulness of the staff, the free internet access and great quality food via room service.I booked this hotel because my usual choice (the Whitehall Hotel on Montague Street) was full, but this will be my first choice in future."
80,963,"Sep 5 2008 	Good quality	The Megaro is located opposite Kings Cross train station on Euston Road. Convenient for those travelling to/from London via this station. It's location however, means that if you have a front facing room then the busy traffic on Euston Road will likely disturb your sleep in the morning. The windows aren't double glazed so when the traffic noise starts up at about 7a, it sounds like you're right on the street.Other than that though the rooms are a reasonable size with new and modern decor.The staff are friendly and courteous. The rooms are also clean. So it ticks all the boxes for as far as stay was concerned.Breakfast wasn't cheap - 13 for a full cooked breakfast. The quality seemed ok. No issues there. The area around Kings Cross isn't the greatest though - a bit dodgy. It took us 10 minutes to find a restaurant (any restaurant) - an Italian place where the food tasted like i cooked it. Yes, it was that bad.Overall this hotel is worth staying at if you need to be in the area around Kings Cross. Otherwise though, I'd stay clear of the area altogether and stay somewhere else in London with more stuff going on and a bit safer."
81,963,"Sep 3 2008 	Superb hotel	This hotel was a complete and welcome surprise! We stayed with out two children (9 and 13) and had a GREAT time. The staff was very professional and helpful and they held our bags when we arrived at 7:45am, and we checked in later in the day. The room was very large with a superbly appointed bathroom. The bedding was exceptional, and changed regularly during our stay, as were the luxurious towels, which were provided for each person in the room. The air conditioning worked wonderfully, and the double pane window system made the traffic a distant mumble. The hotel was literally feet from the Underground station, and there were plenty of restaurants in the area. This was a remarkable find in London and we thought it was an exceptional value for the price. We felt perfectly safe there, and the free unlimited Internet access through the room's large flat panel TV was very helpful."
82,963,"Aug 26 2008 	Megaro Hotel Great Hotel near Kings Cross	We spent one night at the Megaro Hotel and it was a great hotel and we good a great rate (99 pounds for double). The room was larger than all the other London hotels we stayed in). The room was very modern with room for all our bags to be opened without putting them on the bed. They even had wash cloths!! The bed was very comfortable. The hotel is just across the street from both Kings Cross station (for train to Edinburgh) and St Pancaras (for EuroStar to Paris). They only issue we had was there was no sign out side of the hotel - they said it was on order. There is a sign for the Megaro Restaurant and Bar. So, I went in and found the hotel lobby to the left of the restaurant entrance. Breakfast is not included, if you want it, be prepared to spend $25. We skipped it and went down the street to McDonalds."
83,963,Aug 8 2008 	Perfect Stay	I seriously love this hotel! We booked last minute at the height of tourist season and were able to stay over a week in their double executive suite. We had a great view of the beautiful St. Pancras Station. A paper every morning and expresso machine in room...although ours was leaking due to a faulty o-ring. What can ya do about those things. Anything we needed we got straight away.Wi-fi is available in room and also access through the LG flat screen television. All and all this was a great stay and I would absolutely stay here again. I should mention that travel via the tube is extremely convenient as you are right across from King's Cross Station (very central).Friendly staff who helped squeeze us in when we extended our stay!
84,963,"Jul 31 2008 	Recommended highly especially for Eurostar Terminal	Stayed here both before and after a Eurostar trip. The place could not be better - located, immediately across the street therefrom. But beware ! - it's an older building right next door to Burger King so not easy to spot at first.It proved a totally excellent place to stay in every respect.The food was of a particularly high standard - no need to eat out, although there's the Betjeman Gastropub and Carluccio's opposite.Bathrooms are very modern and well-fitted with luxury toiletries [and in some much on display !!] but splashproofing of power showers and the wooden bath surrounds not too effective."
85,963,"Jul 28 2008 	Rooms are lovely but..........	Booked a Deluxe room as a treat for my husband and I. I was a little disappointed on arrival as i had to go to reception to ask for robes, slippers, complimentary water, wine and petit fours.... as they were not in room on arrival as promised on their hotel website. Never did see the &quot;petit fours&quot; or wine... as they didnt seem to have a clue as to what i was talking about!!! The room was great( clean and tidy), coffee machine was easy to use,and bed was very comfy.We didnt eat in the restaurant as thought 13.50 was a bit expensive for breakfast. The hotel is in a great spot for kings cross/st pancras as they are only across the road.Just make sure that if you book a deluxe room you receive the complementary items listed!"
86,963,"Jul 16 2008 	Good quality	Very sensibly I checked out the reviews on Tripadvisor before booking a hotel in the Euston/King Cross area - and I was really pleased with the choice I made.....so thank you all previous reviewers.This is a really nice hotel. The outside - located between a couple of fast food outlets, a bank, and a post office isn't particularly striking - but once inside it's a haven. My room, on the corner of the building, directly overlooked King's Cross Station, was spacious and very comfortable. Nice, simple, tasteful decor with good lighting. Flat screen TV gave excellent free internet access once I'd figured it out (some written instructions would be useful) - but they also supplied an ethernet cable free of charge for my laptop. Bowl of fresh fruit and big bottle of water was appreciated. Bed and pillows were very comfortable, and the double glazing and air-conditioning meant that I had a quiet night's sleep at a comfortable temp.Bathroom was lovely - although I do wonder how long the timber frame around the bath area will last without beginning to look grimy? One downside - when checking out the settings on the shower I managed to squirt water directly into my eye from one of the many squirters - and because I couldn't reach in to switch it all off without having water blasting into my face, I soaked myself and part of the bathroom! So, be warned, don't play with the settings until you're undressed and standing in the bath! Quick note about the restaurant in the basement (-1 in the lift). I tried the taster menu and it was really, really good, tasty food well-prepared.So - overall, a hit! I'll stay again."
87,963,"Jul 7 2008 	Fantastic hotel fantastic location	This hotel is absolutely fantastic, both in terms of location, being opposite the Eurostar St Pancras and Kings Cross entrances and also in terms of decor and luxury. I would go back tomorrow!!"
88,963,Jul 2 2008 	superb	This is a superb new hotel right opposite Kings Cross. The rooms are very well kitted out with the best of equipment. The hotle restraunt provides amazing dishes at not unreasonable prices. The continental breakfast was well balanced and provided good choice. Found this hotel by accident but will return the next time I am in London
89,963,Jun 20 2008 	2nd visit and superb	This is my second trip to Megaro and I have to be honest - FANTASTIC. My wife loves the Gilchrist &amp; Soames wash bags that are supplied in the rooms and comp to take away. The rooms are spacious and very well finished. Since staying here on my last visit I didn't bring my laptop because I can access my email via the flat screen TV and it's FREE. No charge - brillant if your company frowns on paying 15 - 20 for internet like mine does.The best thing is that you can be anywhere in London in 10 mins and at Eurostar checkin in under 2 mins.Had dinner and paid 15.50 for 2 courses. Service was attentive and food was fantastic and beautifully presented. The best risotto I've ever tasted.
90,963,"Jun 7 2008	Excellent Hotel in great location	I booked this hotel for a special weekend with my friends without the kids.I was given a very big room with wooden floors and a big bathroom, the toiletries come in a nice bag ideal to take home, big LCD TV. The staff at reception recommended the restaurant at check in and we decided to try it before going out the food was great and very reasonable price.Great location just across the road from St Pancras."
91,963,"May 28 2008 	Unprofessional..........	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night before a journey on Eurostar. Excellent location to St Pancras &amp; Kings Cross. The gentlemen at check in was extremely polite, friendly and professional. After his shift had finished then the customer service went severely down hill. Our room was fine for 2adults and 1 child. Beds were very comfy. The let down was that there was a limit on the volume of the tv which was located next to the window....with all the traffic noise it was difficult to hear! Great shower but a bit faddy to work out. As one of the other reviewers said the shower screens do not stop the water from going all over the bathroom floor. The whole bathroom ends up being the shower which surely is going to cause to some serious problems!Breakfast....well this was an experience. Strange restaurant/breakfast room. We were the only people having breakfast and it felt quite impersonal. There were 2 staff members just stood around and its quite a small room...no music or other noise so you feel almost like you cant talk. For a 4 star hotel the food was a massive let down. As previously mentioned very little choice. We started with grapefruit juice which was off as it had started to fizz. When we sent it back the staff tried to argue with us that it wasn't off. My partner has been a chef for 22 years working at well known hotels such as the Landmark &amp; Browns and has worked for the prime minister. He now teaches chef's so think he should know! Then the milk jug was all stained inside and when we showed this to the waitress she said that it wasn't dirty!! (white jug with brown stains) and was really rude. Next minute the chef came out and they were all quite obviously talking about us. My daughter of 7 got poached eggs on toast which came laden with sea salt! Not good for a child...an option of this would of been welcomed.Upon our checkout we decided to ask for the manager. This guy appeared who we had seen earlier walking through the breakfast room with a plate of cooked breakfast(very professional). His appearance for management staff of a 4 star hotel was a big suprise and some personal presentation skills need to be looked at here. We said that we just wanted to let him know of our bad experience so that they can prevent this from happening again. It isn't good for a new hotel to have too many complaints and was hoping that he would appreciate our feedback. Far from it, He was smarmy and again tried to argue (obviously been filled in by the previous unprofessional staff). He didn't even want to apologise...what happened to the customer is always right. This man was so clever about it all. We didn't even get a good bye when we left.Big shame about this place as the location and rooms are spot on(with only some minor adjustments needed). The big problem is the staff and services provided."
92,963,"May 2 2008 	OK but not 4-star	This is a very new hotel directly opposite St Pancras / Kings Cross. It is advertised as a 4-star hotel, with a rack rate of 330 per night, but there is currently a promotional offer on for 110 per night. I will say upfront that there is no way that this is 4-star. I would happily stay here every time for up to 150, as it is extremely well-located, but there is no way it could ever be worth 300+ per night.The drop-off outside is not terribly convenient, on the main Euston Road - very busy traffic.The lobby is quite narrow, leading to a darkish bar. Check-in was very smooth, although they seemed to have trouble with the chip and pin, and finally resorted to typing in the credit card number.The lift was tiny - 2 people with a suitcase each would pretty much fill it. Rooms were a reasonable size with good storage. However, it took ages to change the temperature - it was freezing when we arrived and took about 2 hours to warm up. The main problem is that the hotel is in an old building, and they have had to retain the sash windows. Lovely, but only single glazed. And Euston Road is INCREDIBLY busy, so there is a huge amount of traffic noise. And train announcements from the stations. Take earplugs, you will need them.The desk area was tiny, and although it had free wireless internet, the keyboard provided was in the wrong place to use conveniently with the plasma screen. OK if you have your own laptop though. My TV worked fine, but my colleague's TV buzzed loudly and irritatingly all night. He eventually managed to unplug it, but then couldn't make it work the following morning. Bed was clean and reasonably comfortable. Too many pointless cushions. Bathroom looked nice superficially, with glass splashbacks and a fancy shower. However, the floor was the cheapest, squeakiest laminate I've ever seen. Around the bath there was a sort of wooden frame, and even though the hotel has only been open a matter of weeks, this is already scuffed with splinters sticking out of it. The shower has jets and nozzles galore, but the shower screen fails to stop the water cascading across the floor. The toilet lid is too close to a small shelf which means that you catch your fingers when you open it. Toiletries were quite nice, and towels were fluffy and plentiful.Breakfast was not included, and was an absolute rip-off at 7.50 each for what was served. The dining room was not signposted at all from within the hotel, and in fact one set of reception staff sent us round the outside of the buidling - OK in May but ridiculous in the middle of winter. We were the only people having breakfast between 7.30 and 9 - very odd. There was a choice of 2 cereals, 1 type of pastry (croissant), 1 type of bread, 1 type of jam, 1 dish of tinned apricots, and 1 type of yoghurt. There were also 2 types of unlabelled jiuces which turned out to be grapefruit and pomegranate - seemed an odd choice. Staff offered stewed tea and terrible coffee, and a choice of cooked eggs, which was probably the best part. Check-out was straightforward, apart from still having no chip and pin (we tried several different cards). The only other people we saw in the hotel were all complaining about something and trying to change rooms, so possibly we had a very good experience in comparison.Overall, the location was its main advantage, and it was good value for 110 pn, but I would be reluctant to pay too much more."
93,963,"Apr 29 2008 	Loved the location	I spent 3 nights at the hotel with a group of friends and we all had a fantastic time. We wanted to stay at accommodation that would give us easy access to touring London and the Megaro was perfect. As soon as you step out their front door the steps leading to the tube are in front of you. You can travel from the hotel to anywhere in London. The staff was beyond excellent. They were friendly, courteous and always willing to serve and give assistance no matter the hour. The resturant is excellent for breakfast and dinner and the prices affordable. Our rooms were comfortable and spacious. The hotel had wireless internet in all rooms as well as plasma television sets so that you had adequate entertainment in your room if you felt like staying in. The security at the hotel was good. I observed CCTV cameras in operation at most of the main areas. I would definately stay at the Megaro if I am in London again."

1,973,Sep 12 2009 	the worst bed ever	I needed to spend a weekend in london and I booked a room in this hotel
2,973,Dec 26 2008 	You get what you pay for	It's definitely budget accommodation but that is how it is advertised. It's close to Paddington station. The staff are not helpful (not sure he spoke English very well - hard to know as he hardly spoke to me). The rooms are small (big enough for a single bed and a suitcase) but clean and contains a sink and a little balcony. Bathrooms are shared and you need to get in early before people shower as there is only a half shower screen and water goes everywhere. Breakfast is included. It's not bad but it's not great. I would recommend to anybody who is on a tight budget and I would only stay a couple of nights (anything more and it gets a little depressing).	
3,973,Sep 4 2008 	Stay Away - Unless you like Bed Bugs	Not a very good hotel. Bathroom was dirty. Asked for a better room and they said the room I had was as good as it gets.Later in the night
4,973,Jul 19 2008 	Good value great location.	It was easy to find ( although it's only one small door ) and a steep stairs up ( so you better have a good physique ). The price is extremely good value for such a location. Next to Paddington station you can get anywhere in no time.The guy behind the desk was a little bit weird. He wasn't very talkative
5,973,Jun 15 2008 	The service was amazing	We were lucky enough to find this little gem very near to Paddington Station. We were given a walk up rate of only £50 for the night which is sensational in this area. The rooms were clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities. The staff were only too happy to help what ever way they could. I would certainly sugest using this hotel if on a budget and just need something simple and clean.	
6,973,Nov 18 2008 	Hôtel pas cher		
1,974,Nov 15 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Great location. 10 minute walk from Kings X and much nearer to 3 underground stationsRoom was spotlessly clean but maybe a little smallBathroom was bigger than bedroom and fantasticBreakfast was faultless as previously describedWas easy to find - online map was perfectWe will definitely return
2,974,"Nov 14 2009 	First class service accommodation 	To all intents and purposes, this is a hotel even though it is classified as 'guest accommodation'. Don't let that put you off as it's a very comfortable and well run establishment. The rooms are simple, modern and clean, yet the little extras provided give a feeling of luxury which you don't get in most 4* hotel e.g. hand wash, hand cream, mints, bottled water on top of all the usual (shampoo, shower gel, tea/coffee making facilities etc). Breakfast also outclasses most 4* hotels too with the full range of cereals, fruit, pancakes, waffles, toast and a variety of hot cooked items. The staff are very attentive and look after your every need. Another brilliant aspect of the hotel is the location. It's very central due to its close proximity to Euston Station. You literally turn left out of the station and within 1 minute, you are at the hotel. It's easy to leave your bags there too thanks to the very secure luggage hold. All in all, we'll definitely return to this hotel for out next visit to London. Thank you MIC for a fab stay!"
3,974,"Oct 14 2009 	location location location!	Stayed here for 1 night on a Sunday Supersaver Special (or some other random alliteration of s's). Clean, spacious rooms. Fantastic service and hearty breakfast. Definitely THE place to stay in London for tourists who just wanna see the city and do not require swimming pool/sauna/gym etc etc etc"
4,974,"Sep 7 2009 	Excellent value and convenient location	I've stayed in many hotels in London over the years, some cheap and chearful and some expensive and luxurious but the MIC Hotel has been the only hotel so far to really surprise me and for all the right reasons.Located on a side street just 100m or so from Euston Station and also Euston Square you can basically get to any point in the city without any stress. Also Kings Cross and St Pancras are just a short walk away.The staff are all very friendly at the hotel and were knowledgable about the area etc and gave info with confidence.The rooms are perhaps a little small but not on London standards (quite average) but they are very tastefully decorated and designed. They also provide FAIRTRADE tea, coffe and buscuits in the room (free). My room was cleaned daily to a good standard also.The breakfast at the hotel is a little canteenish but the selection / choice of food couldn't be faulted.London is an expensive city so if you are looking to keep your standards up but keep the costs down this is a good choice place to stay and I for sure will book again."
5,974,Jul 28 2009 	Great hotel	Excellent facilities and location for Euston and good value for London - will be back
6,974,"Jul 26 2009 	excellent location	A hotel at an excellent location (between two tube stations, Euston and Euston Square) and within a network of buses. It is in a building which shares with a student accommodation, but the hotel rooms are clean and of good standard. Superb English buffet breakfast, great choice of selections (hot and cold). Staff generally friendly. Good value given the central location. Some issues with the reservation woman, she made a mistake with our booking (we booked a double room and got a single room instead)  but there was no genuine apologies. Luckily the receptionist was able to provide us with another single room free of charge."
7,974,"Jul 7 2009 	Excellent accommodation location and comfort for a reasonable price	I work down in London during the week and had been hunting round for somewhere that was a reasonable price but with a level of comfort and convenience. This place has got the lot to the extent that I've booked in for 3 months on the membership rate, which is where you really start to appreciate this hotel.The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with reliable air conditioning and good sized bathrooms. It's also quiet, which seems to be something of a rarity for central locations.The restaurant and bar area is an excellent feature, especially as a lone traveller, with the service being professional but relaxed.The breakfast in the morning is also very good, with the choice of full english or continental and the staff are very prompt in their service.Despite this being a business location for me, I would actually come to stay here for leisure trips as well."
8,974,"Apr 21 2009 	Great find lovely staff and a very convenient location!	We decided to extend our visit to London, but were amazed by the amounts being quoted for accommodation. I booked this hotel on the strength of the earlier reviews - and we were not disappointed. The offer of three nights for the price of two, made this hotel even more attractive! The hotel was very well located, with two tube stations within easy walking distance. I would recommend to others, and would not hesitate to book again if we revisited the capital."
9,974,"Apr 17 2009 	Convenient and very good value for money.	If arriving early in the day, bear in mind that check in starts at 2.00 pm.All staff were professional and helpful. The building, even though going through some refurbishment works at the time, was clean and well kept.The hotel is conveniently located near two subway stations, railway station and airport connection via King's Cross/Saint Pancras. If you don't mind walking, it takes 20 minutes from the hotel to the West End.The area is quiet and clean. The room was clean and spacious: the double bed was a super king and the en suite was very modern and clean. The room also had lots of storage space. It was functional without being too clinical.Breakfast was super: lots of variety and fresh produce to suit every need and taste."
10,974,"Feb 22 2009 	Great Location Great Price What a Find	Went for a long weekend to London with my wife and two friends. Found this hotel online and booked it on the back of the reviews in Tripadviser. Good choice.Its about a tem minute walk from St Pancras International Station/Kings Cross and Euston is literally just over the road. The rooms are small but have everything you need (its only a base anyway) and the staff very pleasant.Breakfast was excellent and lots of it, three good pubs very close by and also some good indian eateries.Easy walk into the centre of London (about 30 minutes) or pick a cab up. Five minute walk to the city bus tour stop. In summary this was a top find and we will definately be using this hotel again the next time we have a weekend in London, especially if we get the three nights for two offer again!"
11,974,"Nov 12 2008 	Modern and comfortable - very convenient for Euston	The MIC hotel is basically a floor of hotel rooms above an international student residence. But don't let that put you off. The rooms are very modern, clean and comfortable - with all the usual things you'd expect: TV, hairdryer, tea and coffee (fair trade!), etc. You get breakfast included - there was a wide choice of what to eat that included veggie cooked breakfast options. I thought a nice touch was a leaflet of prayers for peace (from all religions) that was in the room. But, although it's Methodist-run, that was the only evidence of anything religious in the hotel. The hotel is very close to Euston station. I'd definitely stay again."
12,974,"Oct 22 2008 	What a find!	This is a great place. I was staying here for the first time on business as a change from the souless places I usually frequent. It was recommended to me and what a find! Very clean and well presented small hotel. Room was pleasant, clean bathroom, good shower (always a must), modern decor, tea and coffee with yummy biscuits. Staff welcoming and helpful.They also also have a small bar and restaurant, which I didn't try but someone in the lift said it was good. Around and about are lots places to eat, 2 mins from euston sq tube and euston station, nice pub across the road called the bree louise. Overall very good value for money, good location for trains and tube, great to stay somewhere pleasant with a bit of character. I shall be staying here every time I'm in Lonon now."
13,974,"Jul 1 2008 	Excellent location great value for London!	After much research into value-priced lodging in London I ran across Methodist International Center mentioned in a Rick Steves travel guide. I checked the website and was impressed and figured that even if I paid the membership fee to get the discounted room rate I was still coming out ahead. Booking was efficient and friendly and the MIC staff was able to do it all via email, saving me an expensive phone call to London. When we arrived we were very happy with the rooms. They are small but well-appointed and the bathroom is a really nice size and efficient. For water saving they have dual flush toilets utilizing different amounts of water for different...uh...&quot;functions.&quot; Bathrooms included hand towel, floor towel and bath towel but no washcloth (seems to be common in England). They also included organic hand soap, lotion, shampoo and bath soap and the basic necessities like toilet paper and tissues. There was a hair dryer in the room but not in the bathroom. The shower was small but nice. We did find that the door had to be closed &quot;just so&quot; to keep water from getting all over the floor.The room had a nice-sized desk and chair and efficient storage with coffe/tea pot and teas and biscuits provided. Beds were comfortable but not plush and included a light wool blanket, bottom sheet and down comforter with duvet but no top sheet. This also seems common in England and is way too hot for me so I removed the duvet cover, tucked the down comforter away, and used the duvet cover as a top sheet for sleeping. A full English breakfast was served every morning buffet style which allowed you to choose your portion sizes and what you wanted. The food was very good and we were happy that the breakfast was included in the room price. The center does have a guest laundry room which we used. Unfortunately it has only 2 washing machines and 1 dryer meaning that you may have to wait a bit to share with the student residents. The machines are a bit confusing to use for us Americans only because selecting water temperature and wash settings is different than in the States. The staff had some directions posted but clearer directions would be a nice touch. The machines worked well and got our clothes clean, so no issues there.I will note a few things. 1) MIC is set up as a student center. The hotel rooms are supplementary so don't expect to get the same sort of service as you would at a Hilton or Marriott. However, we found the staff pleasant and helpful. 2) They advertise air-conditioned rooms but we found that definition to be different in England than what we would call &quot;air-conditioned&quot; in the States. There was a unit in our room but only the fan was functional. This meant that we had to open up the window and run the fan. With England's mild temperatures, this worked out just fine and we were able to achieve very pleasant and comfortable temperatures in our room however it is not air-conditioning in the &quot;freon-based&quot; sense here in the States.Last, location of this property was excellent. Only a 2 minute walk to Euston station which allowed us to easily get to any of the major tourist attractions in London with usually only 1 transfer. Euston is a nice station in that it is busy but it is on the Northern Line which seemed to us less busy than the Piccadilly or Victoria Lines. Nice way to get acclimated to the London Underground! The neighborhood was safe and clean and there was a pub just down the street that was always full of people. Street noise was minimal but I did find I used my earplugs a few nights."
14,974,"Jan 28 2008 	A really good find!	Perfect location, quiet , no chintz and contemporary furninshings. The bathroom was smart, everything was ultra clean and there was great attention to detail in the choice of fair trade and organic products in use in the room. I thought the price was really reasonable for Central London and also included a great breakfast , which all actually looked fresh and well prepared, which makes a change!! Although the room was a little small it was very comfortable and peaceful so I would say- great for a short stay and I would totally recommend this hotel."
15,974,"Sep 22 2007 	Great location great room reasonable price!	I checked numerous reviews of hotels and web sites to find a 'cheap' deal with a decent hotel for a birthday theatre trip for my girlfriend. With the Kings Cross Travel Inn fully booked, I debated various others around Bloomsbury, before stumbling upon the MIC Hotel in Euston!Its location is great, just 2 minutes walk from Euston station. We found the receptionist to be most helpful and although our room wasnt ready (only 11.45) we were able to leave our bags at the hotel for our return later to check in. The room was far better than I could have expected and the room photos on the official website do not make them look any better than they actually are. The previous reviewer was unhappy about the size which I find quite amazing considering this is a London hotel! I did see a floor plan of the hotel 3rd floor (where all the hotel rooms are) and some did seem very slightly smaller than ours but not significantly.The room itself was modern, very clean and comfortable and we quite simply, loved it! The en-suite was very small, barely room for 2 people to stand in there, but its contemporary fixtures and fittings more than made up for this.Many London hotels charge extra for breakfast (some up to 18!!!) but here it was included and was equally as good as a large 4* hotel. Huge choice and never before have I been to a hotel where they serve pancakes and waffles! The only negative point was the somewhat 'canteen' feel. You are basically sharing the room with resident students and this did make it feel a bit odd, but for us this wasnt a problem.Overall, I'd say this 'hotel' is spot on. If you want to experience a typical large 4* hotel, then this probably isnt it. However, if you want a modern, comfortable and fairly quiet stay without the fancy looking reception, 24hr rooms service and long corridors of most large hotels, then give this one some thought. At 120 it certainly wasnt cheap, but for a Monday night, I am more than happy with what we paid for. (By the way, weekends are cheaper!)"
16,974,"Aug 27 2007 	Great Location Shame about the rooms	We have just returned from a short stay at the MIC Hotel and found the hotel has: - Pleasant and helpful staff - A good location - 2 mins walk from Euston station and fair walk / short and cheap taxi ride to the nightlife- Very hearty breakfast - fruit, cereals, hot buffet, eggs of the day (cooked in front of you), pancakes and filter coffee on requestThe negatove is that we were dissapointed with the rooms - sold as 'luxury double with plasma/lcd tv'. Whilst the room was very modern in terms of decor, the rooms were incredibly small and had very little natural light . Despite the size of the room it still took us about 5 mins to find the plasma/lcd tv - its a small 15/17inch which isnt even visible from one half of the bed. Thank god we werent there for a third night due to the close quarters, but none-the-less a good solid hotel which offers fair value for money. There are cheaper hotels out there that offer as good location, bigger rooms - but dont have the glitz of this one, so as always 'each to his/her own'."
17,974,Aug 11 2007	Excellent base for business traveller	I have stayed here a number of times over the last 12 months as it was recommended by my company. I expected a low budget experience to match the price but was very pleased. Good rooms (if a bit small) but with flat screen TV and all mod cons! Only draw back I could see was if you eat in the restaurant at night it is a cafe experience rather than restaurant. But breakfast was OK.And - one room I stayed in had a strange shower arrangement where when you turned the shower on it nearly drowned me and flooded the room as it was aimed directly at the shower door and not at a shower wall!!
18,974,"Jul 7 2007 	Great hotel great location	We stayed at the MIC for five nights in late June -- two adults and two teenagers in two rooms. The location is excellent. It's two blocks from Euston Station, which provides acess to both east-west and north-south tube lines. The rooms are more modern and larger than they look on the MCI website. Breakfast was excellent. The staff was very helpful, especially the young woman at reception who was helpful with info via e-mail when were looking for a place to stay and very hospitable while we were there. There's a coin operated laundry in the basement. The bar outside the cafeteria was very pleasant for a cup of espresso or glass of wine. There are good Indian restaurants a block away and we could send the teenagers to the food court in Euston Station.I'd recommend MIC to a friend going to London."
19,974,"Apr 20 2007 	Superb in the heart of London	I have stayed here many times when in London on business. It is clean, modern and in the heart of London. Lots of nice eating places nearby, particularly if you like curries. Rooms are quiet, shower is powerful and there are lifts for those with mobility access issues."
20,974,Mar 24 2007 	value for money	I was on a two day training session being held at the MIC and was surprised to find it in a great situation and with superb bedrooms for a reasonable price.I would certainly go again and recommend it to others.The only possible downside is that as the venue is set up for both student accommodation and hotel lettings it is difficult to successfully mix both. The staff were generally attentive but need to remember that business client needs may be different to student needs and therefore the customer service should reflect this.
21,974,"Sep 6 2006 	Great Value !!	Just wanted to relay how good this place is in terms of lovely room for the money.I paid 75 per night for a double room and I was alone. I think the price was 85 for two.The room was really modern and clean. There were tea/coffee making facilities and &quot;fairtrade&quot; ginger biscuits !!The bathroom was great too.There was a flatscreen tv in the bedroom which added to the general modern &quot;feel&quot; of the room. There was also complimentary water.Breakfast was very acceptable in a sort of canteen atmosphere.Again, nice and clean.All in all excellent value for money."
22,974,"Jul 15 2006	Fantasic little hotel	The Methodist International Centre used to be student-based accommodation, (infact, a couple of floors still are), but the top floors have been renovated, and are now very swish, stylish boutique style rooms.All facilities are modern and designer, nice bathrooms with showers, flatscreen TV, designer furnature, coverings and artwork.Staff are very polite and friendly, the bar staff seemed quite new when I was there. The restaurant is great, although a little pricey. Breakfast is buffet style with loads of choice and a friendly chef. Free tea and coffee for me on arrival!Check out the rate on their website, not bad for central london, and literally 30 seconds walk from Euston. MIC isn't overtly religious either, just a normal hotel.I loved it, really nicely done."
23,974,"Mar 7 2006 	Nice Hotel .. but staff training needed!	MIC is very close to Euston Station and so I thought would be a good choice for me as I needed to catch a train very early the next morning. I found the hotel easily with a map the hotel booking agent had sent me. However, on my arrival I was greeted by a very rude girl at reception who was incredibly stroppy for her age and very unhelpful. However, once I had managed to pass her inquisition, the room I had booked seemed very nice with all the facilities you would expect from a much more expensive hotel. Sadly, my nights sleep was disturbed by constant noise from outside the hotel but overall it was fine.On leaving I then faced the receptionist again, but unfortunately it appeared that I was not the only one who had had a bad nights sleep! So, overall, I felt it was a nice hotel, and it was a shame about my poor customer experience with the reception staff. I personally won't be going back to MIC just because of this experience. I know there are plenty of other hotels to choose from in London where I might be greeted with some courtesy next time."
24,974,Nov 14 2009 	Excellent
